Manuscripts accepted for publication in any of ACM publications must be formatted using the ACM authoring template. Articles published in ACM journals and transactions are prepared for both print and digital display in the ACM Digital Library. The instructions contained herein are meant to make the process of manuscript preparation as straightforward as possible. We accept submission in either LaTeX or MS Word format.

ACM templates will very closely approximate the final output, enabling authors to judge the page-length of their published articles. However, your output is not in the final format. Your paper will be copy edited according to the *Chicago Manual of Style* and the *Merriam Webster Dictionary*, then formatted according to the ACM template. Proofs will be sent to you for final approval.

**LaTeX:** 

ACM continues to revise the Primary Article Templates to improve usability, functionality, and accessibility as needed. To ensure 100% compatibility with The ACM Publishing System (TAPS), please restrict the use of packages to the [list of approved LaTeX packages](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/accepted-latex-packages) when using the Primary Article Template to your document. The approved package webpage also provides information on how to submit additional LaTeX packages for review and adoption.

**Workflow (LaTeX):** 

1. Please use the latest version of the [**Primary Article Template - LaTeX**](https://portalparts.acm.org/hippo/latex_templates/acmart-primary.zip) to create your article submission. Use the option `manuscript` with `\documentclass[manuscript]{acmart}` command to create a single column format. 
2. Submit your paper for review.
3. There are two paths for authors to submit their source files for production processing
   1. For conferences using **vendor managed productions services**: Authors need to supply your Camera Ready (finalized) source file set to the vendor's content/production management system
   2. For conferences who are **managing production themselves**: Authors will receive an email notification with instructions to upload your Camera Ready (finalized) source file set to **The ACM Publishing System (TAPS)**. Please make sure that you and your authors approve tapsadmin@aptaracorp.awsapps.com in their email setttings to ensure that all messages from TAPS are received. Download [these instructions](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_taps.pdf) for the information on how to use TAPS. TAPS will process your paper and auto-generate proofs of your article for your review.

**Accessibility:** 

It is important that ACM authors provide descriptions for figures in their content so that ACM readers with visual impairment can be given equivalent information for these important images. Figure descriptions are complementary to figure captions and should not repeat the same information. Refer to [writing figure descriptions](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/) for guidance on writing descriptions and inserting them into your manuscript.

**Peer Review System:** 

ACM uses two manuscript tracking systems. The following journals use Aries' Editorial Manager: TEAC, TOCT and TOPC. The submission websites are: http://www.editorialmanager.com/teac/, http://www.editorialmanager.com/toct/ or http://www.editorialmanager.com/topc/

All other ACM journals use ScholarOne's ***Manuscript Central*** system to handle their submissions: http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/acm

**Fee:** 

There are no fees to submit or to publish an article in an ACM journal. However, there is an article processing charge (APC) to publish a paper as open access (OA), should you choose to do so.

**How to Submit:**

Manuscripts intended for publication should be submitted by uploading an electronic version to http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tosem

Submission requires that the lead author creates an account with his/her full contact information and a statement that the material contained in the submitted paper has not been previously published and is not currently considered for publication elsewhere. If the submission is an expanded version of a conference or workshop paper, the lead author should identify the conference or workshop and specify the differences between the submission and the conference version.

The ACM is one of several institutions that is starting to use the ORCID identification system of unique identifiers for researchers and scholars in order to improve the accuracy of bibliographic databases. If you do not already have such an identifier when you upload a new submission to ManuscriptCentral, you will be asked to visit the ORCID web site in order to get such an identification. 

**Review Process:**

Papers will be refereed in the manner customary with scientific journals before being accepted for publication. The overall process is as follows and is carried out completely within [Manuscript Central](http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tosem). (In the sequel the abbreviations EIC and AE stand for *Editor-in-Chief* and *Associate Editor*, respectively.)

1. Authors submit paper to EIC.
2. EIC selects AE according to topic of paper, absence of conflict, fair distribution of load among AE's, etc. If the EIC has a conflict of interest with any of the authors of the paper, then the EIC designates an Associate Editor from the Editorial Board to handle the duties of EIC for the full review process, and in such cases the EIC will have no further involvement with the review process.
3. AE suggests 3-4 referees to EIC.
4. EIC checks that suggested referees haven't been solicited too much recently, have no conflict of interest with the authors, etc., THEN negotiates with referees an acceptable deadline for review, THEN makes the paper available to referees in Manuscript Central. Typically, 70% of referees commit to the proposed 4 weeks, 20% to 6 weeks, and fewer than 10% up to 10 weeks.
5. AE and referees review paper.
6. EIC monitors review progress to ensure that referees meet review deadlines as much as possible.
7. WHEN all reviews have been received then EIC asks AE to propose an editorial decision together with some justification highlighting the referees' main concerns. The possible decisions are **Accept, Minor Revisions, Major Revisions, and Reject**.
8. EIC sends decision letter to authors together with referees' reports AND sends anonymous, verbatim copies and thanks to AE and referees.
9. EIC sends accepted papers to ACM for production processing.
10. For decisions of Minor Revisions and Major Revisions, authors are expected to make all revisions requested by the referees and AE before submitting a new version for review. For a previous decision of Minor Revisions, the new version typically is rechecked by AE only. For a previous decision of Major Revisions, the new version will go through a new round of reviewing, typically by the original reviewers. Papers generally are allowed at most one decision of Major Revisions. If the previous decision was Major Revisions and then the review of the new version determines that a second decision of Major Revisions is warranted, then a decision of Reject typically is applied instead. Authors have the right to submit a revision of a rejected paper as a new submission, and in some cases authors may be encouraged to do so by AE and EIC.

Correspondence on editorial matters should be addressed to [tosem@comp.nus.edu.sg](mailto:tosem@comp.nus.edu.sg). Correspondence regarding accepted papers should be addressed to the journal administrator ([tosem-admin@acm.org](mailto:tosem-admin@acm.org)) (with a copy to [tosem@comp.nus.edu.sg](mailto:tosem@comp.nus.edu.sg)).

Letters and notes of detailed technical content are considered for publication as Technical Correspondence. They are formally reviewed but are usually not refereed in the same way as short contributions or full articles.

If an author has concerns about how her or his paper was handled, that author should bring those concerns to the EIC. If the author feels that the concerns are not adequately addressed by the EIC, she or he may appeal to the Chair of the Publications Board, in accordance with ACM policy.

**Procedures for Accepted Papers:**

Once a manuscript is accepted, a final version must be submitted via the [Manuscript Central](http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tosem) website http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tosem

Submissions must follow production instructions that will be sent to the contact author. Please contact [Laura A. Lander](mailto:lander@hq.acm.org) for further details or refer to ACM's [Guidelines for Submitting Accepted Articles](https://www.acm.org/publications/submissions) for details.

Please note that it is the policy of the journal to publish any appendices greater than one page in length only in the online version of the paper in the ACM Digital Library.

Please provide a brief description of any supplementary online-only material (i.e., text and multimedia material) to be published in the Digital Library. A short "readme.txt" file will appear in the DL along with your supplementary material describing its content and whatever requirements there are for using it.

**ORCID Requirements:**

ACM requires that all accepted journal authors register and provide ACM with valid ORCIDs prior to paper publication. Corresponding authors are responsible for collecting these ORCIDs from co-authors and for providing them to ACM as part of the ACM eRights selection process. For journals using the ScholarOne submission system, the submitting author will be required to provide their own ORCID upon submission. Authors are strongly encouraged, but not required, to include ORCIDs for all authors in their source files. Please note: ACM only requires you to complete the initial ORCID registration process. However, ACM encourages you to take the additional step to claim ownership of all your published works via the ORCID site.

ORCID provides a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher through integration in key research workflows such as manuscript and grant submission and supports automated linkages between you and your professional activities - ensuring that your work receives proper recognition. This requirement will also enable ACM to provide improvements to the normalization process of ACM Digital Library author profile data, aid in the detection of undeclared conflicts of interest and other publications-related misconduct in ACM Publications, assist with the implementation of ACM Open, and offer a host of [other researcher benefits](https://info.orcid.org/benefits-for-researchers/) to ACM authors and the scientific community.

Before submission, the corresponding author should register for an ORCID. Your co-authors should also [create their individual ORCIDs](https://orcid.org/register) at that time and add them to their accounts in the manuscript submission system. Otherwise, you will need to enter them manually into the ACM rights system upon paper acceptance and before publication in the ACM Digital Library. Simple instructions for complying with this mandate are provided inside the ACM eRights system.

ORCID information for all authors will appear on the article’s page in the ACM Digital Library. If ORCIDs are included in an article’s source files, they will also be linked in the published output.

The [ACM ORCID FAQ ](https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs)should answer many of your questions.
