“天下没有免费的午餐” 。

这个短语起源于20世纪初，当时一些酒吧会提供免费的午餐以吸引顾客，但条件是他们必须买饮料。实际上，这些饮料的价格已经涵盖了午餐的成本。因此，这个表达告诉我们，世上没有真正的免费，即使看似免费的东西，往往隐藏着某种代价或附带条件。

This phrase originated in the early 20th century when some bars would offer a "free lunch" to attract patrons, but only if they bought drinks.

**释义**

“喝得酩酊大醉” 或 “烂醉如泥”。

这个短语起源于18世纪英国航海术语。在航海中，“sheet” 并不是指床单，而是操控帆的绳索。当三条绳索都松开时，船容易失控，摇摆不定，通俗来说就是东倒西歪。因此，形容一个人醉酒得控制不住自己，就像失控的船一样。

This phrase originates from 18th-century British nautical terminology. In sailing, a "sheet" does not refer to a bedsheet but to a rope that controls the sail. When three sheets are loose, the ship is hard to control and sways back and forth, much like a person who is heavily intoxicated and unsteady.

这个短语源自拳击和西方口语中，"loop"指的是一个环绕或旋转的动作。当某人的预期被剧烈地颠覆，或者发生了令人惊讶的事情，他们就有了被 “环绕” 或 “旋转” 的感觉。因此，“threw me for a loop” 表示让一个人感到非常意外和措手不及的情况。

This idiom originates from boxing and Western colloquial expressions, where "loop" refers to a circling or spinning motion. When someone's expectations are drastically overturned or something surprising happens, they feel like they've been "spun" or "looped".

**例句**

- The sudden resignation of our manager *threw me for a loop*.<br/>我们经理的突然辞职让我大吃一惊。
- His unexpected confession really *threw me for a loop*.<br/>他意外的告白让我措手不及。

This idiom doesn't have a precise origin but can be traced back to the early 20th century.
