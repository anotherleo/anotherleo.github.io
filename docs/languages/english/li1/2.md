这个短语的起源不详，但大体上可以追溯到汽车越来越普及的年代。由于坐在后座的乘客没有驾驶的责任，但又喜欢对司机指手画脚，这种行为形象直观，因此逐渐成为一种惯用表达，泛指那些喜欢对他人工作或事务指手画脚而实际并未动手的人。

This phrase's origin is unclear, but it can generally be traced back to the era when cars became more common.

This phrase originates from baseball. In baseball, the batting average is calculated on a scale of thousandths. If a player's hitting success rate is 100%, his batting average would be 1.000, or "batting a thousand."

This phrase originates from medieval hunting practices. When hunters wanted to flush out birds or game hidden in bushes, they would walk around the bushes without directly entering them.

This phrase originates from hunting periods. Hunters often needed to beat or hit bushes to flush out birds or other game, but they didn't directly rush into the bushes.

## 190. Burn bridges

## 200. Buy something for a song

**释义**

“贱价买到” 或 “非常便宜地买到某物”。

这个习语的起源可以追溯到18世纪，那时人们会通过唱歌来支付商品或服务的费用。因为歌曲本身并没有太大的金钱价值，所以这也就衍生出了 “为一首歌的价格” 这样的小意思。如今，它用来表示用极低的价格买到某物。
