This idiom originates from Greek mythology. Achilles was a Greek semi-god hero whose mother tried to make him invulnerable by dipping him in the magical River Styx. However, she held him by his heel, which did not get submerged and thus became his only vulnerable spot.

The "acid test" originates from the 19th century, where people used acidic solutions (often nitric acid) to test the purity of gold.
