This phrase originates from Joseph Heller's novel "Catch-22". In the novel, "Catch-22" describes an absurd military rule: a pilot could request to be excused from flying dangerous missions if they are sane enough to recognize the danger, but if they make such a request, they are considered sane and therefore ineligible to be excused. But if they continue to fly, it proves they are insane and eligible to be excused. This creates a paradoxical situation.

**释义**

“当场抓获” 或 “人赃并获”。

这个短语起源于15世纪的苏格兰法庭语言，即 “red hand”，指的是手上沾满新鲜血迹的人，通常是犯下谋杀罪或偷猎罪的人。这类人因为手上有罪证，即 “红手”，而被逮捕。在现代英语中，“caught red-handed” 仍然用来描述当场抓住正在进行犯罪或不当行为的人。

This phrase originates from 15th-century Scottish law court language, "red hand," referring to someone caught with fresh blood on their hands, usually in the act of murder or poaching. The term evolved such that anyone caught in the very act of committing a crime or wrongdoing was said to be "caught red-handed." In modern English, it is used to describe catching someone in the act.

This phrase originates from a common scenario where a child sneaks cookies from a jar and gets caught in the act by an adult. Consequently, it is used to describe someone being caught red-handed while doing something they shouldn't be doing, such as stealing, lying, or other improper actions.

**释义**

“在半路换马” 或 “在进行过程中改变计划或策略”。

这个成语源自美国政治家将此语用于形容在关键时刻改变领导或政策的不明智。它的背景来自换马这个实际情况，因为在河中换马非常危险且难以成功，被用来形容改变计划或策略在关键或紧张时刻是不智之举。

This idiom originates from American politicians who used it to describe the folly of changing leaders or policies at critical moments. The background comes from the actual scenario of changing horses in a river, which is dangerous and difficult to accomplish successfully, thereby used to illustrate the imprudence of changing plans or strategies during critical or tense moments.

This phrase's origin is not completely certain, but there are several popular explanations. One common belief is that the term originated from 19th-century American baseball players who used it to describe pain.

This phrase originates from Shakespeare's tragedy "Macbeth," where Macbeth declares he leads a "charmed life" (I bear a charmed life, which must not yield to one of woman born).

This phrase originates from the 19th century when schools used slates (a type of blackboard) and chalk to record students' scores. Each time the slate was wiped clean, it signified a fresh start.

This phrase originates from early 20th-century American carnivals, where target games were common. Participants would win cigars as prizes for hitting targets.

The exact origin of this phrase is debated; one theory is that it originates from a 17th-century inn in England named "Cock and Bull," where people purportedly told exaggerated and fanciful tales.

这个短语的起源有些争议，一种说法是它源自于海军用语，指的是旧时船上用来堆砌炮弹的 “黄铜猴子” 架子。在极其寒冷的天气下，黄铜会收缩，从而导致炮弹脱落。尽管这个解释被广泛接受，实际上这种说法的准确性仍有争议。

This idiom's origin is somewhat debated. One explanation is that it comes from naval terminology, referring to brass structures used to stack cannonballs on ships. In extremely cold weather, the brass would contract, causing the cannonballs to fall off. While this explanation is widely accepted, the true historical accuracy remains debated.

The origin of this phrase is unclear, but one explanation is that "cold feet" metaphorically links the physical sensation of coldness with fear or nervousness.

## 258. Cold shoulder

**释义**

“冷遇” 或 “冷淡对待”。

这个短语起源于19世纪，当时冷的肩膀肉是在社交场合上不受欢迎的客人们接待饮食时的象征。因此，“cold shoulder” 被用来形容故意忽略或冷淡对待某人。它表示在某种程度上对他人表现出冷淡和不友好的态度。

This phrase originated in the 19th century when a cold shoulder of mutton was a symbol of poor hospitality towards unwanted guests. Therefore, "cold shoulder" has been used to describe deliberately ignoring or being unfriendly to someone. It indicates showing a somewhat indifferent or unfriendly attitude towards others.

This phrase can trace its origin to the situation where an item sitting somewhere unused for a long time accumulates dust. Therefore, "collecting dust" has come to describe items that haven't been used for a long time or at all, just taking up space. It can be used to describe objects, equipment, and even plans and projects.

**例句**

- My old guitar has been *collecting dust* in the closet.<br/>我的旧吉他一直放在壁橱里积灰。
