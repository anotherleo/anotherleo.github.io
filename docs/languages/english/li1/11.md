This phrase's exact origin is unclear, but a common theory is that it comes from children's games or roughhousing, where one child would force another to say "uncle" as a way of asking for mercy.

This phrase originates from the Bible, specifically the Book of Leviticus 16, where on the Day of Atonement, the priest Aaron would send a goat into the wilderness, symbolically carrying the sins of the Israelites.
