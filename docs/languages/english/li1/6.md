This phrase originates from the legal principle of presumption of innocence, where if there isn't enough evidence to prove someone's guilt, the judicial system will choose to believe the person is innocent.

“摆脱他们” 或 “甩开他们”。

这个短语起源于19世纪，意指通过巧妙的手段从某个别人不想你离开的场合逃脱。在那时，如果有人用 “给你一张纸条（slip you a note）” 等同于偷偷摸摸给信息，因此 “给他们纸条” 逐渐演变为 “摆脱他们”。

This phrase originated in the 19th century, meaning to escape from a place or situation that others do not want you to leave, often using clever means.

This phrase originates from woodworking terminology. In woodworking, cutting along the grain is the easiest and most effective, while cutting against the grain is laborious and may cause the wood to splinter.

This phrase originated in American slang in the mid-20th century and is often used to describe someone who suddenly becomes extremely excited, angry, or exhibits irrational behavior.

This phrase originates from the imagery of fish turning belly up when they die, floating on the water surface with their bellies facing up, signifying they are dead.

This phrase originates from slang appearing around the 1940s, meaning to lose control or act unusually.

This phrase originates from the process of quitting drugs or alcohol, indicating the sudden complete stop of using a substance instead of a gradual reduction.

This phrase is a lively expression in English similar to telling someone to "get lost" or "mind their own business."

**释义**

“失控” 或 “乱套”。

“Go haywire” 这个短语源自于19世纪，当时的农民们使用一种叫做 “干草电线”（haywire）的铁丝将干草捆绑在一起。这些铁丝常常会因为使用频繁而缠绕在一起，成为杂乱无章、难以处理的状态。因此，这个短语后来用以表示某事物变得混乱失控、不再按照正常情况运行。

This idiom originates from the 19th century when farmers used a wire called "haywire" to bundle hay. These wires often became tangled and difficult to manage due to frequent use.

This idiom originates from the mechanism of old firearms. If the gun's trigger was not fully cocked (i.e., in a "half-cocked" state), it could misfire or discharge unexpectedly, leading to unintended consequences.

This phrase can be traced back to swimming pools, which usually have a shallow end and a deep end. The shallow end is safer, while the deep end requires higher swimming skills.

In origins dating back to the late 19th century, the phrase "the third degree" was associated with a tough level of interrogation or coercion by police.
