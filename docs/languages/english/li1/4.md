## 301. Cut to the chase

**释义**

“直奔主题” 或 “切入正题”。

这个短语起源于早期的好莱坞默片时代，观众往往在观看电影时更喜欢直接看到精彩的动作场面而不耐烦冗长的铺垫，因此 “cut to the chase” 实际是指在电影制作时跳过不必要的情节直接进入追逐戏。后来，这个短语逐渐演变为指在任何情况下直接切入核心议题或主题，避免不必要的铺垫或引言。

This phrase originated from the early days of Hollywood silent films, where viewers often preferred to see exciting action scenes instead of long-winded setups. Hence, "cut to the chase" literally meant to skip straight to the chase scenes in movies. Over time, the phrase has evolved to mean getting to the main point in any context, avoiding unnecessary preamble or delays.

**例句**

- Let's cut to the chase—how much is this going to cost?<br/>我们直奔主题吧——这要花多少钱？
- We don't have much time, so I'll cut to the chase.<br/>我们时间不多，所以我就切入正题了。
- Stop beating around the bush and cut to the chase!<br/>别拐弯抹角了，直奔主题吧！

## 302. Cut to the quick

**释义**

“伤害到痛处” 或 “深深地伤害”。

这个短语源自中世纪英语，其中 “quick” 一词指的是指甲下面柔嫩的皮肤。切到 “quick” 会带来非常强烈的疼痛，因此这个表达用来形容某事对某人造成了深深的伤害或触动了他们的痛处。

The phrase originates from Middle English, where "quick" referred to the tender flesh under the fingernail. Cutting the "quick" would cause intense pain, hence the expression is used to describe something that causes deep emotional hurt or strikes a sensitive nerve.

- The criticism *cut him to the quick* and left him feeling devastated.<br/>批评深深刺痛了他，让他感到毁灭般的痛苦。

## 303. Cute as a bug

**释义**

“像虫子一样可爱” 或 “非常可爱”。

这个短语似乎起源于美国南方，对小孩或者小动物的可爱形象做出一种夸张的、带有乡村风味的形容。在这些地区，“bug” 并不以虫子本身的形象来理解，而更多的是指那些小巧、天真、讨人喜欢的生物。

This phrase appears to have originated in the Southern United States, where it is used as an exaggerated and folksy way to describe the cuteness of children or small animals. In these regions, "bug" is not understood in its literal sense but rather as a term for tiny, innocent, and charming creatures.

**释义**

“用轻微的赞美来贬低某人” 或 “明褒实贬”。

这个短语起源于古希腊和罗马的文学传统，当时作家们常常用微不足道的赞美来讽刺或贬低他人。给予某人非常轻微的赞美，会让人觉得这个人并不值得更多的认可，从而起到贬低的效果。

This phrase originates from the literary traditions of ancient Greece and Rome, where writers would use slight praise as a tool for satire or to demean someone. By giving someone only faint praise, it implies that the person is not worthy of significant recognition, thereby having a diminishing effect.

The phrase "dead ringer" originates from the 19th-century American horse racing culture.

“不做无用功” 或 “不要再纠缠无效的事情”。

This phrase is commonly used as a humorous or sarcastic comment when someone attempts an activity (like performing or singing) and doesn’t do it particularly well.

This phrase originates from the anxious feeling of holding one's breath while waiting for something to happen, suggesting that something is unlikely to happen soon or at all.

**释义**

“不要挑剔别人送的礼物” 或 “不要对别人送的礼物吹毛求疵”。

这个短语源于古老的习惯，即通过查看马的牙齿来判断马的年龄和健康状况。因此，当有人送你一匹马时，检查其牙齿被视为不礼貌和感恩的表现。这个成语在现代用来提醒人们要对别人的好意表示感激，而不是挑剔那些免费得到的东西。

This idiom originates from the old practice of checking a horse's teeth to determine its age and health.

**释义**

“不要把所有鸡蛋都放在一个篮子里”，意思是不要把所有的资源或希望都集中在一个地方或一个项目上，以避免风险集中而导致全部损失。

这个短语的起源很显然是来自于一种简单直观的比喻：如果把所有的鸡蛋都放在同一个篮子里，一旦篮子掉地，所有的鸡蛋都会摔碎。而如果分散到不同的篮子里，即使一个篮子掉了，还有其他的鸡蛋能够保存完好。这句话被用来强调在投资、决策或追求目标时，分散风险的重要性。

This idiom originates from a simple and intuitive analogy: if you put all your eggs in one basket and the basket falls, all the eggs will break. But if you spread them across different baskets, even if one basket falls, some eggs will remain intact. It emphasizes the importance of diversifying risk in investments, decisions, or pursuits to prevent total loss.

This phrase is derived from the practice of discouraging others from citing or repeating one’s words as definitive or fully accurate. It is generally used to convey a sense of caution that the information or opinion shared is not guaranteed to be 100% correct, and to avoid responsibility for potential inaccuracies.

This phrase originates from an old practice where the whole family would bathe in the same water, with the smallest baby being the last to use the dirty water.

这个短语的起源可以追溯到19世纪。当时，英国人有时会插入法语单词或短语来显得自己更有学识。然而，听众不一定懂法语，所以说话者会道歉说 “Excuse my French”，意思是对那些不懂法语的人表达歉意。随着时间的流逝，这个短语的含义逐渐转变，用来在说出不雅言辞之前或之后道歉，即表示对粗俗语言的歉意。

This phrase can be traced back to the 19th century when English speakers would sometimes insert French words or phrases to appear more educated.

This idiom's origin is not entirely clear, but there are two main theories. The first one relates to the military tradition where soldiers had to face their fate in a ceremony accompanied by music. The second theory is linked to theatrical performances, where actors had to face the audience's applause or boos.

**释义**

“酒肉朋友” 或 “只能同享乐不能共患难的朋友”。

这个短语的来历可以追溯到 16 世纪。当时，"fair weather" 指的是好天气，因而 "fair-weather friend" 意味着只在好天气时陪伴你的人，暗指那些只在你处于顺境时才是你朋友的人。在现代英语中，这个短语形象地比喻了那些在你顺境时对你热情，而在你困境时远离你的朋友。

The origin of this idiom can be traced back to the 16th century. At that time, "fair weather" referred to good weather, so a "fair-weather friend" was someone who was only around you during good times.

## 389. Fall by the wayside

**释义**

“半途而废” 或 “被忽视”。

这个成语起源于《圣经》的比喻故事，尤其是撒种的比喻。种子（象征着好意、努力等）落在路边（wayside）时，通常无法生长和繁荣。因此，“fall by the wayside” 表示某事在实现过程中失败或者被人忽视和放弃。

This idiom originates from the parable of the sower in the Bible. Seeds (symbolizing good intentions, efforts, etc.) that fall by the wayside typically do not grow and thrive. Hence, "fall by the wayside" means that something fails in the process of being achieved or is neglected and abandoned.
