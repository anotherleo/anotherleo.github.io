This idiom originates from Greek mythology. Achilles was a Greek semi-god hero whose mother tried to make him invulnerable by dipping him in the magical River Styx. However, she held him by his heel, which did not get submerged and thus became his only vulnerable spot.

## 120. Beating a dead horse

**释义**

“徒劳无功”，意为做无效、无意义的事情，白费力气。

这个短语的起源可以追溯到英国，最早见于 19 世纪。它来源于驾马时使用的鞭子，鞭打已经死去的马当然是无济于事的，因而用于形容徒劳无功的行为。现代这个短语常用来形容重复做某件已被证明无效的事情，从而浪费时间和精力。

This idiom originates from the United Kingdom and was first seen in the 19th century. It comes from the imagery of whipping a horse that has already died, which is clearly pointless.

This phrase originates from hunting periods. Hunters often needed to beat or hit bushes to flush out birds or other game, but they didn't directly rush into the bushes. In language, "beating around the bush" means that people don't directly get to the point when discussing issues or expressing thoughts but instead talk around it.

**例句**

This idiom is used to describe hair that is messy and tousled after getting out of bed. Because tossing and turning during sleep can make hair disheveled, this condition is termed "bed head."

- I looked in the mirror and saw bed head like never before.<br/>我照了照镜子，看到了自己前所未有的凌乱头发。

This phrase originates from Joseph Heller's novel "Catch-22". In the novel, "Catch-22" describes an absurd military rule: a pilot could request to be excused from flying dangerous missions if they are sane enough to recognize the danger, but if they make such a request, they are considered sane and therefore ineligible to be excused.

This phrase originates from 15th-century Scottish law court language, "red hand," referring to someone caught with fresh blood on their hands, usually in the act of murder or poaching.

This idiom originates from American politicians who used it to describe the folly of changing leaders or policies at critical moments.

这个短语的起源并不完全确定，但有几种流行的解释。一个常见的说法是，这种表达源自19世纪美国棒球运动员对疼痛的形容。另一个说法是，一个叫查理的马，经常用于拖运球员和设备，当它劳累时常出现类似的症状。因此，“Charley horse” 被用于描述类似的肌肉痉挛或抽筋。

This phrase's origin is not completely certain, but there are several popular explanations. One common belief is that the term originated from 19th-century American baseball players who used it to describe pain.

This idiom's origin is somewhat debated. One explanation is that it comes from naval terminology, referring to brass structures used to stack cannonballs on ships.

这个短语的起源可以追溯到航海术语。绳索被拉得紧紧的，没有任何放松的余地时，会使得船员感到紧张，但如果给他们一些 “slack”（松弛），就意味着减少一些压力，给他们更多的余地。在现代社会中，这个短语变成了日常用语，用于建议对某人宽容一些，特别是在他们遇到困难或者压力大的情况下。

This phrase originates from nautical terminology. When a rope is pulled tight with no slack, it creates tension for the sailors, but giving them some slack means reducing the tension, providing them more leeway.

“直奔主题” 或 “切入正题”。

This phrase originated from the early days of Hollywood silent films, where viewers often preferred to see exciting action scenes instead of long-winded setups.

**释义**

“不要把所有鸡蛋都放在一个篮子里”，意思是不要把所有的资源或希望都集中在一个地方或一个项目上，以避免风险集中而导致全部损失。

这个短语的起源很显然是来自于一种简单直观的比喻：如果把所有的鸡蛋都放在同一个篮子里，一旦篮子掉地，所有的鸡蛋都会摔碎。而如果分散到不同的篮子里，即使一个篮子掉了，还有其他的鸡蛋能够保存完好。这句话被用来强调在投资、决策或追求目标时，分散风险的重要性。

This idiom originates from a simple and intuitive analogy: if you put all your eggs in one basket and the basket falls, all the eggs will break. But if you spread them across different baskets, even if one basket falls, some eggs will remain intact. It emphasizes the importance of diversifying risk in investments, decisions, or pursuits to prevent total loss.

This phrase is derived from the practice of discouraging others from citing or repeating one’s words as definitive or fully accurate. It is generally used to convey a sense of caution that the information or opinion shared is not guaranteed to be 100% correct, and to avoid responsibility for potential inaccuracies.

**释义**

“酒肉朋友” 或 “只能同享乐不能共患难的朋友”。

这个短语的来历可以追溯到 16 世纪。当时，"fair weather" 指的是好天气，因而 "fair-weather friend" 意味着只在好天气时陪伴你的人，暗指那些只在你处于顺境时才是你朋友的人。在现代英语中，这个短语形象地比喻了那些在你顺境时对你热情，而在你困境时远离你的朋友。

The origin of this idiom can be traced back to the 16th century. At that time, "fair weather" referred to good weather, so a "fair-weather friend" was someone who was only around you during good times.

## 389. Fall by the wayside

“半途而废” 或 “被忽视”。

这个成语起源于《圣经》的比喻故事，尤其是撒种的比喻。种子（象征着好意、努力等）落在路边（wayside）时，通常无法生长和繁荣。因此，“fall by the wayside” 表示某事在实现过程中失败或者被人忽视和放弃。

This idiom originates from the parable of the sower in the Bible. Seeds (symbolizing good intentions, efforts, etc.) that fall by the wayside typically do not grow and thrive. Hence, "fall by the wayside" means that something fails in the process of being achieved or is neglected and abandoned.

**例句**

- Many good ideas *fall by the wayside* due to lack of funding.<br/>许多好主意因为缺乏资金而半途而废。

This phrase originally referred to people who, after quitting alcohol, start drinking again. In the late 19th century, America saw a temperance movement, and those who joined the temperance pledge would say they were "on the wagon".

这个短语起源于19世纪，意指通过巧妙的手段从某个别人不想你离开的场合逃脱。在那时，如果有人用 “给你一张纸条（slip you a note）” 等同于偷偷摸摸给信息，因此 “给他们纸条” 逐渐演变为 “摆脱他们”。

This phrase originated in the 19th century, meaning to escape from a place or situation that others do not want you to leave, often using clever means. During that time, if someone "slipped you a note", it implied secretly providing information, hence "give them the slip" evolved to mean escaping or shaking off.

## 508. Go against the grain

**释义**

“逆势而为” 或 “违反常理”。

这个短语起源于木工加工中的术语。在木工中，沿着木纹切割是最容易和最有效的，而逆着木纹切割（go against the grain）则费力且可能导致木材破裂。因此，这个表达逐渐用来形容做事不顺从常理，或与众不同的方式。

This phrase originates from woodworking terminology. In woodworking, cutting along the grain is the easiest and most effective, while cutting against the grain is laborious and may cause the wood to splinter. Therefore, this expression gradually came to describe doing things in a way that defies convention or is uniquely different.

- He always likes to *go against the grain* and do things differently.<br/>他总喜欢逆势而为，用不同的方式做事。

This phrase originates from the process of quitting drugs or alcohol, indicating the sudden complete stop of using a substance instead of a gradual reduction.

**释义**

“失控” 或 “乱套”。

“Go haywire” 这个短语源自于19世纪，当时的农民们使用一种叫做 “干草电线”（haywire）的铁丝将干草捆绑在一起。这些铁丝常常会因为使用频繁而缠绕在一起，成为杂乱无章、难以处理的状态。因此，这个短语后来用以表示某事物变得混乱失控、不再按照正常情况运行。

This idiom originates from the 19th century when farmers used a wire called "haywire" to bundle hay. These wires often became tangled and difficult to manage due to frequent use.

**释义**

“未做好准备就行动” 或 “鲁莽行事”。

这个短语起源于旧式火枪的发射机制。如果火枪的扳机没有完全扣紧（即 “半扣” 状态），可能会导致意外走火，没有达到预期效果。因而，“Go off half-cocked” 引申为在没有充分准备或考虑的情况下仓促行事、冒失行动。

This idiom originates from the mechanism of old firearms. If the gun's trigger was not fully cocked (i.e., in a "half-cocked" state), it could misfire or discharge unexpectedly, leading to unintended consequences.

This phrase can be traced back to swimming pools, which usually have a shallow end and a deep end. The shallow end is safer, while the deep end requires higher swimming skills.

**例句**

This idiom originates from the idea of climbing a tree and standing on a limb (a branch), where the further out you go the less stable and more risky it becomes.

This phrase originated in the 1980s in the United States following several instances where postal workers committed acts of workplace violence due to excessive stress. Although such incidents were not widespread, "go postal" has since become an expression used to describe someone suddenly going into a violent rage or losing control.

This phrase originates from the New Testament in the Bible, specifically Matthew 5:41, where Jesus said, "If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles."

The exact origin of this phrase is not entirely clear. Some researchers believe it derives from the 18th-century American coal miners who would transport coal in baskets to the surface, and sometimes these baskets would fall into deep pits.

This phrase has its origins in fire. When an object catches fire, it turns into smoke and vanishes completely, symbolizing something that was tangible but has now disappeared. Thus, "go up in smoke" signifies that a hope, plan, or effort has suddenly and completely vanished, just like smoke.

This idiom can be traced back to medieval Europe. Houses often had mice, and people relied on cats to catch these pests. If a cat smelled a rat, it would become extraordinarily alert.

**释义**

“锅嫌壶黑” 或 “五十步笑百步”。

这个成语的来源可以追溯到17世纪。当时，人们通常使用铁锅和铁壶作为炊具，它们在火上经过一段时间的使用后都会变黑。因此，当一只已经变黑的锅指责同样变黑的壶时，这种指责就是自相矛盾的。这一成语常用于形容某人指责别人的弱点或缺点，但自己也有同样的弱点或缺点。

This idiom dates back to the 17th century. Back then, people commonly used iron pots and kettles for cooking, which would turn black due to the soot from the fire.

**例句**

This phrase originates from a poem by American poet Robert Frost titled "The Road Not Taken". In the poem, the poet chooses a less-traveled path, symbolizing his unusual and distinctive decisions in life.

This phrase originates from the Bible, specifically Matthew 7:14, which states "narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it."

“天下没有免费的午餐” 。

This phrase originated in the early 20th century when some bars would offer a "free lunch" to attract patrons, but only if they bought drinks.

**释义**

“喝得酩酊大醉” 或 “烂醉如泥”。

这个短语起源于18世纪英国航海术语。在航海中，“sheet” 并不是指床单，而是操控帆的绳索。当三条绳索都松开时，船容易失控，摇摆不定，通俗来说就是东倒西歪。因此，形容一个人醉酒得控制不住自己，就像失控的船一样。

This phrase originates from 18th-century British nautical terminology. In sailing, a "sheet" does not refer to a bedsheet but to a rope that controls the sail.

This idiom originates from boxing and Western colloquial expressions, where "loop" refers to a circling or spinning motion. When someone's expectations are drastically overturned or something surprising happens, they feel like they've been "spun" or "looped".

This idiom doesn't have a precise origin but can be traced back to the early 20th century.

这个短语来源于东南亚，尤其是泰国和缅甸。在这些地区，白象被认为是神圣的动物。历史上，一些君主会赠送白象作为礼物，虽然这些动物非常稀有和珍贵，但它们的维护费用极高，而且无法用于劳动，因此，收礼者常常很难负担这样的昂贵礼物。因此，“white elephant” 转而用以形容那些看似珍贵但无用且昂贵的事物。

This phrase originates from Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Myanmar, where white elephants were considered sacred animals. Historically, some monarchs would gift a white elephant, an extremely rare and precious animal, but its upkeep was very expensive and it couldn't be used for labor.

- That huge, expensive vase is a *white elephant*. It just takes up space and collects dust.<br/>那个巨大的昂贵花瓶简直就是一个无用的东西，只是占地方和积灰。
