# All Your Ideas Can Become True

Is there a strength that leads your life? Is there a more ==sublime== strength that directs your road?

The Now is inseparable from who you are at the deepest level.

Many things in your life matter but only one thing matters absolutely.

It matters whether you succeed or fail in the eyes of the world. It matters whether you are healthy or not healthy, whether you are educated or not educated. It matters whether you are rich or poor—it certainly makes a difference in your life.

Yes, all these things matter, relatively speaking. But they don’t matter absolutely. There is something that matters more than any of those things and that is **finding the essence of who you are beyond that short-lived entity, that short-lived personalized sense of self**.

You find peace not by rearranging the circumstances of your life but by realizing who you are at the deepest level.

Just as water can be solid, liquid, or gaseous, consciousness can be seen to be frozen as physical matter, “liquid” as mind and thought, or formless as pure consciousness. Pure consciousness is Life before it comes into manifestation and that Life looks at the world of form through “your” eyes because consciousness is who you are. When you know yourself as That, then you recognize yourself in everything. It is a state of complete clarity of perception. You are no longer an entity with a heavy past that becomes a screen of concepts through which every experience is interpreted. When you perceive without interpretation, you can then sense what it is that is perceiving. The most we can say in language is that there is a field of alert stillness in which the perception happens. Through “you”, formless consciousness has become aware of itself.

就像水有固态、液态和气态一样，意识也以不同的方式呈现，可以被“固化”成物质，“液化”成大脑和思想，或“气化”成无形又纯粹的意识。纯粹的意识呈现之前是生命，这个生命通过你的双眼观看这个世界，因为你就是意识。认识到这点，你就能在万物之中发现自己。这是一个完全清醒的觉知状态。你不再是一个承载着沉重过去的实体，不再是诠释一切经历的概念屏幕。停止以诠释的方式观察这个世界，方能觉察到事物的真实本质。语言所能表达的无外乎是：有一个警觉的宁静领域，知觉在此产生。经由你，无形的意识觉察到了它自己。

Most people’s lives are run by desire and fear. Desire is the need to “add” something to yourself in order to “be” yourself more fully. All fear is the fear of “losing” something, and thereby becoming diminished and being less. These two movements obscure the fact that being cannot be given or taken away. Being in its fullness is already within you, Now.
