# Ch1 The Flowering of Human Consciousness

## Evocation

Earth, 114 million years ago, one morning just after sunrise: The first flower ever to appear on the planet opens up to receive the rays of the sun. Prior to this momentous event that heralds an evolutionary transformation in the life of plants, the planet had already been covered in vegetation for millions of years. The first flower probably did not survive for long, and flowers must have remained rare and isolated phenomena, since conditions were most likely not yet favorable for a widespread flowering to occur. One day, however, a critical threshold was reached, and suddenly there would have been an explosion of color and scent all over the planet if a perceiving consciousness had been there to witness it.

地球，一亿一千四百万年前，一个旭日初升的清晨：

在这个星球上有史以来的第一朵花，正绽放开来迎向阳光。这是宣告植物生命进化转变的关键事件，虽然在此之前，植物早已经覆盖这个星球好几百万年了。当时的条件可能并不适合花儿遍地绽放，因此，这第一朵花也许很快就凋谢了，而花朵的绽放在当时也必定是相当罕见的。然而，有一天，当一个关键性的临界点到达时，突然之间，整个星球到处弥漫着各式各样的色彩和芳香——如果有一个观照的意识在此观察，就会目睹这一切的发生。

Much later, those delicate and fragrant beings we call flowers would come to play an essential part in the evolution of consciousness of another species. Humans would increasingly be drawn to and fascinated by them. As the consciousness of human beings developed, flowers were most likely the first thing they came to value that had no utilitarian purpose for them, that is to say, was not linked in some way to survival. They provided inspiration to countless artists, poets, and mystics. Jesus tells us to contemplate the flowers and learn from then how to live. The Buddha is said to have given a silent sermon once during which he held up a flower and gazed at it. After a while, one of those present, a monk called Mahakasyapa, began to smile. He is said to have been the only one who had understood the sermon. According to legend, that smile (that is to say, realization) was handed down by twenty eight successive masters and much later became the origin of Zen.

多年以后，这些优雅而芬芳，我们称之为“花朵”的存在，在另外一个物种的意识进化当中扮演了关键性的角色：人类逐渐地被花朵吸引并为之着迷。随着人类意识的进化发展，花朵极有可能是人类所珍视的事物当中，第一个没有实用价值而且与生存无关的。花朵也为无数的艺术家、诗人、神秘学家带来了灵感。耶稣教导我们：从对花朵的省思中，向它们学习如何生活。据说佛陀曾经在一次默示中，拈花不语，只是凝视着它。半晌，一位名叫大迦叶的僧人，若有所悟地开始微笑。据说他是唯一领悟了这个开示的人。根据传说，那个微笑（也就是说，那个领悟）被二十八位大师相继传承下来，后来就成为了禅宗的起源。

Seeing beauty in a flower could awaken humans, however briefly, to the beauty that is an essential part of their own innermost being, their true nature. The first recognition of beauty was one of the most significant events in the evolution of human consciousness. The feelings of joy and love are intrinsically connected to that recognition. Without our fully realizing it, flowers would become for us an expression in form of that which is most high, most sacred, and ultimately formless within ourselves. Flowers, more fleeting, more ethereal and more delicate than the plants out of which they emerged, would become like messengers from another realm, like a bridge between the world of physical forms and the formless. They not only had a scent that was delicate and pleasing to humans, but also brought a fragrance from the realm of spirit. Using the word enlightenment in a wider sense than the conventionally accepted one, we could look upon flowers as the enlightenment of plants.

看出花朵的美丽，能够唤醒人类（无论多么短暂）去正视他们自己最深处的本体（being）——也就是他们的本质——之中的美丽。首度体会到“美”，是人类意识进化过程当中最重要的事件之一。因为喜悦和爱的感觉是与那个体会息息相关的。如果没有这样全然的领悟，花朵就不会成为我们内在深处那至高至圣、无形无相的一种有形的表达。和孕育它们的植物相比，花朵是瞬间即逝、脱俗空灵（ethereal）、更为娇贵的。它们仿佛是从另外一个领域来的信使，是有形世界和无形世界之间的桥梁。它们不但具有令人愉悦而且优雅的香味，同时也带来了来自心灵世界的芬芳。如果我们用比较广泛的定义来使用“开悟”这个字，而不是从传统定义上来说的话，我们可以把花朵视为“开悟”的植物。

Any life-form in any realm mineral, vegetable, animal, or human can be said to undergo enlightenment. It is, however, an extremely rare occurrence since it is more than an evolutionary progression: It also implies a discontinuity in its development, a leap to an entirely different level of Being and, most important, a lessening of materiality.

任何领域的生命形式——举凡矿物、植物、动物或是人类，都可以说在经历“开悟”的过程。然而开悟是极为稀有的，因为它不仅仅是进化上的一个突破——它同时意味着发展中的一个断层，从不同层次的本体跳跃到另一个。而更重要的一点是：物质性的减少。

What could be heavier and more impenetrable than a rock, the densest of all forms? And yet some rocks undergo a change in their molecular structure, turn into crystals, and so become transparent to the light. Some carbons, under inconceivable heat and pressure, turn into diamonds, and some heavy minerals into other precious stones.

有什么东西会比石头（最密实的一种物质形式）更为沉重而且不容易穿透的呢？然而有些岩石的分子结构经历了一些转变，变成了透光的水晶。有些碳元素，经过无法想象的高温和高压，转化为钻石，而有些重矿物则转变成为宝石。

Most crawling reptilians, the most earthbound of all creatures, have remained unchanged for millions of years. Some, however, grew feathers and wings and turned into birds, thus defying the force of gravity that had held them for so long. They didnt become better at crawling or walking, but transcended crawling and walking entirely.

大部分在地上爬行的爬行类（最固着于土地的生物），几百万年来都毫无改变。然而它们之中，有些后来却长出了羽毛和翅膀，变成了鸟类，抗拒了长久以来拖住它们的地心引力。它们从爬行类进化为鸟类，并不是变得更善于爬行或是步行，而是完全超越了这些行为。

Since time immemorial, flowers, crystals, precious stones, and birds have held special significance for the human spirit. Like all life?forms, they are, of course, temporary manifestations of the underlying one Life, one Consciousness. Their special significance and the reason why humans feel such fascination for and affinity with them can be attributed to their ethereal quality.

自远古以来，花朵、水晶、宝石和鸟类就一直对人类心灵有着重要的意义。就像所有的生命形式一样，它们当然也是万物之中的那个至一生命（onelife）、至一意识（oneconsiousness）的短暂显化（manifestation）。它们对人类之所以会有如此特殊的重要意义，以及人类之所以会对它们如此着迷并感觉亲切，就是因为它们脱俗空灵的特质。

Once there is a certain degree of presence, of still and alert attention in human beings perceptions, they can sense the divine life essence, the one indwelling consciousness or spirit in every creature, every life-form, recognize it as one with their own essence and so love it as themselves. Until this happens, however, most humans see only the outer forms, unaware of the inner essence, just as they are unaware of their own essence and identify only with their own physical and psychological form.

人类的认知（perception）当中，一旦有了一定程度的临在（presence）、定静和警觉，他们就能够感受到神圣生命的本质，这本质就是在每个创造物和每个生命形式当中永存的意识或灵性，同时人们也能够认识到，它和人类自身的本质是合一的，所以能够爱它如己。然而，除非上述这种情形能够发生，否则大部分的人类只能看到这些生命的外在形相，而无法觉察到它们内在的本质，就像人类只会认同于他们自己肉体和心理上的形相，而无法觉察到自己的本质一样。

In the case of a flower, a crystal, precious stone, or bird, however, even someone with little or no Presence can occasionally sense that there is more than the mere physical existence of that form, without knowing that this is the reason why he or she is drawn toward it, feels an affinity with it. Because of its ethereal nature, its form obscures the indwelling spirit to a lesser degree than is the case with other life-forms. The exception to this are all newborn life-forms babies, puppies, kittens, lambs, and so on. They are fragile, delicate, not yet firmly established in materiality. An innocence, a sweetness and beauty that are not of this world still shine through them. They delight even relatively insensitive humans.

然而，对于花朵、水晶、宝石或是鸟类来说，即使一个没有临在，或是临在很少的人，都可能偶尔感受到：在这些物质存在的形相之外，有更多难以言喻的东西。而这些人可能完全不知道，这就是他们会被这些东西吸引并且感觉如此亲切的原因。

由于花朵空灵的本质，相较于其他的生命形式，它的外相比较不会遮掩其永存的灵性。但是还有一个例外，那就是——所有新生的生命形式——婴儿、小狗、小猫、小羊等，它们是如此脆弱、娇柔，在物质世界中尚未完全成形。天真、娇柔和美丽——这些不属于这个尘世的特质，还是能够从它们的内在闪耀出来。它们甚至会让那些感觉比较迟钝的人都忍不住开心起来。

So when you are alert and contemplate a flower, crystal, or bird without naming it mentally, it becomes a window for you into the formless. There is an inner opening, however slight, into the realm of spirit. This is why these three enlightened life-forms have played such an important part in the evolution of human consciousness since ancient times; why, for example, the jewel in the lotus flower is a central symbol of Buddhism and a white bird, the dove, signifies the Holy Spirit in Christianity. They have been preparing the ground for a more profound shift in planetary consciousness that is destined to take place in the human species. This is the spiritual awakening that we are beginning to witness now.

所以，当你全神贯注，并且对着一朵花、一颗水晶或一只小鸟沉思冥想，但在心智（mind）上不去定义它们的时候，它们就会成为你进入无形世界的一扇窗户。你的内在会有个开启（即使很小），让你因而进入心灵的领域。这就是为什么自古以来，这三种“开悟”的生命形式，在人类的意识进化上扮演了非常重要的角色。比方说，莲花之宝是佛教的一个重要象征，而白鸽，在基督教中代表着圣灵。它们一直在为人类注定要发生的一个更深远的地球意识转化奠定基础，而这正是我们现在开始目睹到的心灵觉醒的现象。

## The Purpose of This Book

Is humanity ready for a transformation of consciousness, an inner flowering so radical and profound that compared to it the flowering of plants, no matter how beautiful, is only a pale reflection? Can human beings lose the density of their conditioned mind structures and become like crystals or precious stones, so to speak, transparent to the light of consciousness? Can they defy the gravitational pull of materialism and materiality and rise above identification with form that keeps the ego in place and condemns them to imprisonment within their own personality?

人类已经为意识转化做好准备了吗？这个内在意识的绽放将会如此的彻底深远，相较之下，植物的开花绽放，无论是多么美丽，都将相形逊色。人类真的能够减低他们受到制约的心智的结构密度，变得像水晶或宝石般透明，让意识之光穿透吗？他们是否能够抗拒唯物主义和物质性如万有引力般的吸引，而超越对外在形相的认同？这种对外在形相的认同让人类的小我（ego）得以存活，并且将他们囚禁在自己性格的牢笼中。

The possibility of such a transformation has been the central message of the great wisdom teachings of humankind. The messengers Buddha, Jesus, and others, not all of them known were humanitys early flowers. They were precursors, rare and precious beings. A widespread flowering was not yet possible at that time, and their message became largely misunderstood and often greatly distorted. It certainly did not transform human behavior, except in a small minority of people.

这种转化的可能性，一直是人类所有伟大的智慧教导所传达的中心思想。那些使者——佛陀、耶稣以及其他不知名的大师，就是人类最早绽放的花朵。他们是先驱者，是稀有而珍贵的存在。在当时，意识的普遍绽放还是不太可能，而且他们所传达的讯息大部分都被误解，并经常被严重地扭曲。当然，除了少数的几个人之外，人类的行为也没有因此而转化。

Is humanity more ready now than at the time of those early teachers? Why should this be so? What can you do, if anything, to bring about or accelerate this inner shift? What is it that characterizes the old egoic state of consciousness, and by what signs is the new emerging consciousness recognized? These and other essential questions will be addressed in this book. More important, this book itself is a transformational device that has come out of the arising new consciousness. The ideas and concepts presented here may be important, but they are secondary. They are no more than signposts pointing toward awakening. As you read, a shift takes place within you.

现在的人类，是否比以前这些大师在世时准备得更充分了呢？为什么应该是这样呢？你到底能做什么，好让这个内在的转变发生或是加速发展呢？旧的小我意识状态的主要特点是什么？那些迹象可以用来辨识新萌生的意识呢？本书将会涉及这些问题以及其他重要的议题。更重要的是，这本书本身就是从正在扬升的新意识当中出现的转化工具。这里提出的论点和观念虽然重要，但它们其实都是次要的。它们只不过是指向觉醒的路标（signpost）。当你读这本书的时候，转变已经在你之内发生了。

This books main purpose is not to add new information or beliefs to your mind or to try to convince you of anything, but to bring about a shift in consciousness; that is to say, to awaken. In that sense, this book is not interesting. Interesting means you can keep your distance, play around with ideas and concepts in your mind, agree or disagree. This book is about you. It will change your state of consciousness or it will be meaningless. It can only awaken those who are ready. Not everyone is ready yet, but many are, and with each person who awakens, the momentum in the collective consciousness grows, and it becomes easier for others. If you dont know what awakening means, read on. Only by awakening can you know the true meaning of that word. A glimpse is enough to initiate the awakening process, which is irreversible. For some, that glimpse will come while reading this book. For many others who may not even have realized it, the process has already begun. This book will help them recognize it. For some, it may have begun through loss or suffering; for others, through coming into contact with a spiritual teacher or teaching, through reading The Power of Now or some other spiritually alive and therefore transformational book or any combination of the above. If the awakening process has begun in you , the reading of this book will accelerate and intensify it.

本书的主要目的，不是为你的心智再增加一些新的资讯或信念，或是试图说服你相信什么，它是为了要带来意识的转化，也就是：觉醒。就这点来说，这本书并不“有趣”。所谓“有趣”是指：你可以和它保持一定的距离，在心智里玩弄这些观点和概念，不管你同意或不同意。这本书是关于你的。它不是会改变你的意识状态，就是会对你而言毫无意义。它只会唤醒那些已经准备好的人。很多人（但不是每个人）都准备好了，而且随着更多个人觉醒的发生，集体意识的动能也会跟着增加，所以对其他人来说，觉醒就变得更加容易。如果你不知道“觉醒”是什么意思，请继续读下去。只有当你觉醒时，你才可能了解这个词的真意。短暂的一瞥就足以启动觉醒的过程，而且这个过程是不可逆转的。对有些人来说，那个短暂的一瞥会在阅读本书的时候发生。而对很多甚至不了解觉醒是什么的人来说，这个过程可能已经开始了。这本书可以帮助他们觉察到这一点。觉醒的过程，在某些人身上，可能经由遭受损失或痛苦的方式开始，有些人则可能是经由接触到某位灵性老师或是某些灵性教导开始，或是经由阅读《当下的力量》或其他充满灵性生命力因而具有转化力量的书籍，也有可能是以上各种经验的组合。如果觉醒过程已经在你之内展开了，阅读这本书将会加速并强化这个过程。

An essential part of the awakening is the recognition of the unawakened you, the ego as it thinks, speaks and acts, as well as the recognition of the collectively conditioned mental processes that perpetuate the unawakened state. That is why this book shows the main aspects of the ego and how they operate in the individual as well as in the collective. This is important for two related reasons: The first is that unless you know the basic mechanics behind the workings of the ego, you wont recognize it, and it will trick you into identifying with it again and again. This means it takes you over, an impostor pretending to be you. The second reason is that the act of recognition itself is one of the ways in which awakening happens. When you recognize the unconsciousness in you, that which makes the recognition possible is the arising consciousness, is awakening. You cannot fight against the ego and win, just as you cannot fight against darkness. The light of consciousness is all that is necessary. You are that light.

所谓觉醒，很重要的一部分就是去辨识出那个未觉醒的你——也就是小我，在小我思考、说话和行动的时候，辨识到它，并且辨认出那个集体受到制约的心智运作过程（它在未觉醒状态中持久不衰）。因此，本书揭示了小我的几个主要面向,以及它在个人层面和集体层面的运作方式。这也是为了两个重要而且相关的理由：第一就是，除非知道小我背后运作的基本机制，否则你无法辨识出它，而它会一直欺骗你，让你一而再、再而三地与它认同。也就是说，它会掌控你，冒名顶替而成为你。第二个理由是：“辨识出小我”的这个举动，正是觉醒发生的方式之一。当辨识出自己内在的无意识时，其实就是扬升的意识，也就是觉醒，让这个辨识发生的。你无法与小我抗争并且取得胜利，就如同你无法与黑暗抗争一样。你所需要的就是意识之光。你就是光。

## Our Inherited Dysfunction

If we look more deeply into humanitys ancient religions and spiritual traditions, we will find that underneath the many surface differences there are two core insights that most of them agree on. The words they use to describe those insights differ, yet they all point to a twofold fundamental truth. The first part of this truth is the realization that the normal state of mind of most human beings contains a strong element of what we might call dysfunction or even madness. Certain teachings at the heart of Hinduism perhaps come closest to seeing this dysfunction as a form of collective mental illness. They call it maya, the veil of delusion. Ramana Maharshi, one of the greatest Indian sages, bluntly states: The mind is maya.

若更加深入地去研究人类古老的宗教和灵性传统，我们就会发现，在众多的表面差异之下，有两个相同的核心洞见。描述这些洞见时所用的字句可能不尽相同，但是它们都指向一个双重含义的基本真理。这个真理的第一层含义就是：领悟到大多数人类所谓“正常”的心智状态，其实隐含了一个我们可以称之为“失调”甚至是“疯狂”的重要元素。一些印度教的核心教导也许最能够认清这种“失调”，其实是一种集体心智的疾病。他们称它为“玛雅”（maya），即幻相之幕。印度最伟大的圣者之一马哈希尊者（Ramana Maharshi），就曾经直率地指出：我们的心智（mind）就是幻相（maya）。

Buddhism uses different terms. According to the Buddha, the human mind in its normal state generates dukkha, which can be translated as suffering, unsatisfactoriness, or just plain misery. He sees it as a characteristic of the human condition. Wherever you go, whatever you do, says the Buddha, you will encounter dukkha, and it will manifest in every situation sooner or later.

佛教则使用不同的词汇。根据佛陀的说法，在正常的情况下，人类的心智会产生“度卡”（dukkha），可以翻译成受苦、不满足，或就是悲惨。佛陀视它为人类状态的一个特征。无论去哪里，无论做什么，佛陀说，你都会遭逢“度卡”，而且它迟早都会在每一个情境中出现。

According to Christian teachings, the normal collective state of humanity is one of original sin. Sin is a word that has been greatly misunderstood and misinterpreted. Literally translated from the ancient Greek in which the New Testament was written, to sin means to miss the mark, as an archer who misses the target, so to sin means to miss the point of human existence. It means to live unskillfully, blindly, and thus to suffer and cause suffering. Again, the term, stripped of its cultural baggage and misinterpretations, points to the dysfunction inherent in the human condition.

根据基督教的教导，人类共同的正常状态之一就是原罪。“罪”是一个被广泛误解和错误阐释的字。这个字是从《圣经·新约》的古希腊文直接翻译过来的。“犯罪”的原意是“错过了标记”，就像弓箭手错失标靶一样，所以“犯罪”就是“错失了人类存在的要义”。它的意思就是：活得不够有技巧，盲目地生活，因此就会受苦并制造苦因。所以，抛开文化上的包袱和错误诠释之后，“罪”这个字所指的，就是人类世袭下来的功能失调状况。

The achievements of humanity are impressive and undeniable. We have created sublime works of music, literature, painting, architecture, and sculpture. More recently, science and technology have brought about radical changes in the way we live and have enabled us to do and create things that would have been considered miraculous even two hundred years ago. No doubt: The human mind is highly intelligent. Yet its very intelligence is tainted by madness. Science and technology have magnified the destructive impact that the dysfunction of the human mind has upon the planet, other life?forms, and upon humans themselves. That is why the history of the twentieth century is where that dysfunction, that collective insanity, can be most clearly recognized. A further factor is that this dysfunction is actually intensifying and accelerating.

人类的成就是非凡而且无可否认的。我们在音乐、文学、绘画、建筑和雕塑方面都创造了杰出的作品。近年来，科技更为我们生活的方式带来剧烈的转变，同时使得我们能够做出和创造出两百年前会被视为奇迹的事情。毫无疑问，人类是非常有聪明才智的。但是它的聪明才智却因疯狂而有瑕疵。科技加强了人类心智破坏的影响力：这个星球、其他生命的形式以及人类自己，都深受其功能失调之害。这就是为什么在20世纪的历史中，我们最能够清楚地辨识出人类的功能失调和集体疯狂。另一个让我们能够清楚地辨识它们的原因就是：这个功能失调实际上正在加强和加速发展当中。

The First World War broke out in 1914. Destructive and cruel wars, motivated by fear, greed, and the desire for power, had been common occurrences throughout human history, as had slavery, torture, and widespread violence inflicted for religious and ideological reasons. Humans suffered more at the hands of each other than through natural disasters. By the year 1914, however, the highly intelligent human mind had invented not only the internal combustion engine, but also bombs, machine guns, submarines, flame throwers, and poison gas. Intelligence in the service of madness! In static trench warfare in France and Belgium, millions of men perished to gain a few miles of mud. When the war was over in 1918, the survivors look in horror and incomprehension upon the devastation left behind: ten million human beings killed and many more maimed or disfigured. Never before had human madness been so destructive in its effect, so clearly visible. Little did they know that this was only the beginning.

第一次世界大战在1914年爆发。在人类的历史上，经常发生由恐惧、贪婪和权力欲望所驱动的毁灭性残酷战争，以及奴役、虐待，还有因为宗教和意识形态不同而引发的各种暴力。人类因为相残而遭受的痛苦远超过因自然灾害所带来的痛苦。在1914年时，高度智慧的人类心智不但已经发明了内燃机，也发明了炸弹、机关枪、潜水艇、喷火器还有毒气瓦斯。聪明才智竟为疯狂所用！在法国和比利时的壕沟拉锯战当中，因为抢夺几英里的泥巴地而导致好几百万人的死亡。当1918年第一次世界大战结束时，幸存者在震惊和不解中检视战争遗留下来的惨祸：1000万人失去生命，更多的人伤残。人类的疯狂从未有如此巨大而且清晰可见的破坏力。然而当时的人却还不知道，这只是一个开始而已。

By the end of the century, the number of people who died a violent death at the hand of their fellow humans would rise to more than one hundred million. They died not only through wars between nations, but also through mass exterminations and genocide, such as the murder of twenty million class enemies, spies, and traitors in the Soviet Union under Stalin or the unspeakable horrors of the Holocaust in Nazi Germany. They also died in countless smaller internal conflicts, such as the Spanish civil war or during the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia when a quarter of that countrys population was murdered.

到了20世纪末，人类因同胞暴力相残而死亡的人数已经超过了1亿人。这些人不仅是因为国家之间的战争而死的，同时也死于大屠杀和种族灭绝。像苏联斯大林时代，死于“阶级敌人、间谍、叛国贼”罪名的人数高达两千万人。还有无法言喻其恐怖的纳粹德国大屠杀。另外还有很多人是死于无数小规模的内战，例如西班牙的内战；或是在红色高棉政权统治下的柬埔寨，全国约四分之一的人口都被处死。

We only need to watch the daily news on television to realize that the madness has not abated, that is continuing into the twenty?first century. Another aspect of the collective dysfunction of the human mind is the unprecedented violence that humans are inflicting on other life?forms and the planet itself the destruction of oxygen?producing forests and other plant and animal life; ill?treatment of animals in factory farms; and poisoning of rivers, oceans, and air. Driven by greed, ignorant of their connectedness to the whole, humans persist in behavior that, if continued unchecked, can only result in their own destruction.

我们只要每天收看电视新闻，就会知道这种疯狂不但丝毫没有减少，而且继续延伸到了21世纪。人类集体心智的功能失调，呈现在另外一个层面就是，人类对其他生命形式以及这个星球本身，展开了前所未有的暴力行为：供应氧气的热带雨林以及其他动植物都遭到破坏，养殖农场中对动物的虐待，河流、海洋和空气的污染。人类为贪婪所驱使而持续进行这样的行为，对他们自己是和整个地球生命联结在一起的事实一无所知。如果不加以检视的话，最终将会造成人类自身的毁灭。

The collective manifestations of the insanity that lies at the heart of the human condition constitute the greater part of human history. It is to a large extent a history of madness. If the history of humanity were the clinical case history of a single human being, the diagnosis would have to be: chronic paranoid delusions, a pathological propensity to commit murder and acts of extreme violence and cruelty against his perceived enemies his own unconsciousness projected outward. Criminally insane, with a few brief lucid intervals.

人类这种病态的集体显化就是人类的核心状态，构成了人类历史的主要部分，也是相当程度的疯狂史。如果人类的历史，可以用一个人的病历来比喻的话，那诊断将会是：慢性偏执狂妄想症，症状是有谋杀、极端暴力和残酷行为的病态癖好。对象则是他所认为的“敌人”——他自己的无意识向外投射出来的敌人。他是一个有犯罪倾向的疯子，但偶尔会有短暂的清醒时刻。

Fear, greed, and the desire for power are the psychological motivating forces not only behind warfare and violence between nations, tribes, religions, and ideologies, but also the cause of incessant conflict in personal relationships. They bring about a distortion in your perception of other people and yourself. Through them, you misinterpret every situation, leading to misguided action designed to rid you of fear and satisfy your need for more, a bottomless hole that can never be filled.

恐惧、贪婪和权力欲望这几个主要的心理动力，不仅是国家、种族、宗教和意识形态之间战争和暴力的原因，也是造成各种人际关系冲突不断的主因。它们也造成了你对于其他人和对你自己认知上的扭曲。在这样的错误认知下，你会曲解所有的情况，而采取一些让自己脱离恐惧或满足自己贪婪欲望的偏差行为，然而这却是一个永远都填不满的无底洞。

It is important to realize, however, that fear, greed, and the desire for power are not the dysfunction that we are speaking of but are themselves created by the dysfunction which is a deep?seated collective delusion that lies within the mind of each human being. A number of spiritual teachings tell us to let go of fear and desire. But those spiritual practices are usually unsuccessful. They havent gone to the root of the dysfunction. Fear, greed, and desire for power are not the ultimate causal factors. Trying to become a good or better human being sounds like a commendable and high?minded thing to do, yet it is an endeavor you cannot ultimately succeed in unless there is a shift in consciousness. This is because it is still part of the same dysfunction, a more subtle and rarefied form of self?enhancement, of desire for more and a strengthening of ones conceptual identity, ones self?image. You do not become good by trying to be good, but by finding the goodness that is already within you, and allowing that goodness to emerge. But it can only emerge if something fundamental changes in your state of consciousness.

我们必须了解的一个重点是，恐惧、贪婪和权力欲望并非我们所谈的功能失调，它们是因为功能失调而造成的，而功能失调则是深植于每一个人心智中的那个集体幻相。很多灵性教导告诉我们要放下恐惧和欲望，但是这些灵修法门通常都不管用，因为它们没有针对功能失调的根本原因着手。恐惧、贪婪和权力欲望不是最终的肇因。试着成为一个善良或是更好的人听起来是一个值得赞赏而高度“心智化”的事情。然而，除非你能转变你的意识状态，否则这样的努力终究不会成功。因为这样的努力仍旧是功能失调的一部分。这种努力可以视为是一种更微妙、更细腻的伪装形式，这个伪装其实是为了增强自我、欲求更多以及强化个人自我概念的认同（亦即自我形象）。试着变成好人并不会让你变得更好，而是经由找到那个早已存在于你之内的良善，并且允许那个良善彰显出来，才会让你变得更好。但是如果想要那个良善显现，你的意识状态必须有一个根本的改变。

The history of Communism, originally inspired by noble ideals, clearly illustrates what happens when people attempt to change external reality create a new earth without any prior change in their inner reality, their state of consciousness. They make plans without taking into account the blueprint for dysfunction that every human being carries within: the ego.

共产主义的历史，最早是由一个高贵的理想所启发的，但它清楚地展示了当人们试着去改变外在实相（reality）——创造一个新世界——而不先去改变内在实相（意识状态）的时候，会发生什么事情。他们在勾画未来的时候，并未考虑到人类功能失调的蓝图——也就是每个人内在都有的小我！

## The Arising New Consciousness

大多数古代的宗教和灵性传统都有一个共同的洞见：我们人类心智的正常状态，被一个基本的瑕疵给破坏了。然而，如果我们从这个洞见来看人类状态的本质（我们可以称它为坏消息），就会升起第二个洞见（好消息）：人类意识可能会有彻底转化的机会。在印度教的教导中（有时在佛教中也是），这个转化被称为“开悟”。在耶稣的教诲中，它是“救赎”，在佛教中，它是“了苦”。“解脱”和“觉醒”也是其他常用来形容这个转化的词汇。

人类最伟大的成就倒还不是艺术、科学或科技的成果，而是能认识到自身的功能失调与疯狂。在遥远的过去，已经有少数几个人能够这样认识到了。2600年前的印度，有一个名叫乔达摩·悉达多的人，他可能是第一个完全看清楚人类功能失调的人。后来，他被授予“佛陀”的尊号。佛陀的意思就是“觉醒者”。大约同时，在中国也出现了一位在人类之中较早觉醒的老师，他的名字是老子。他留下了一本有关他教导的著作《道德经》，这本书是有史以来意义最为深远的灵性书籍之一。

当然，当一个人能够认识自己的疯狂时，就已经是迈向神智清醒以及疗愈和超越（transcendence）的开始了。一个新的意识向度（dimension）已经开始在地球上显现，也可以说是第一个短暂的绽放。这些稀有的觉醒者，那个时候就和他们同时代的人开始谈论这些东西。他们谈到罪，谈到受苦和幻相。他们说：“看看你是如何生活的，看看你在做些什么，还有你创造出的痛苦。”然后他们会指出从“正常”人类存在的集体梦魇中苏醒的可能，他们指引了一条明路。

当时，虽然这个世界还没有准备好，这些大师却还是人类觉醒的过程当中，一个重要且不可或缺的部分。不可避免的，他们大部分都被同时代的人误解，甚至后世也有很多人无法理解他们。虽然他们的教导既简单又有力，而且有些还是他们弟子记录下来的，但还是经常被扭曲和误解。几百年来，很多和原来教导毫无关系的东西都被添加上去，反映出那些基本的误解。这些老师们，有的被嘲笑、辱骂或是被杀害，有的则像神一般地被崇拜。很多指引我们超越人类心智功能失调以及脱离集体病态方法的教导，都已经被扭曲，甚至本身也成为病态的一部分了。

因此，大致说来，很多宗教变成了制造分裂而不是促成合一的力量。它们不但没有经由领悟到所有生命最终的合一真相而终止暴力和仇恨，反而还带来更多的暴力和仇恨。在人与人之间以及不同的宗教，甚至相同的宗教之间，都制造了更多的分裂。它们成为一种人们可以认同的意识形态和信念系统，并且利用这些来增加人们虚幻的自我感。经由这些意识形态和信念系统，人们能够宣称自己是“对”的，别人是“错”的，同时借由他们的敌人（也就是其他人，不信仰他们宗教的人，或是错误信仰的人）来定义自己，甚至还常以此来为他们的杀戮行为辩解。人以自己的形象来创造神。那个永恒的、无限的、无以名之的存在，被人们矮化成一个你必须相信和崇拜为“我的神”或是“我们的神”的心理偶像。

但是……但是……即使有那么多疯狂的行径假宗教之名横行，这些宗教所指向的最终真理还是在它们的核心中闪耀。经过一层又一层的扭曲和误解，这些真理虽然很微弱，但仍然在闪耀着。除非在自己之内能够先瞥见这个真理，否则你很难在这些宗教之中看到它。在整个历史中，总是有极少数的个人经历到意识的转变，因而在他们的内在领悟到了所有宗教所指向的东西。为了描述那个无法用概念形容的真理，他们还是必须要运用自己宗教中概念的架构来描述它。

借由这样的一些人，在所有主要的宗教当中，兴起了一些学派或运动。这不仅代表原始教导的复苏，其中有些学派或运动也强化了原始教导的光芒。这就是灵知主义（Gnosticism）和一些神秘学派在基督教早期和中期兴起的背景。还有像伊斯兰教的苏菲教派（Sufism），犹太教的哈西德主义（Hasidism）和卡巴拉神秘哲学（Kabbala），印度教的不二论（Advaita Vedanta），佛教的禅宗和大圆满（Dzogchen）。这些学派大部分都是打破偶像崇拜的。它们去除了一层层僵硬的概念化和心理信念的结构，而正因为如此，那些早已完善的宗教统治阶级对它们抱持怀疑甚至敌对的态度。和主流宗教不同的是，这些教导强调领悟和内在的转化。

经由这些秘传的学派或运动，那些主要的宗教才能够重新获得它们原始教导的转化力量，即使在多数情况下，只有少数人才能接触这些学派或运动。而这些有幸接触到的人，由于为数不多，始终未能对大多数人的深层集体无意识造成任何显著的影响。随着时代的变迁，这些学派中，有些本身也变得过于形式化或概念化，以至于无法维持它们原来的影响力了。

## Spirituality and Religion

What is the role of the established religions in the arising of the new consciousness? Many people are already aware of the difference between spirituality and religion. They realize that having a belief system? a set of thoughts that you regard as the absolute truth does not make you spiritual no matter what the nature of those beliefs is. In fact, the more you make your thoughts (beliefs) into your identity, the more cut off you are from the spiritual dimension within yourself. Many religious people are stuck at that level. They equate truth with thought, and as they are completely identified with thought (their mind), they claim to be in sole possession of the truth in a n unconscious attempt to protect their identity. They dont realize the limitations of thought. Unless you believe (think) exactly as they do, you are wrong in their eyes, and in the not-too-distant past, they would have felt justified in killing you for that. And some still do, even now.

在新意识的扬升中，传统的宗教究竟扮演着什么样的角色呢？很多人已经觉知到灵性和宗教的差异。他们了解到，拥有一个信仰系统——一套你认为是绝对真理的思想——无论它们的本质是什么，并不会让你更有灵性。事实上，愈是与思想（信仰）认同的人，愈会把自己带离内在的灵性向度。很多虔诚信教的人都被困在这一个层次。他们将思想等同真理，而当他们完全与自己的思想（心智）认同时，他们就会宣称自己拥有唯一的真理，其实这是无意识地试图保护他们的身份认同。他们不了解思想的局限。除非你和他们所信（所想）的完全一样，否则你在他们眼中就是“错的”，而在不久的过去，他们还会觉得为此而杀了你是很合理的行为。其实，到现在还是有人这样做。

The new spirituality, the transformation of consciousness, is arising to a large extent outside of the structures of the existing institutionalized religions. There were always pockets of spirituality even in mind?dominated religions, although the institutionalized hierarchies felt threatened by them and often tried to suppress them. A large?scale opening of spirituality outside of the religious structures is an entirely new development. In the past, this would have been inconceivable, especially in the West, the most mind-dominated of all cultures, where the Christian church had a virtual franchise on spirituality. You couldnt just stand up and give a spiritual talk or publish a spiritual book unless you were sanctioned by the church, and if you were not, they would quickly silence you. But now, even within certain churches and religions, there are signs of change. It is heartwarming, and one is grateful for even the slightest signs of openness, such as Pope John Paul II visiting a mosque as well as a synagogue.

新的灵性，也就是意识的转化，现在正大幅度地在现有制度化的宗教结构外兴起。即使在心智挂帅的宗教当中，总有一些潜藏的灵性在其中，而制度化的宗教统治阶级会觉得备受威胁而试图打压它们。在宗教结构之外，大规模的灵性开展是一个全新的发展。在过去，这是不可思议的，尤其在西方（最为心智挂帅的文化），基督教会基本上是拥有灵性特权的。除非有教会的许可，否则你不能随意地对灵性发表言论或是出版有关灵性的书籍。如果没有教会的许可而你这样做的话，他们会马上让你销声匿迹。但是现在，即使在某些教会和宗教中，都有了转变的迹象。即使这些宗教开放的迹象还是很微弱，但已经让人很感恩了，例如教皇若望·保禄二世会去探访一座清真寺，还有犹太人的教会，这都是相当令人窝心的。

Partly as a result of the spiritual teachings that have arisen outside the established religions, but also due to an influx of the ancient Eastern wisdom teachings, a growing number of followers of traditional religions are able to let go of identification with form, dogma, and rigid belief systems and discover the original depth that is hidden within their own spiritual tradition at the same time as they discover the depth within themselves. They realize that how spiritual you are has nothing to do with what you believe but everything to do with your state of consciousness. This, in turn, determines how you act in the world and interact with others.

也许是因为在传统宗教之外兴起了一些灵性教导，同时也可能是因为东方古老的智慧教导蜂拥而至，愈来愈多传统宗教的跟随者能够放下对外在形式、教条和严苛信念系统的认同，而去发掘隐藏在他们自己的灵性传统中的原有深度，同时也发掘了他们自己内在的深度。他们了解到：你的灵性程度和你所相信的东西无关，但是却与你的意识状态息息相关。而接下来这又决定了你在这个世界中的行为以及与其他人之间的互动。

Those unable to look beyond form become even more deeply entrenched in their beliefs, that is to say, in their mind. We are witnessing not only an unprecedented influx of consciousness at this time but also an entrenchment and intensification of the ego. Some religious institutions will be open to the new consciousness; others will harden their doctrinal positions and become part of all those other man?made structures through which the collective ego will defend itself and fight back. Some churches, sects, cults, or religious movements are basically collective egoic entities, as rigidly identified with their mental positions as the followers of any political ideology that is closed to any alternative interpretation of reality.

那些执著于外在形相的人，会更加的深陷于他们的信念之中，也就是他们的心智之中。此刻我们目睹的不仅是一个前所未有的、蜂拥而至的意识潮流，同时也目睹了小我的困窘和强化。有些宗教团体会敞开胸怀接纳这个新的意识，有些反而会强化他们的教条立场，并且与其他人为的结构组织携手，让集体小我经由这些组织来防卫自己，并且反击这个潮流。有些教会、宗派、教派或是宗教运动基本上都是集体小我的实体，就像那些追随政治意识形态的人一样，严格而僵化地认同他们的心理立场，不能接受别人对现实不同的诠释。

But the ego is destined to dissolve, and all its ossified structures, whether they be religious or other institutions, corporations, or governments, will disintegrate from within, no matter how deeply entrenched they appear to be. The most rigid structures, the most impervious to change, will collapse first. This has already happened in the case of Soviet Communism. How deeply entrenched, how solid and monolithic it appeared, and yet within a few years, it disintegrated from within. No one foresaw this. All were taken by surprise. There are many more such surprises in store for us.

但是小我和它所有僵化的结构——无论是宗教、其他组织、公司或是政府，是注定要瓦解的，无论表面上看来是如何的根深蒂固，它们都会从内部开始分崩离析。最严谨的结构组织，最冥顽不灵而无法改变的，反而会第一个崩溃。

## The Urgency of Transformation

When faced with a radical crisis, when the old way of being in the world, of interacting with each other and with the realm of nature doesnt work anymore, when survival is threatened by seemingly insurmountable problems, an individual life?form or a species will either die or become extinct or rise above the limitations of its condition through an evolutionary leap.

It is believed that the life-forms on this planet first evolved in the sea. When there were no animals yet to be found on land, the sea was already teeming with life. Then at some point, one of the sea creatures must have started to venture onto dry land. It would perhaps crawl a few inches at first, then exhausted by the enormous gravitational pull of the planet, it would return to the water, where gravity is almost nonexistent and where it could live with much greater ease. And then it tried again and again and again, and much later would adapt to life on land, grow feet instead of fins, develop lungs instead of gills. It seems unlikely that a species would venture into such an alien environment and undergo an evolutionary transformation unless it was compelled to do so by some crisis situation. There may have been a large sea area that got cut off from the main ocean where the water gradually receded over thousands of years, forcing fish to leave their habitat and evolve.

Responding to a radical crisis that threatens our very survival this is humanitys challenge now. The dysfunction of the egoic human mind, recognized already more than 2,500 years ago by the ancient wisdom teachers and now magnified through science and technology, is for the first time threatening the survival of the planet. Until very recently, the transformation of human consciousness also pointed to by the ancient teachers was no more than a possibility, realized by a few rare individuals here and there, irrespective of cultural or religious background. A widespread flowering of human consciousness did not happen because it was not yet imperative.

A significant portion of the earths population will soon recognize, if they havent already done so, that humanity is now faced with a stark choice: Evolve or die. A still relatively small but rapidly growing percentage of humanity is already experiencing within themselves the breakup of the old egoic mind patterns and the emergence of a new dimension of consciousness.

What is arising now is not a new belief system, a new religion, spiritual ideology, or mythology. We are coming to the end not only of mythologies but also of ideologies and belief systems. The change goes deeper than the content of your mind, deeper than your thoughts. In fact, at the heart of the new consciousness is the transcendence of thought, the newfound ability of rising above thought, of realizing a dimension within yourself that is infinitely more vast than thought. You then no longer derive your identity, your sense of who you are, from the incessant stream of thinking that in the old consciousness you take to be yourself. What a liberation to realize that the voice in my head is not who I am. Who am I then? The one who sees that. The awareness that is prior to thought, the space in which the thought or the emotion or sense perception happens.

Ego is no more than this: identification with form, which primarily means thought forms. If evil has any reality and it has a relative, not an absolute, reality this is also its definition: complete identification with form physical forms, thought forms, emotional forms. This results in a total unawareness of my connectedness with the whole, my intrinsic oneness with every other as well as with the Source. This forgetfulness is original sin, suffering, delusion. When this delusion of utter separateness underlies and governs whatever I think, say, and do, what kind of world do I create? To find the answer to this, observe how humans relate to each other, read a history book, or watch the news on television tonight.

小我只不过是：与外在形相的认同，形相主要指的是思想形相（念相，thoughtform）。如果邪恶有任何真实性的话（这个真实性是相对的，不是绝对的），那么它的定义也可以是：完全地与外在形相认同，就是与物质形相、思想形相、情绪形相认同。这样的认同会造成我们的无知：无视于我们与整体的联结，完全无法觉察到我们内在与其他万物以及源头的合一。这样的遗忘就是原罪，受苦和幻相。当“我们与万物显然是分离的”这个幻相主导了我所想、所说和所做的所有事物的时候，我会创造出什么样的世界？想找到答案的话，你就去观察人类是如何互动的：读一本历史书，或是看一下今晚的电视新闻，你就知道了。

If the structures of the human mind remain unchanged, we will always end up recreating fundamentally the same world, the same evils, the same dysfunction.

如果人类的心智结构还是不改变的话，我们会不断地重新创造出本质上如出一辙的世界，同样的邪恶，同样的功能失调。

## A New Heaven and a New Earth

The inspiration for the title of this book came from a Bible prophecy that seems more applicable now than at any other time in human history. It occurs in both the Old and the New Testament and speaks of the collapse of the existing world order and the arising of a new heaven and a new earth. We need to understand here that heaven is not a location but refers to the inner realm of consciousness. This is the esoteric meaning of the word, and this is also its meaning in the teachings of Jesus. Earth, on the other hand, is the outer manifestation in form, which is always a reflection of the inner. Collective human consciousness and life on our planet are intrinsically connected. A new heaven is the emergence of a transformed state of human consciousness, and a new earth is its reflection in the physical realm. Since human life and human consciousness are intrinsically one with the life of the planet, as the old consciousness dissolves, there are bound to be synchronistic geographic and climatic natural upheavals in many parts of the planet, some of which we are already witnessing now.

本书的书名来自于《圣经》中一个预言的启发，这个预言在当前时刻，比人类历史上任何一个时期都更适用。在《新约》和《旧约》当中都谈到，一个现有世界秩序的崩溃以及一个“新天新地”的升起。我们必须要了解的是：在这里说的“天”（天堂），并不是一个地点，它指的是意识的内在领域，它的意义是灵性而隐秘的（不是字面上的意思），这也是耶稣教诲的要义。从另一方面来说，“地”（世界）就是形相的外在显化，而外在形相永远都是内在的反映。在我们这个星球上，人类集体意识和生命是根本相连的。“一个新天堂”指的是已转化了的人类意识的出现。“一个新世界”指的是这个意识在物质领域的反映。既然人类生命和意识与地球的生命是根本合一的，随着旧意识的瓦解，在同一时间，地球各地会同步发生地理上和气候上的自然混乱，有些我们现在已经目睹到了。
