# Ch1 YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND

## THE GREATEST OBSTACLE TO ENLIGHTENMENT

> Enlightenment what is that?

> 开悟（enlightenment）是什么？

A beggar had been sitting by the side of a road for over thirty years. One day a stranger walked by. “Spare[^1] some change?” mumbled the beggar, mechanically holding out his old baseball cap. “I have nothing to give you,” said the stranger. Then he asked: “What's that you are sitting on? ” “ Nothing,” replied the beggar. “Just an old box. I have been sitting on it for as long as I can remember. ” “ Ever looked inside?” asked the stranger. “No,” said the beggar. “Whats the point? There's nothing in there.” “Have a look inside,” insisted the stranger. The beggar managed to pry[^2] open the lid[^3]. With astonishment, disbelief, and elation[^4], he saw that the box was filled with gold.

曾经，有个乞丐在路边坐了30多年。一天，一位陌生人经过。这个乞丐机械地举起他的旧棒球帽，喃喃地说：“给点儿吧。”陌生人说：“我没有什么东西可以给你。”然后他问：“你坐着的是什么？”乞丐回答说：“什么都没有，只是一个旧箱子而已，自从我有记忆以来，我就一直坐在它上面。”陌生人问：“你曾经打开过箱子吗？”“没有。”乞丐说，“有什么用？里面什么都没有。”陌生人坚持：“打开箱子看一看。”乞丐这才试着打开箱子。这时令人意想不到的事情发生了，乞丐充满了惊奇与狂喜：箱子里装满了金子。

I am that stranger who has nothing to give you and who is telling you to look inside. Not inside any box, as in the parable[^5], but somewhere even closer, inside yourself.

我就是那位没有任何东西可给你，却要求你打开箱子看看的陌生人。我不是让你像这则寓言里的乞丐一样看什么箱子，而是叫你往一个更贴近你自身的地方看：你的内在。

“But I am not a beggar,” I can hear you say.

我能清晰地听到你说：“可是，我不是个乞丐呀。”

Those who have not found their true wealth, which is **the radiant[^6] joy of Being and the deep, unshakable peace** that comes with it, are beggars, even if they have great material wealth. They are looking outside for scraps[^7] of pleasure or fulfillment, for validation, security, or love, while they have a treasure within that not only includes all those things but is infinitely greater than anything the world can offer.

那些没有找到他们真正的财富，也就是本体的喜悦以及与它紧密联系在一起的、深刻而不可动摇的宁静的人，就是乞丐，即使他们有很多物质上的财富。他们四处寻找成就、安全感或爱情所残余的欢乐或满足，但是他们不知道自己不仅已经拥有了所有的这些东西，而且还拥有了比这些更为珍贵的东西。

The word enlightenment conjures[^8] up the idea of some superhuman accomplishment, and the ego likes to keep it that way, but it is simply your **natural state of felt oneness with Being**. It is a state of connectedness[^9] with something immeasurable and indestructible, something that, almost paradoxically, is **essentially you and yet is much greater than you**. It is **finding your true nature beyond name and form**. The inability to feel this connectedness gives rise to the **illusion of separation**, from yourself and from the world around you. You then perceive yourself, consciously or unconsciously, as an isolated fragment. Fear arises, and conflict within and without[^10] becomes the norm[^11].

“开悟”这个词听起来就像一些超人类成就的玄学，但是，它其实就是**一种简单的与本体合一的自然状态**。它是一种与不可衡量的、不可摧毁的事物相联系的状态。几乎矛盾的是，它其实就是你自己，但又比你更伟大。它找到了超越你名字和形象的真正本质。如果你不能感觉到这种联系，你就会有一种与自己以及与你周围的世界相分离的幻象。你会有意识或无意识地感到自己就像一个孤立的碎片。然后，你内外部的恐惧、冲突和矛盾也随之产生。

I love the Buddha's simple definition of enlightenment as “the end of suffering.” There is nothing superhuman in that, is there? Of course, as a definition, it is incomplete. It only tells you what enlightenment is not: no suffering. But what's left when there is no more suffering? The Buddha is silent on that, and his silence implies that you'll have to find out for yourself. He uses a negative definition so that the mind cannot make it into something to believe in or into a superhuman accomplishment, a goal that is impossible for you to attain. Despite this precaution[^12], the majority of Buddhists still believe that enlightenment is for the Buddha, not for them, at least not in this lifetime.

我喜欢佛陀将开悟简单地定义为“受苦的终结”（the end of suffering）。在这个定义里没有超人类观念的存在。当然，作为定义，它是不完整的。它仅告诉你开悟的否定性定义：受苦停止。但是，当没有受苦存在时，还剩下什么呢？佛陀对此沉默不语。他的沉默意味着你必须自己去寻找答案。他下了一个否定形式的定义，所以你不会认为开悟是一个超人类的成就或不可达到的目标。尽管这样，绝大部分佛教徒仍然没有体会佛陀的苦心，仍然相信开悟是为佛而准备的，而不属于他们，至少在此生中不属于他们。

> You used the word Being. Can you explain what you mean by that?
>
> 关于本体（being）这个词，你能解释一下它的含义吗？

Being is the **eternal, ever-present One Life beyond the myriad[^13] forms of life that are subject to birth and death**. However, Being is **not only beyond but also deep within every form as its innermost invisible and indestructible essence**. This means that it is accessible to you now as your own deepest self, your true nature. But don't seek to grasp it with your mind. Don't try to understand it. You can know it only when the mind is still. When you are present, when your attention is fully and intensely in the Now, Being can be felt, but it can never be understood mentally. To regain awareness of Being and to abide[^14] in that state of “feeling-realization” is enlightenment.

本体是超越那些受限于生死的各种生命形式而永在的“至一生命”。作为无形的、不灭的本质，本体不仅超越了所有生命形式，更深深地根植于每种生命形式之中。也就是说，作为你最深的自我和真实的本质，你可以在每个当下接触到它。别试着去掌握它的含义，别试着去理解它。只有当你的思维处于静止时，你才会领会它的真正含义。当你的思维处于静止时，当你的注意力完全集中在当下时刻时，你就会感觉到本体，但是从心智上我们永远无法理解它。重新觉知到本体，并保持这种觉知体验的状态就是开悟。

> When you say Being, are you talking about God? If you are, then why don't you say it?
>
> 你谈到的“本体”，是指上帝吗？如果是这样，为什么不直接说呢？

The word God has become empty of meaning through thousands of years of misuse. I use it sometimes, but I do so sparingly[^15]. By misuse, I mean that people who have never even glimpsed the realm of the sacred, the infinite vastness behind that word, use it with great conviction[^16], as if they knew what they are talking about. Or they argue against it, as if they knew what it is that they are denying. This misuse gives rise to absurd beliefs, assertions, and egoic delusions, such as “My or our God is the only true God, and your God is false,” or Nietzsche's famous statement “God is dead.”

经过上千年的滥用，“上帝”这个词的意义已经变得很空洞。我有时用“上帝”这个词，但极少这样做。这里的滥用指的是人们在从未理解这个词的真谛的基础上就自以为是地去运用它，像是很了解它的样子，或是极力地反对它，好像很清楚他们在反对的究竟是什么似的。这种滥用就引发了可笑的信仰、结论以及自大的幻象，比如：我的或我们的上帝是唯一的真正的上帝，而你们的上帝则是假的，或如尼采说的“上帝死了”。

The word God has become a closed concept. The moment the word is uttered, a mental image is created, no longer, perhaps, of an old man with a white beard, but still a mental representation of someone or something outside you, and, yes, almost inevitably a male someone or something.

“上帝”这个词已经成了一个封闭的概念。当人们说出这个词时，他们就会构想一个形象出来，也许不会是一位白胡子的老人，但是仍然还是一个置身于你之外的人或是物，同时不免是个男性或雄性的形象。

Neither God nor Being nor any other word can define or explain the ineffable[^17] reality behind the word, so the only important question is whether the word is a help or a hindrance[^18] in enabling you to experience That toward which it points. Does it point beyond itself to that transcendental[^19] reality, or does it lend itself too easily to becoming no more than an idea in your head that you believe in, a mental idol?

“本体”或“上帝”或其他任何文字都不能诠释这个词背后无法言传的意义，所以重要的是这个词对你体验你的内心是一个帮助还是一个障碍。它所指向的是超越它本身意义的先验的现实，还是它太易于理解，而成为人们的一种信念或一个偶像呢？

The word Being explains nothing, but nor does God. Being, however, has the advantage that it is an **open concept**. It does not reduce the infinite invisible to a finite entity. It is impossible to form a mental image of it. Nobody can claim exclusive possession of Being. It is your very essence, and it is immediately accessible to you as the feeling of your own presence, the realization 'I am' that is prior to 'I am this' or 'I am that'. So it is only a small step from the word Being to the experience of Being.

和上帝一样，“本体”这个词也没有解释任何东西。然而，本体是一个开放的概念，这是它的优势。它没有将一个无限的、无形的东西缩减成一个有限的实体。人们不可能在头脑中构想出一个关于本体的意象，也没有人能够宣称他独自拥有本体。它是你的本质，只有当你感觉到临在时，你才会立即领会到“我是”的真谛。所以从“本体”这个词到体验到你的“本体”，只是小小的一步而已。

> What is the greatest obstacle to experiencing this reality?

> 体验这种现实的最大障碍是什么？

**Identification with your mind, which causes thought to become compulsive**. Not to be able to stop thinking is a dreadful[^20] affliction[^21], but we don't realize this because almost everybody is suffering from it, so it is considered normal. This incessant[^22] mental noise prevents you from finding that realm of inner stillness[^23] that is inseparable from Being. It also creates a false mind-made self that casts a shadow of fear and suffering. We will look at all that in more detail later.

是认同于你的思维，它使人们进行强迫性的思考。不能停止思考是一个可怕的烦恼，由于几乎每一个人都遭受着此种痛苦，而我们又无法意识到这一点，所以这就成了一件很正常的事情。这种不停的思维活动使你无法达到内心的宁静状态。同时，它创造了一个虚假的自我，不断投射出恐惧和苦难的阴影。在下面的章节里我们将详细讨论这个话题。

The philosopher Descartes believed that he had found the most fundamental truth when he made his famous statement: “I think, therefore I am.” He had, in fact, given expression to the most basic error, to equate thinking with Being and identity with thinking. The compulsive thinker, which means almost everyone, lives in a state of apparent separateness, in an insanely complex world of continuous problems and conflict, a world that reflects the ever-increasing fragmentation of the mind. Enlightenment is a state of wholeness, of being “at one” and therefore at peace. At one with life in its manifested aspect, the world, as well as with your deepest self and life unmanifested at one with Being. Enlightenment is not only the end of suffering and of continuous conflict within and without, but also the end of the dreadful enslavement to incessant thinking. What an incredible liberation this is!

哲学家笛卡尔认为，在他写下名言“我思故我在”时，他已经找到了真理。实际上，他表达了一个最基本的错误：将思考视为存在并且认同于思考。强迫性思考者（其实几乎每个人都是）活在一个分裂的状态——一个充满了问题和冲突的疯狂而复杂的世界、一个反映了我们大脑越来越分裂的世界。开悟是一个圆满的境界，合一而和平，与生命以及它所显化的世界合一，同时，与你最深的自我的未显化的生命，也就是本体合一。开悟不仅是痛苦和身心内外冲突的终结，也是思考的终结，这将会是一次不可思议的解放！

Identification with your mind creates an opaque[^24] screen[^25] of concepts, labels, images, words, judgments, and definitions that blocks all true relationship. It comes between you and yourself, between you and your fellow man and woman, between you and nature, between you and God. It is this screen of thought that creates the illusion of separateness, the illusion that there is you and a totally separate “other.” You then forget the essential fact that, underneath the level of physical appearances and separate forms, you are one with all that is. By “forget,” I mean that you can no longer feel this oneness as self-evident reality. You may believe it to be true, but you no longer know it to be true. A belief may be comforting. Only through your own experience, however, does it become liberating.

思维认同创造了一连串的概念、标签、意象、词语、判断和定义，阻碍了你所有真正的关系。这些东西挡在你和你自己之间、你和其他人之间、你和自然之间、你和上帝之间。就是这些思维创造了一种孤立的幻象，你与其他人完全分离的幻象。因此，你忘却了一个基本的事实，那就是：在我们肉身表相看来是与众生分离的情形之下，你其实是与万物合一的。当我说“你忘却了”，我指的是你已经无法感受到“合一”这个不证自明的事实。也许你相信它是真的，但是你无法感觉到它是真的了。一个信念也许可以被遗忘，但是，你一定要亲身验证它，它才能真正地解放你自己。

Thinking has become a disease. Disease happens when things get out of balance. For example, there is nothing wrong with cells dividing and multiplying in the body, but when this process continues in disregard of the total organism, cells proliferate and we have disease.

思维已经变成了一种疾病。当事情失去平衡时，这种疾病就会发生。比如，体内的细胞分裂和繁殖本身没有任何错误，但是当这个过程不顾整个有机体而持续地快速增生时，我们就会得病了。

The mind is a superb instrument if used rightly. Used wrongly, however, it becomes very destructive. To put it more accurately, it is not so much that you use your mind wrongly you usually don't use it at all. It uses you. This is the disease. You believe that you are your mind. This is the delusion. The instrument has taken you over.

注意：如果思维被正确利用的话，它将是一个超强的工具；但如果利用不当，它的危害则相当大。准确地说，不是你利用思维的方式不对——基本上你根本没有利用它，而是它在利用你。这就是一种病态。你认为你就是你的思维、你的大脑，其实这只是种幻觉，这个工具已然控制了你。

> I don't quite agree. It is true that I do a lot of aimless thinking, like most people, but I can still choose to use my mind to get and accomplish things, and I do that all the time.
>
> 我不是很赞同你的说法。虽然像大多数人一样，我常常漫无目的地思考，但是我仍然利用我的大脑完成了许多事情，一直以来我都是这样做的。

Just because you can solve a crossword puzzle or build an atom bomb doesn't mean that you use your mind. Just as dogs love to chew bones, the mind loves to get its teeth into problems. Thats why it does crossword puzzles and builds atom bombs. You have no interest in either. Let me ask you this: can you be free of your mind whenever you want to? Have you found the “off” button?

你能解答一个填字谜语或制造一颗原子弹，并不能说明你利用了你的大脑。就像狗喜欢啃骨头一样，大脑喜欢思考问题。这就是为什么它要去玩填字游戏和制造原子弹的原因。你或许对这两个活动都不感兴趣，让我这样问你吧：无论何时，当你想从思维中解放出来的时候，你能做到吗？你找到了停止思考的那个按钮吗？

> You mean stop thinking altogether[^26]? No, I can't, except maybe for a moment[^27] or two.
>
> 你是说完全停止思考吗？不，我做不到，一两分钟或许还可以。

Then the mind is using you. You are unconsciously identified with it, so you don't even know that you are its slave. It's almost as if you were possessed[^28] without knowing it, and so you take the possessing entity to be yourself. The beginning of freedom is the realization that you are not the possessing entity the thinker. Knowing this enables you to observe the entity. The moment you start watching the thinker, a higher level of consciousness becomes activated. You then begin to realize that there is a **vast realm of intelligence beyond thought**, that **thought is only a tiny aspect of that intelligence**. You also realize that all the things that truly matter beauty, love, creativity, joy, inner peace arise from beyond the mind. You begin to awaken.

那么，就是你的大脑在利用你了。你无意识地认同了它，所以你甚至不知道自己是它的奴隶。这几乎就像你在毫不知情的情况下被它所俘虏，所以你认为思考问题的这个实体就是你自己。从思维中解放出来的开始就是认识到你不是一个思考问题的实体——思考者。认识到这一点能使你很好地观察这个思考者。在你观察这个思考者时，一个更高层次的意识就被激活了。然后，你会开始意识到有很大的一片超越思想的智性，思想只是这个智性的一个小方面。你同样还会认识到所有真正重要的事情，如美貌、爱情、创造力、欢乐、内在的宁静等，都来自大脑之外。你开始觉醒了。

## FREEING YOURSELF FROM YOUR MIND

> What exactly do you mean by “watching the thinker”?
>
> “观察思考者”的准确含义是什么？

When someone goes to the doctor and says, “I hear a voice in my head,” he or she will most likely be sent to a psychiatrist. The fact is that, in a very similar way, virtually everyone hears a voice, or several voices, in their head all the time: the involuntary[^29] thought processes that you don't realize you have the power to stop. Continuous monologues or dialogues. You have probably come across “mad” people in the street incessantly[^22] talking or muttering to themselves. Well, thats not much different from what you and all other “normal” people do, except that you don't do it out loud. The voice **comments, speculates, judges, compares, complains, likes, dislikes**, and so on. The voice isn't necessarily relevant to the situation you find yourself in at the time; it may be reviving the recent or distant past or rehearsing or imagining possible future situations. Here **it often imagines things going wrong and negative outcomes; this is called worry**. Sometimes this soundtrack is accompanied by visual images or “mental movies.” Even if the voice is relevant to the situation at hand, it will interpret it in terms of the past. This is because the voice belongs to your conditioned mind, which is the result of all your past history as well as of the collective cultural mind-set you inherited. So you see and judge the present through the eyes of the past and get a totally distorted view of it. It is not uncommon for the voice to be a person's own worst enemy. Many people live with a tormentor[^30] in their head that continuously attacks and punishes them and drains them of vital energy. It is the cause of untold[^31] misery and unhappiness, as well as of disease.

当某人去看病时说“在我的脑海里有一个声音”，他或她很可能就被送去精神病医院了。事实是，几乎每个人都会以相似的方式在他们的脑海中听到一种或几种声音：这就是所谓不自主的思考过程，你却没有意识到你有阻止这种独白或对话的力量。

在街道上，你可能会遇到不断喃喃自语的“疯子”。其实他的行为与你和其他“正常人”区别不大，只是你们没有大声说出来而已。那个声音不停地在评论、推测、批判、比较、抱怨、选择好恶等。这种声音可能与你当下所在的情况无关，它可能是关于过去或未来的一些事情，它可能是在回忆往昔，或是在幻想未来可能发生的事情。它经常想象事情可能会出差错，或产生不利的后果，这就是杞人忧天。有时这种声音还会伴随着一些视觉意象或“心理电影”。即使这种声音与现在的情况相关，它也会以过去的形式来解释它，这是因为声音属于你被制约了的大脑，它是你过去的经历以及你继承下来的集体文化思维模式的结果。所以，你以对过去的看法来判断现在的事情，一定会得到一个完全被歪曲的理解。这个声音是人类自己最大的敌人，这是毫不夸张的。许多人在大脑的折磨下度过一生，任由它攻击、惩罚，并耗尽生命的能量。这就是数不清的灾难、痛苦以及疾病产生的原因。

The good news is that you can free yourself from your mind. This is the only true liberation. You can take the first step right now. Start listening to the voice in your head as often as you can. Pay particular attention to any repetitive thought patterns, those old gramophone[^32] records that have been playing in your head perhaps for many years. This is what I mean by “watching the thinker,” which is another way of saying: listen to the voice in your head, be there as the witnessing presence.

好消息是你能从你的思维中解放出来。这是唯一的真正的解放。现在，你可以采取第一个步骤了——经常倾听你大脑中的声音。特别关注那些重复性的思维模式，那些多年来缠绕你的“旧唱片”。这就是我说的“观察思考者”的含义，换句话说：倾听你脑袋中的声音并作为一个观察者的临在。

When you listen to that voice, listen to it impartially[^33]. That is to say, do not judge. Do not judge or condemn what you hear, for doing so would mean that the same voice has come in again through the back door. You'll soon realize: there is the voice, and here I am listening to it, watching it. This I am realization, this sense of your own presence, is not a thought. It arises from beyond the mind.

当你在倾听那种声音时，不要去做任何评判。不要对你所听到的声音做出判断或进行谴责，因为这样做意味着同样的声音又会从后门乘虚而入。你将会很快地认识到：那里有一种声音，而我在这里倾听它，观察它。这是一种自我存在的感觉而不是思维。它超越了你的思维。

So when you listen to a thought, you are aware not only of the thought but also of yourself as the witness of the thought. A new dimension of consciousness has come in. As you listen to the thought, you feel a conscious presence your deeper self behind or underneath the thought, as it were. The thought then loses its power over you and quickly subsides[^34], because you are no longer energizing the mind through identification with it. This is the beginning of the end of involuntary and compulsive thinking.

所以当你在倾听思维时，你不仅意识到了这种思维，而且还意识到了你在观察这种思维。这样，一个新的意识层面就产生了。随着你倾听思维，你会感觉到在这种思维之下或之后的一种有意识的临在，那就是你更深的自我。于是，这种思维丧失了它的力量而且很快地消散，因为你不再通过对思维的认同而为其注入活力。这是不自主以及强迫性思维终结的开始。

When a thought subsides, you experience a **discontinuity in the mental stream a gap of “no-mind.”** At first, the gaps will be short, a few seconds perhaps, but gradually they will become longer. When these gaps occur, you feel a certain stillness and peace inside you. This is the beginning of your natural state of felt oneness with Being, which is usually obscured by the mind. With practice, the sense of stillness and peace will deepen. In fact, there is no end to its depth. You will also feel a subtle emanation[^35] of joy arising from deep within: the joy of Being.

当一种思维止息时，你会在自己的心智流（mental stream）中体验到一种思维的中断——思维空白。首先，这种空白是短暂的，或许仅几秒钟，但是渐渐地它们会变得长久些。当这种空白出现时，你在内心会感觉到一种静止和宁静的状态。于是，你开始感觉到与本体合二为一的自然状态，通常这种状态受到思维的蒙蔽而模糊，多加练习之后，你的这种平和与宁静的感觉会加深。实际上，这种深度是无止境的。你同样会感觉到一种来自你内心深处的喜悦。

It is not a trance-like[^36] state. Not at all. There is no loss of consciousness here. The opposite is the case. If the price of peace were a lowering of your consciousness, and the price of stillness a lack of vitality and alertness, then they would not be worth having. In this state of inner connectedness, you are much more alert, more awake than in the mind-identified state. You are fully present. It also raises the vibrational frequency of the energy field that gives life to the physical body.

这不是一种意识模糊的状态。一点儿都不是。在这里，意识不会丢失。恰恰相反，如果内心的平和是以意识水平的下降作为代价，如果获得宁静的代价是变得缺乏生命力与警觉性的话，那它们就不值得拥有。在这种内在的联结之中，你会比思维认同状态下更为警惕，更为清醒，更为临在。它同样会提升赋予你身体生命能量的振动频率。

As you go more deeply into this realm of **no-mind**, as it is sometimes called in the East, you realize the state of **pure consciousness**. In that state, you feel your own presence with such intensity and such joy that all thinking, all emotions, your physical body, as well as the whole external world become relatively insignificant in comparison to it. And yet **this is not a selfish but a selfless state**. It takes you beyond what you previously thought of as “your self.” That presence is essentially you and at the same time inconceivably[^37] greater than you. What I am trying to convey here may sound paradoxical or even contradictory, but there is no other way that I can express it.

随着你进一步深入这种“无念”的状态（东方人的说法），你会认识到一种纯意识状态。在这种状态下，你会如此喜悦地感受你的临在：所有的思维、情绪、身体以及整个外部世界，在与你的本体比较之下，都不那么重要了。然而这不是一种自我（selfish）的状态，而是一种无我（selfless）的状态。它超越了你原先认知的自己（yourself）。这种临在实际上就是你自己，但不可思议的是，它比你伟大。我在这里努力阐述的问题可能听起来荒谬甚至自相矛盾，但是我没有其他更好的表达方式了。

Instead of “watching the thinker,” you can also create a gap in the mind stream simply by directing the focus of your attention into the Now. Just become intensely conscious of the present moment. This is a deeply satisfying thing to do. In this way, you draw consciousness away from mind activity and create a gap of no-mind in which you are highly alert and aware but not thinking. This is the essence of meditation.

除了“观察思考者”之外，你还可以通过将你的注意力集中在当下这一刻，从而在思维中创造那种空白。就是全神贯注于当下的时刻。这是一件非常值得去做的事情。通过这种方式，你可以将意识从思维活动中引开，并创造一种无思维的空白。在这种空白中，你高度警惕，注意力高度集中，但是你没有在思考。这就是冥想的本质。

In your everyday life, you can practice this by taking any routine activity that normally is only a means to an end[^38] and giving it your fullest attention, so that it becomes an end in itself. For example, every time you walk up and down the stairs in your house or place of work, pay close attention to every step, every movement, even your breathing. Be totally present. Or when you wash your hands, pay attention to all the sense perceptions associated with the activity: the sound and feel of the water, the movement of your hands, the scent[^39] of the soap, and so on. Or when you get into your car, after you close the door, pause for a few seconds and observe the flow of your breath. Become aware of a silent but powerful sense of presence. There is one certain criterion by which you can measure your success in this practice: the degree of peace that you feel within.

在你的日常生活中，你可通过任何日常活动来练习这种方法。比如，每次你在家中或办公室上下楼梯时，你每一步、每一刻，甚至每一次呼吸时都全神贯注，完全集中你的注意力。或者当你洗手时，关注与洗手有关的所有感觉：水的声音和感觉、手的运动、肥皂的香味等。或者在你上车时，关闭车门后，停顿几秒钟并观察你的呼吸。觉察到那个宁静且强而有力的临在。有一个标准可以用来衡量你的练习是否成功：你内在所感觉到的平和的程度。

So the single most vital step on your journey toward enlightenment is this: learn to disidentify from your mind. Every time you create a gap in the stream of mind, the light of your consciousness grows stronger.

所以迈向开悟之途最为关键的一步是：从对思维的认同中摆脱出来。每次，当你在思维中创造空白时，你的意识就会变得更强。

One day you may catch yourself smiling at the voice in your head, as you would smile at the antics[^40] of a child. This means that you no longer take the content of your mind all that seriously, as your sense of self does not depend on it.

某天，你可能会发现你在冲着你大脑中的声音微笑，就像你冲着孩子调皮的动作微笑一样。这意味着你不再认真地对待你思维的内容，因为你的自我意识不再依赖于它。

## ENLIGHTENMENT: RISING ABOVE THOUGHT

> Isn't thinking essential in order to survive in this world?
>
> 难道思维对于我们在这个世界上的生存来说不是最为关键的吗？

Your mind is an instrument, a tool. It is there to be used for a specific task, and when the task is completed, you lay it down. As it is, I would say about 80 to 90 percent of most people's thinking is not only repetitive and useless, but because of its dysfunctional and often negative nature, much of it is also harmful. Observe your mind and you will find this to be true. It causes a serious leakage of vital energy.

你的大脑只是一个工具。它是被用来处理特殊任务的，当这个任务完成时，你就让它处于休止状态。因此可以说，人们80%~90%的思维不仅是重复的，而且是无用的，甚至由于思维的运作障碍和消极的本质，大部分思维都是有害的。如果你观察你的思维，你就会发现这是真的。这还导致了你生命能量的严重损耗。

This kind of compulsive thinking is actually an addiction. What characterizes an addiction? Quite simply this: you no longer feel that you have the choice to stop. It seems stronger than you. It also gives you a false sense of pleasure, pleasure that invariably turns into pain. 

实际上这种强迫性的思维是一种上瘾症。上瘾症的特点是什么？非常简单：你没法选择停止，它甚至比你还强大。它同样给你一种错误的乐趣，而这种乐趣会最终变成痛苦。

> Why should we be addicted to thinking?
>
> 我们为什么会对思维上瘾呢？

Because you are identified with it, which means that **you derive your sense of self from the content and activity of your mind**. Because you believe that you would cease to be if you stopped thinking. As you grow up, you form a mental image of who you are, based on your personal and cultural conditioning. We may call this phantom self the ego. It consists of mind activity and can only be kept going through constant thinking. The term ego means different things to different people, but when I use it here it means a **false self**, created by unconscious identification with the mind.

因为你认同思维，就是说，你从思维的内容和活动中获取自我的感觉，因为你认为，如果你停止思维活动，你将不复存在。随着你逐渐长大，在你个人和文化环境的制约下，你在脑海中勾勒出了自己的形象。我们不妨把这个虚幻的自我称为“小我”。小我由思维活动组成，只有不断地进行思考它才能存活。“小我”这个词对不同的人来说有不同的含义，但是在这里，我所指的是虚假的自我，它是我们无意识地认同于思维而产生的。

To the ego, the present moment hardly exists. Only past and future are considered important. This total reversal of the truth accounts for the fact that in the ego mode the mind is so dysfunctional. It is always concerned with keeping the past alive, because without it who are you? **It constantly projects itself into the future to ensure its continued survival and to seek some kind of release or fulfillment there**. It says: “One day, when this, that, or the other happens, I am going to be okay, happy, at peace.” Even when the ego seems to be concerned with the present, it is not the present that it sees: It misperceives it completely because it looks at it through the eyes of the past. Or it reduces the present to a means to an end, an end that always lies in the mind-projected future. Observe your mind and you'll see that this is how it works.

对于小我来说，当下时刻几乎不存在，只有过去和未来才是重要的——完全颠倒是非。这是因为，当我们的大脑由小我掌控时，它是功能失调的。小我尽力使过去发生的事情复活，因为如果没有过去，你将会是谁？它还不断地把自己投射到未来，以确保它能继续存活，并且在未来寻找某种慰藉或满足。它会说：“某天，当这个、那个或其他的事情发生时，我就会很好、很幸福，也很平和。”即使当小我看似在关切当下时，它所关切的也不是眼前的当下，因为小我看待当下的方式完全错误——它是以过去的眼光来看的。或者它把当下作为达成未来目的的手段，而这个目的，始终存在于思维所投射出的未来。观察你的思维，你就会看到小我的这种运作方式。

The present moment holds the key to liberation. But you cannot find the present moment as long as you are your mind.

当下时刻就是解脱的关键。但是，只要你认同你的思维，你就难以找到当下。

> I don't want to lose my ability to analyze and discriminate. I wouldn't mind learning to think more clearly, in a more focused way, but I don't want to lose my mind. The gift of thought is the most precious thing we have. Without it, we would just be another species of animal. 
>
> 我不希望丧失分析以及辨别事物的能力。我不介意学习如何更清晰地思考问题，但我不愿失去我的大脑。思维是我们所拥有的最为贵重的天赋。没有了它，我们将沦为一种动物。

The predominance of mind is no more than a stage in the evolution of consciousness. We need to go on to the next stage now as a matter of urgency; otherwise, we will be destroyed by the mind, which has grown into a monster. I will talk about this in more detail later. **Thinking and consciousness are not synonymous**. Thinking is only a small aspect of consciousness. Thought cannot exist without consciousness, but consciousness does not need thought.

思维的优势不过是意识演化过程中的一个阶段。我们现在就需要向下一个阶段迈进，否则，我们将会被已经演变成怪兽的大脑毁灭了。在下面的章节里我将会对此做详尽的讨论。思维和意识不是同义词，思维只是意识的一小部分。如果没有意识，思维将不复存在，但是意识的存在不需要思维。

Enlightenment means rising above thought, not falling back to a level below thought, the level of an animal or a plant. In the enlightened state, you still use your thinking mind when needed, but in a much more focused and effective way than before. You use it mostly for practical purposes, but you are free of the involuntary internal dialogue, and there is inner stillness. When you do use your mind, and particularly when a creative solution is needed, you oscillate[^41] every few minutes or so between thought and stillness, between mind and no-mind. No-mind is consciousness without thought. Only in that way is it possible to think creatively, because only in that way does thought have any real power. Thought alone, when it is no longer connected with the much vaster realm of consciousness, quickly becomes barren[^42], insane, destructive.

开悟意味着超越思维，而不是下降到思维之下属于动物或植物的层面。在开悟的状态中，必要时你还是会运用你的思维，但是运用思维的方式会更为集中、更有效率。你主要为实际的目的而运用思维，但是你会从不自主的自我对话中解放出来，享有内在的宁静。当你利用你的思维时，尤其当你需要一个创造性的解决方案时，你会在思维和静止之间、思维和无念之间徘徊。无念是有意识但没有思维。只有在这种方式下，你才有可能进行创造性的思考，因为只有在这种方式下，思维才有真正的力量。当思维与意识失去联系时，思维会快速地枯竭、变得病态和具有破坏性。

The mind is essentially a survival machine. Attack and defense against other minds, gathering, storing, and analyzing information this is what it is good at, but it is not at all creative. All true artists, whether they know it or not, create from a place of no-mind, from inner stillness. The mind then gives form to the creative impulse or insight. Even the great scientists have reported that their creative breakthroughs came at a time of mental quietude[^43]. The surprising result of a nation-wide inquiry among America's most eminent mathematicians, including Einstein, to find out their working methods, was that thinking “plays only a subordinate[^44] part in the brief, decisive phase of the creative act itself.” So I would say that the simple reason why the majority of scientists are not creative is not because they don't know how to think but because they don't know how to stop thinking!

思维在本质上是一种求生的机器。攻击、防范其他的思维，收集、储藏和分析信息——这是它所擅长的，但是这些不具有创造性。所有真正的艺术家，不管他们是否知道，都是在无念的、内在宁静的状态下进行创作。即使最伟大的科学家都声称他们的创造性突破来自无念状态。对美国最著名的科学家（包括爱因斯坦在内）的调查令人吃惊，调查结果显示，“在那个短暂的、决定性的创造本身的过程中，思维只起到了小部分的作用”。所以我可以说，绝大部分人不具有创造性，不是因为他们不懂得如何去使用思维，而是他们不懂得如何停止思维。

It wasn't through the mind, through thinking, that the miracle that is life on earth or your body were created and are being sustained. There is clearly an intelligence at work that is far greater than the mind. How can a single human cell measuring 1/1,000 of an inch across contain instructions within its DNA that would fill 1,000 books of 600 pages each? The more we learn about the workings of the body, the more we realize just how vast is the intelligence at work within it and how little we know. When the mind reconnects with that, it becomes a most wonderful tool. It then serves something greater than itself.

身体或生命的奇迹不是通过思维来创造和得以维持的。很明显，有一种比思维更重要的智慧在起作用。一个长度只有1/1 000英寸的人类细胞，它的DNA里包含的指令足以填满1 000本、每本有600页的书，这是如何做到的呢？我们对身体的工作原理了解得越多，我们就会越多地认识到在它之内运作的智力是多么伟大，而我们对它的了解又是多么少。当思维与智力联结起来时，它将会变成一个多么伟大的工具。

## EMOTION: THE BODY'S REACTION TO YOUR MIND

> What about emotions? I get caught up in my emotions more than I do in my mind.
>
> 情绪是什么？我陷入情绪的时间比陷入思维的时间多。

Mind, in the way I use the word, is not just thought. It includes your emotions as well as all unconscious mental-emotional reactive patterns. **Emotion arises at the place where mind and body meet**. It is the **body's reaction to your mind** or you might say, **a reflection of your mind in the body**. For example, an attack thought or a hostile thought will create a build-up of energy in the body that we call anger. The body is getting ready to fight. The thought that you are being threatened, physically or psychologically, causes the body to contract, and this is the physical side of what we call fear. Research has shown that strong emotions even cause changes in the biochemistry of the body. These biochemical changes represent the physical or material aspect of the emotion. Of course, you are not usually conscious of all your thought patterns, and it is often only through watching your emotions that you can bring them into awareness.

我这里所说的“思维”，不仅仅是指思考，还包括你的情绪以及所有无意识的心理——情绪反应模式。情绪在思维和身体的相遇处产生。它是身体对思维的反应——或者可以说，它是思维在身体上的反映。比如，一个攻击性的想法或敌对的想法会聚集你体内的被我们称为愤怒的能量。这时身体准备开始战斗。身体上和精神上受到威胁的想法促使身体收缩，这就是我们所谓的恐惧在身体上的反映。研究显示，强烈的情感甚至会导致身体的生理变化。这些生理变化代表着情绪的身体层面或物质层面。当然，你通常不会意识到你所有的思维模式，通常只有通过观察你的情感，你才能对它们保持意识。

The more you are identified with your thinking, your likes and dislikes, judgments and interpretations, which is to say the less present you are as the watching consciousness, the stronger the emotional energy charge will be, whether you are aware of it or not. If you cannot feel your emotions, if you are cut off from them, you will eventually experience them on a purely physical level, as a physical problem or symptom. A great deal has been written about this in recent years, so we don't need to go into it here. **A strong unconscious emotional pattern may even manifest as an external event that appears to just happen to you**. For example, I have observed that people who carry a lot of anger inside without being aware of it and without expressing it are more likely to be attacked, verbally or even physically, by other angry people, and often for no apparent reason. They have a strong emanation of anger that certain people pick up subliminally[^45] and that triggers their own latent anger.

你被你的思维、喜好、判断以及分析控制得越多，也就是说你的观察者意识越少的话，你的情绪能量的负荷就会越强，不管你是否意识到了这一点。如果你不能感受到你的情绪，或是切断了与情绪的联系，那么你最终会在纯生理这一层面体验到它们，它们会以生理问题或疾病的形式出现。近几年来，有许多关于此方面的文章，所以在这里我们不需要再来细说。强烈的无意识情感模式可能会显化成发生在你身上的外部事件。比如，我观察到那些内心充满愤怒而没有意识到这一点，也没有表达愤怒的人，更容易从言语上或身体上遭受其他愤怒之人的莫名其妙的攻击。这是因为他们散发着强烈的愤怒波动，被某人无意识地接收，从而引爆了这个人自己内心潜伏的愤怒。

If you have difficulty feeling your emotions, start by focusing attention on the inner energy field of your body. Feel the body from within. This will also put you in touch with your emotions. We will explore this in more detail later.

如果你很难感受你的情绪，那么请先试着将注意力集中在你身体的内在能量场上。从里至外感受你的身体。这将会使你感受到你的情绪。稍后我们将会对此做详细的讨论。

> You say that an emotion is the mind's reflection in the body. But sometimes there is a conflict between the two: the mind saps “no” while the emotion saps "yes,' or the other way around. 
>
> 你说情绪是思维在身体上的反映，但是有时这两者之间也会发生分歧：当思维说“不”时，情绪可能会说“好”，或者反之。

If you really want to know your mind, the body will always give you a truthful reflection, so look at the emotion or rather feel it in your body. If there is an apparent conflict between them, the thought will be the lie, the emotion will be the truth. Not the ultimate truth of who you are, but the relative truth of your state of mind at that time.

如果你真的想了解你的思维，身体总是会给你一个真实的反映，所以请在你体内去看或是感受它。如果两者之间有明显的分歧，那么思维永远是说谎的一方，情绪则始终是真实的。这里所说的真实，并不是指你是谁的终极真理，而是你当时思维状态的相对真实。

Conflict between surface thoughts and unconscious mental processes is certainly common. You may not yet be able to bring your unconscious mind activity into awareness as thoughts, but it will always be reflected in the body as an emotion, and of this you can become aware. To watch an emotion in this way is basically the same as listening to or watching a thought, which I described earlier. The only difference is that, while a thought is in your head, an emotion has a strong physical component and so is primarily felt in the body. You can then allow the emotion to be there without being controlled by it. You no longer are the emotion; you are the watcher, the observing presence. If you practice this, all that is unconscious in you will be brought into the light of consciousness.

表面的思维和无意识的精神活动之间的冲突当然是很常见的。你也许还不能把无意识的思维活动变成有觉知的，并感受到它，但它总是会以一种情绪的方式在身体上反映出来，好让你能察觉到它。运用这种方式来观察情绪，和“倾听或观察思维”有异曲同工之妙。唯一的区别是，思维存在于你的大脑里，情感却具有强烈的生理成分，所以你可以在体内感觉到它。然后，你可允许情绪的存在，但却不要受它控制。你不再是你的情绪，而是一个观察者。如果你这样做，所有无意识的东西都将会被意识之光所照亮。

> So observing our emotions is as important as observing our thoughts?
>
> 所以，观察我们的情绪像观察我们的思维一样重要吗？

Yes. Make it a habit to ask yourself. **Whats going on inside me at this moment?** That question will point you in the right direction. But don't analyze, just watch. Focus your attention within. Feel the energy of the emotion. If there is no emotion present, take your attention more deeply into the inner energy field of your body. It is the doorway into Being.

是的。你应该习惯这样问自己：“此刻，我内在发生了什么事情？”这个问题将会把你引向正确的方向。但是，请不要进行分析，观察就可以了。请将你的注意力集中于内在，并且去感觉情绪的能量。如果没有情绪存在，那么请更深地去关注你身体的内在能量场。这就是进入本体的大门。

An emotion usually represents an **amplified and energized thought pattern**, and because of its often overpowering energetic charge, it is not easy initially to stay present enough to be able to watch it. It wants to take you over, and it usually succeeds unless there is enough presence in you. If you are pulled into unconscious identification with the emotion through lack of presence, which is normal, the emotion temporarily becomes “you.” Often a vicious circle builds up between your thinking and the emotion: they feed each other. The thought pattern creates a magnified reflection of itself in the form of an emotion, and the vibrational frequency of the emotion keeps feeding the original thought pattern. By dwelling mentally on the situation, event, or person that is the perceived cause of the emotion, the thought feeds energy to the emotion, which in turn energizes the thought pattern, and so on.

情绪通常代表着一个被强化的以及被注入能量的思维模式，由于它的能量是蓄势待发的，所以一开始我们不容易维持临在的意识而观察到它。它要控制你，而且它通常都会得逞——除非你有足够的临在意识。如果你由于缺乏临在意识而陷入无意识的情绪认同之中，这是很正常的，而且这种情绪会暂时地变成“你”。通常，在你的思维和情绪之间有一个恶性循环：它们相依为命。思维模式通过情绪创造了一种它自己的被放大了的反应，而情绪的振动频率又一直为原来的思维模式注入活力。

Basically, all emotions are modifications of one primordial[^46], undifferentiated[^47] emotion that has its origin in the loss of awareness of who you are beyond name and form. Because of its undifferentiated nature, it is hard to find a name that precisely describes this emotion. “Fear” comes close, but apart from a continuous sense of threat, it also includes a deep sense of abandonment and incompleteness. **It may be best to use a term that is as undifferentiated as that basic emotion and simply call it “pain.”** One of the main tasks of the mind is to fight or remove that emotional pain, which is one of the reasons for its incessant activity, but all it can ever achieve is to cover it up temporarily. In fact, the harder the mind struggles to get rid of the pain, the greater the pain. The mind can never find the solution, nor can it afford to allow you to find the solution, because it is itself an intrinsic part of the “problem.” Imagine a chief of police trying to find an arsonist[^48] when the arsonist is the chief of police. You will not be free of that pain until you cease to derive your sense of self from identification with the mind, which is to say from ego. The mind is then toppled[^49] from its place of power and Being reveals itself as your true nature.

基本上来说，所有的情绪都是一种原始的、无差别的情绪的变形，这种情绪源自我们不清楚自己在名字和身体之外究竟是谁。由于它的无差别性，我们很难找到一个准确描述这种情绪的名称。恐惧可能是最贴近的一个答案，但是除了不断地感到威胁之外，它还包括一种深深的被遗弃感和不完整感。我们把它称为“痛苦”是很合适的，因为它和前面说的那种最基本的情绪一样，是无差别的。思维的一个主要任务就是反抗或消除这种情绪上的痛苦，这也是思维活动如此之多的原因。然而思维顶多也只能暂时地将痛苦掩盖住。实际上，思维越是努力去摆脱这种痛苦，痛苦就会越深。思维永远不会找到解决方案，它也不会让你找到解决方案，因为它本身就是问题的一部分。请试想一下本身是纵火犯的警察头目努力寻找纵火犯的情形。除非你停止从思维认同中获取你的自我感，否则你将不会从痛苦中解放出来。只有停止思维认同，你的思维才会丧失它的力量，本体才会以你原来的本性显露出来。

Yes, I know what you are going to ask.

是的，我知道你想要问什么。

> I was going to ask: What about positive emotions such as love and joy?
>
> 我要问：积极的情绪，如爱和喜悦，究竟是什么呢？

They are inseparable from your natural state of inner connectedness with Being. Glimpses of love and joy or brief moments of deep peace are possible whenever a gap occurs in the stream of thought. For most people, such gaps happen rarely and only accidentally, in moments when the mind is rendered “speechless,” sometimes triggered by great beauty, extreme physical exertion[^50], or even great danger. Suddenly, there is inner stillness. And within that stillness there is a subtle but intense joy, there is love, there is peace.

它们是与你和本体相关联的本性不可分割的一部分。当思维空白出现时，感受爱、喜悦或短暂的宁静都是有可能的。对于大部分人来说，只有当感受到极大美感、极度恐惧或体力受到极度挑战时，才能引起思维的暂时失语，这时，思维空白才会产生。当这种思维空白产生时，突然，你就会感受到你内心的宁静，在这种宁静状态中，有一种微妙却很强烈的喜悦、爱与平和。

Usually, such moments are short-lived, as the mind quickly resumes its noise-making activity that we call thinking. Love, joy, and peace cannot flourish until you have freed yourself from mind dominance. But they are not what I would call emotions. They lie beyond the emotions, on a much deeper level. So you need to become fully conscious of your emotions and be able to feel them before you can feel that which lies beyond them. Emotion literally means “disturbance.” The word comes from the Latin emovere, meaning “to disturb.”

通常，这种时刻是很短暂的，因为大脑很快就会恢复它嘈杂的、被我们称为思维的状态。除非你将自己从思维中解放出来，否则爱、喜悦以及平和不会持久。但是它们不是我所谓的情绪，它们处在一个比情绪更深的层面。所以你需要完全地意识到你的情绪，才能感受到它们。“情绪”字面上的意思是“干扰”。这个词源于拉丁文“emovere”，是骚扰的意思。

Love, joy, and peace are deep states of Being or rather three aspects of the state of inner connectedness with Being. As such, they have no opposite. This is because they arise from beyond the mind. Emotions, on the other hand, being part of the **dualistic mind**, are subject to **the law of opposites**. This simply means that you cannot have good without bad. So in the unenlightened, mind-identified condition, what is sometimes wrongly called joy is the usually short-lived pleasure side of the continuously alternating **pain/pleasure cycle**. **Pleasure is always derived from something outside you, whereas joy arises from within.** The very thing that gives you pleasure today will give you pain tomorrow, or it will leave you, so its absence will give you pain. And what is often referred to as love may be pleasurable and exciting for a while, but it is an addictive clinging[^51], an extremely needy[^52] condition that can turn into its opposite at the flick[^53] of a switch[^54]. Many “love” relationships, after the initial euphoria[^55] has passed, actually oscillate between “love” and hate, attraction and attack.

爱、喜悦与平和是深刻的本体状态，或是内心与本体联结时的三个方面。在这种状态下，它们没有对立，这是因为它们都源自思维之外。但情绪则不同，它属于二元思维的一部分，受制于对立法则。简而言之，就是有好必有坏。所以在未开悟的、与大脑认同的状态下，我们称为“喜悦”的东西，只不过是痛苦和欢乐轮流交替时短暂的欢乐而已。欢乐总是衍生于你之外的事物，而喜悦是由内而生的。今天让你欢乐的事情，明天可能会让你痛苦，或者它将会离你而去，所以一旦失去它，你将会感到痛苦。而且，我们通常称为“爱”的东西可能是一种短暂的欢乐和兴奋，一种沉溺性的需求，可能瞬间就向其相反的方向发展。许多爱情在经历起初的激情之后，会在爱与仇恨、吸引和攻击之间徘徊。

Real love doesn't make you suffer. How could it? It doesn't suddenly turn into hate, nor does real joy turn into pain. As I said, even before you are enlightened before you have freed yourself from your mind you may get glimpses[^56] of true joy, true love, or of a deep inner peace, still but vibrantly[^57] alive. These are aspects of your true nature, which is usually obscured by the mind. Even within a "normal" addictive relationship, there can be moments when the presence of something more genuine, something incorruptible, can be felt. But they will only be glimpses, soon to be covered up again through mind interference. It may then seem that you had something very precious and lost it, or your mind may convince you that it was all an illusion anyway. The truth is that it wasn't an illusion, and you cannot lose it. It is part of your natural state, which can be obscured but can never be destroyed by the mind. Even when the sky is heavily overcast[^58], the sun hasn't disappeared. It's still there on the other side of the clouds.

真正的爱不会让你感到痛苦。为什么这么说呢？它不会突然间就变成仇恨，当然真正的喜悦也不会转变成痛苦。如我说过的一样，即使在你开悟之前——在你将自己从思维中解放出来之前，你可能会短暂地感到真正的喜悦、真正的爱或者深沉的内在平静。这些是你真正本性的一些方面，即使在一个正常的爱情关系中，你也会感受到一些更为真实而不朽的东西的存在，但是它们是短暂的，很快就会因思维的介入而消失。这就像你曾经拥有某种很珍贵的东西却突然失去了它，或者你的大脑告诉你这只是一种幻象。实际上，这不是幻象，而且你不会失去它。它是你本性的一部分，它会受思维的影响但永远不会被思维破坏。即使天空乌云密布，太阳也不会消失，它仍然在云层的另一边。

> The Buddha says that pain or suffering arises through desire or craving and that to be free of pain we need to cut the bonds[^59] of desire.
>
> 佛陀说人类的痛苦源于欲望或贪婪，如果你要摆脱痛苦，你就必须摆脱欲望。

All cravings are the mind seeking salvation[^60] or fulfillment in external things and in the future as a substitute for the joy of Being. As long as I am my mind, I am those cravings, those needs, wants, attachments, and aversions, and apart from them there is no 'I' except as a mere possibility, an unfulfilled potential, a seed that has not yet sprouted[^61]. In that state, even my desire to become free or enlightened is just another craving for fulfillment or completion in the future. So don't seek to become free of desire or “achieve” enlightenment. Become present. Be there as the observer of the mind. Instead of quoting the Buddha, be the Buddha, be “the awakened one,” which is what the word buddha means.

思维不停地在外部或未来寻求拯救或满足，以代替本体的喜悦。所有的欲望都来源于此。只要我有思维，我就会有欲望、需要、执着、厌弃等，离开了这些就不会有“我”的存在。在这种情况下，即使我渴望得到自由或开悟，那也是在未来寻求满足或完整的一种欲望。所以不要努力解放你的欲望或试图“达到”开悟的境界。请关注当下，并成为你思维的观察者。不是引用佛的话，而是变成佛，成为觉醒的人，这才是“佛”这个词的含义。

Humans have been in the grip of pain for eons, ever since they fell from the state of grace[^62], entered the realm of time and mind, and lost awareness of Being. At that point, they started to perceive themselves as meaningless fragments in an alien universe, unconnected to the Source and to each other.

人类一直以来都遭受着痛苦，从他们进入了时间和思维的领域，并丧失了对本体的意识，被痛苦折磨了亿万年；从那时起，他们将自己看成是宇宙中无意义的碎片，断绝了自己和源头及他人之间的联系。

Pain is inevitable as long as you are identified with your mind, which is to say as long as you are unconscious, spiritually speaking. I am talking here primarily of emotional pain, which is also the main cause of physical pain and physical disease. Resentment[^63], hatred, self-pity[^64], guilt, anger, depression, jealousy, and so on, even the slightest irritation, are all forms of pain. And every pleasure or emotional high contains within itself the seed of pain: its inseparable opposite, which will manifest in time.

只要你认同思维，也就是说，只要你处于无意识状态，痛苦就不可避免。在这里我主要指的是情绪上的痛苦，这也是造成身体上的痛苦和疾病的主要原因。怨憎、仇恨、自卑、内疚、愤怒、抑郁、嫉妒等，即使是最为轻微的不快都是痛苦的各种表现。并且，每一次的欢乐或情绪的高涨在其内部都隐含着痛苦的种子：痛苦是这些欢乐的不可分割的对立面，而这个对立面迟早会显化出来。

Anybody who has ever taken drugs to get “high” will know that the high eventually turns into a low, that the pleasure turns into some form of pain. Many people also know from their own experience **how easily and quickly an intimate relationship can turn from a source of pleasure to a source of pain**. Seen from a higher perspective, both the negative and the positive polarities are faces of the same coin, are both part of the underlying pain that is inseparable from the mind-identified egoic state of consciousness.

任何通过服用药物来获得快感的人都知道，这种“快感”最终会转变为“低潮”，欢乐终会转变成某种形式的痛苦。许多人从自己的经验中同样能体会到，爱情关系是多么容易而快速地从快乐之源转变成痛苦之源。从一个更高的角度来看，正、负两极是一体两面的，都是潜在痛苦的一部分，而这种潜在痛苦与思维认同的小我意识状态是如影随形的。

There are two levels to your pain: the pain that you create now, and the pain from the past that still lives on in your mind and body. Ceasing to create pain in the present and dissolving past pain this is what I want to talk about now.
