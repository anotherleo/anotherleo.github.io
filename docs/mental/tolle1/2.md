# Ch2 CONSCIOUSNESS: THE WAY OUT OF PAIN


## CREATE NO MORE PAIN IN THE PRESENT

> Nobody's life is entirely free of pain and sorrow. Isn't it a question of learning to live with them rather than trying to avoid them?
>
> 没有人能够完全摆脱痛苦和悲哀。难道我们不应该学会与痛苦共存，而不是去摆脱痛苦吗？

The greater part of human pain is unnecessary. It is self-created as long as the unobserved mind runs your life.

人类的很大一部分痛苦是没有必要的。只要让未被觉察的思维控制着你的生活，痛苦就会自然而然地产生。

The pain that you create now is always some form of non-acceptance, some form of unconscious resistance to what is. On the level of thought, the resistance is some form of judgment. On the emotional level, it is some form of negativity. The intensity of the pain depends on the degree of resistance to the present moment, and this in turn depends on how strongly you are identified with your mind. The mind always seeks to deny the Now and to escape from it. In other words, the more you are identified with your mind, the more you suffer. Or you may put it like this: the more you are able to honor and accept the Now, the more you are free of pain, of suffering and free of the egoic mind.

通常，当下所产生的痛苦都是源自对现状某种形式的不接受、某种形式的无意识抗拒。从思维的层面来说，这种抗拒以批判的形式存在；从情绪的层面来说，它又以负面情绪的形式显现。痛苦的程度取决于你对当下的抗拒程度以及对思维的认同程度。思维通常否认当下，并试图逃离当下。换句话说，你越是认同自己的思维，你就越感到痛苦。或者可以这样说：你越是接受当下，你受的苦就越少，也越能从小我思维中解脱出来。

Why does the mind habitually deny or resist the Now? Because it cannot function and remain in control without time, which is past and future, so it perceives the timeless Now as threatening. Time and mind are in fact inseparable.

为什么思维会习惯性地否认或抗拒当下呢？因为在没有时间（过去和未来）的情况下，它无法发挥自己的作用并对你进行控制，所以它视当下时刻为威胁。实际上，思维和时间是密不可分的。

Imagine the Earth ==devoid== of human life, inhabited only by plants and animals. Would it still have a past and a future? Could we still speak of time in any meaningful way? The question “What time is it?” or “What's the date today?” if anybody were there to ask it would be quite meaningless. The oak tree or the eagle would be bemused by such a question. “What time?” they would ask. “Well, of course, it's now. The time is now. What else is there?”

想象一下：地球上没有人类，只有动物和植物。这时，仍会有过去和未来的存在吗？这时我们仍然能以任何一种有意义的方式来谈论时间吗？“现在几点？”“今天是几号？”问这种问题将会是毫无意义的，橡树或鹰可能会被问傻了！它们可能会说：“现在几点？现在就是现在啊！除此之外还会有什么呢？”

Yes, we need the mind as well as time to function in this world, but there comes a point where they take over our lives, and this is where dysfunction, pain, and sorrow set in.

是的，在这个世界上我们需要时间和大脑来生活，但是，当它们控制了我们的生活时，痛苦和悲哀就产生了。

The mind, to ensure that it remains in control, seeks continuously to cover up the present moment with past and future, and so, as the vitality and infinite creative potential of Being, which is inseparable from the Now, becomes covered up by time, your true nature becomes obscured by the mind. An increasingly heavy burden of time has been accumulating in the human mind. All individuals are suffering under this burden, but they also keep adding to it every moment whenever they ignore or deny that precious moment or reduce it to a means of getting to some future moment, which only exists in the mind, never in actuality. The accumulation of time in the collective and individual human mind also holds a vast amount of residual pain from the past.

为了维持控制，思维不断地利用过去和未来来掩盖当下时刻，从而与当下密不可分的本体的生命力和无限创造潜力就被时间掩盖了，而你的真实本性也被思维混淆了。人类思维中不断积累的时间负担越来越沉重。所有的人都在这种负担下受苦，但是他们又忽视或否认当下这一宝贵的时刻，或认为当下是实现未来目标的一种手段，而未来其实只存于他们的大脑中，是不现实的——人们就这样不断地增加这种负担。人类集体与个人大脑中积累的时间里，也存在了很多过去的残余痛苦。

If you no longer want to create pain for yourself and others, if you no longer want to add to the residue of past pain that still lives on in you, then don't create any more time, or at least no more than is necessary to deal with the practical aspects of your life. How to stop creating time? Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have. Make the Now the primary focus of your life. Whereas before you dwelt in time and paid brief visits to the Now, have your dwelling place in the Now and pay brief visits to past and future when required to deal with the practical aspects of your life situation. Always say “yes” to the present moment. What could be more futile, more insane, than to create inner resistance to something that already is? What could be more insane than to oppose life itself, which is now and always now? Surrender to what is. Say “yes” to life and see how life suddenly starts working for you rather than against you.

如果你不想再为自己和他人创造痛苦，不想再增加你心中过去的痛苦，那么请你不要再创造时间，或者至少不要创造除了做必要事情之外的时间。如何停止创造时间呢？请你务必认识到，当下时刻是你所拥有的一切，把你的生活重心完全放到当下这一刻，把你先前在时间内流连并短暂地访问当下时刻的做法改为关注当下时刻，只在必要时简单地回顾过去和展望未来。永远对当下说“是”。有什么比对已然存在的东西进行内在的抗拒更徒劳、更疯狂的吗？有什么比反对生命本身，也就是当下，而且永远是当下，更疯狂的吗？向“是”臣服，对生活说“是的”，看看生活是如何为你服务而不是与你为敌的。

> The present moment is sometimes unacceptable, unpleasant, or awful.
>
> 有时当下时刻是令人无法接受的，令人痛苦的或者可怕的。

It is as it is. Observe how the mind labels it and how this labeling process, this continuous sitting in judgment, creates pain and unhappiness. By watching the mechanics of the mind, you step out of its resistance patterns, and you can then allow the present moment to be. This will give you a taste of the state of inner freedom from external conditions, the state of true inner peace. Then see what happens, and take action if necessary or possible.

观察大脑是如何为当下时刻贴上标签以及这个贴标签的过程（也就是不断地批判）是如何创造了痛苦和不幸。通过观察思维的活动，你就能够摆脱抗拒的模式，然后还可以允许当下时刻的存在。这将会使你体验到不为外境所困的内心自由，一种真正的内心的宁静状态。然后，再观察发生了什么事情，并采取必要的或可能的行动。

Accept then act. Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. Make it your friend and ally, not your enemy. This will miraculously transform your whole life.

接纳，然后采取行动。不管当下时刻的情况怎样，心甘情愿地接受它，就像它是你选择的一样。总是与它共事，而不是抗拒它，使它成为你的朋友和盟友而不是敌人。这将会不可思议地改变你的整个生活。

## PAST PAIN: DISSOLVING THE PAIN-BODY

As long as you are unable to access the power of the Now, every emotional pain that you experience leaves behind a residue of pain that lives on in you. It merges with the pain from the past, which was already there, and becomes lodged in your mind and body. This, of course, includes the pain you suffered as a child, caused by the unconsciousness of the world into which you were born.

除非你能拥有当下的力量，否则你所体会到的每一个情绪痛苦都会残留一部分，继续在你体内存活。它会与你过去已经存在的痛苦合并，并在你的大脑和身体内扎根。当然，过去的痛苦也包括你孩提时遭受的痛苦，这是因为这个世界的无意识造成的。

This accumulated pain is a negative energy field that occupies your body and mind. If you look on it as an invisible entity in its own right, you are getting quite close to the truth. Its the emotional pain-body. It has two modes of being: dormant and active. A pain-body may be dormant 90 percent of the time; in a deeply unhappy person, though, it may be active up to mo percent of the time. Some people live almost entirely through their pain-body, while others may experience it only in certain situations, such as intimate relationships, or situations linked with past loss or abandonment, physical or emotional hurt, and so on. Anything can trigger it, particularly if it resonates with a pain pattern from your past. When it is ready to awaken from its dormant stage, even a thought or an innocent remark made by someone close to you can activate it.

这种积累起来的痛苦是一个消极的能量场，占据着你的大脑和身体。如果你将它视为存在于你体内的无形的实体，那你就离真理不远了。它就是你情绪的痛苦之身。痛苦之身有两种存在模式：休眠和活跃。在90%的时间内，它可能在你的体内都是处于休眠状态；但是，对一个极端不快乐的人来说，他的痛苦之身可能会100%地处于活跃状态。有些人可能完全生活在痛苦之身的状态下，而有些人则可能偶尔感受到它，比如失恋或与过去的痛苦、失落、身体或情感上的伤害等相关联的情况。任何事情都有可能引发痛苦之身，尤其是当它与你过去的痛苦产生共鸣时。当痛苦之身即将从休眠状态中被激活时，即使是一个念头或与你关系亲密的人的一句不经意的话，都有可能激活它。

Some pain-bodies are obnoxious but relatively harmless, for example like a child who won't stop whining. Others are vicious and destructive monsters, true demons. Some are physically violent; many more are emotionally violent. Some will attack people around you or close to you, while others may attack you, their host. Thoughts and feelings you have about your life then become deeply negative and self- destructive. Illnesses and accidents are often created in this way. Some pain-bodies drive their hosts to suicide. 

有些痛苦之身像个吵闹不休的孩子，虽然令人不愉快，但是它的害处相对较小；而有些痛苦之身则非常邪恶，像具有毁灭性的怪兽，或是像恶魔一般。有些会引起身体上的不适，更多的则是引起情感上的不安。有些会攻击你周围与你亲密的人，而有些则会攻击你自己。然后，你有关生活的想法和感情会变得消极并具有自我毁灭性。疾病和意外往往就是这样产生的，有些痛苦之身甚至会驱使遭受它折磨的人去自杀。

When you thought you knew a person and then you are suddenly confronted with this alien, nasty creature for the first time, you are in for quite a shock. However, it's more important to observe it in yourself than in someone else. Watch out for any sign of unhappiness in yourself, in whatever form it may be the awakening pain-body. This can take the form of irritation, impatience, a somber mood, a desire to hurt, anger, rage, depression, a need to have some drama in your relationship, and so on. Catch it the moment it awakens from its dormant state. 

你本以为你了解某人，但某天你突然碰到的他却变成了一个陌生的、狰狞的野兽，这会让你感到非常吃惊。然而，这时关注自己的内在比关注对方来得更重要。观察你内心任何痛苦的迹象，它的表现形式可能是：愤怒、烦躁、忧郁、伤害他人的欲望、生气、沮丧、想在个人关系中制造冲突的冲动等。在它刚从休眠状态被激活的那一刻，你就应该注意到它。

The pain-body wants to survive, just like every other entity in existence, and it can only survive if it gets you to unconsciously identify with it. It can then rise up, take you over, “become you,” and live through you. It needs to get its “food” through you. It will feed on any experience that resonates with its own kind of energy, anything that creates further pain in whatever form: anger, destructiveness, hatred, grief, emotional drama, violence, and even illness. So the pain-body, when it has taken you over, will create a situation in your life that reflects back its own energy frequency for it to feed on. Pain can only feed on pain. Pain cannot feed on joy. It finds it quite indigestible.

痛苦之身要在你的体内生存，就像其他任何一个实体一样，如果你无意识地被它控制，它就能存活下来。然后，它会控制你，变成你，并经由你而活出它自己。它需要从你的体内获取“食物”。它以任何与它能量共振的经历或各种形式创造的痛苦为“食”，这些形式有愤怒、沮丧、恨、哀怨、感情冲突、暴力，甚至是疾病。当它控制你时，它会在你的生活中创造一种经常能激活它能量的情况，以便它继续生存。痛苦只能以痛苦为食，它不能享用欢乐。欢乐对它而言是难以下咽的。

Once the pain-body has taken you over, you want more pain. You become a victim or a perpetrator. You want to inflict pain, or you want to suffer pain, or both. There isn't really much difference between the two. You are not conscious of this, of course, and will vehemently claim that you do not want pain. But look closely and you will find that your thinking and behavior are designed to keep the pain going, for yourself and others. If you were truly conscious of it, the pattern would dissolve, for to want more pain is insanity, and nobody is consciously insane.

一旦你被痛苦所控制，你会想要更多的痛苦。这时你会成为受害者或者迫害者：你要么为别人制造更多的痛苦，要么受痛苦的折磨，或者两者皆是。实际上，这两者没什么太大的区别。当然，你不会意识到这点，你可能还会说你不要遭受痛苦。但是，如果你仔细观察的话，你会发现自己的思想和行为都在不断地使自己和别人更加痛苦。如果你真正意识到了这一点，这种思维和行为模式就可能会消失。

The pain-body, which is the dark shadow cast by the ego, is actually afraid of the light of your consciousness. It is afraid of being found out. Its survival depends on your unconscious identification with it, as well as on your unconscious fear of facing the pain that lives in you. But if you don't face it, if you don't bring the light of your consciousness into the pain, you will be forced to relive it again and again. The pain-body may seem to you like a dangerous monster that you cannot bear to look at, but I assure you that it is an insubstantial phantom that cannot prevail against the power of your presence.

痛苦之身其实是小我投射出来的阴影，它很害怕你的意识之光。因为一个正常的人是不想受更多的苦的，除非他病了。痛苦之身害怕被你发现。它的生存取决于你对它无意识的认同，以及你面对内在痛苦时，那种无意识的害怕。但是，如果你不面对痛苦，不努力把意识之光带进痛苦中，你将会被迫一次又一次地激活你的痛苦之身。痛苦之身对于你来说就像一个危险的怪物，你甚至不敢直视它。但是我可以肯定地说，它只是一个幻觉，它在你临在的力量下没法存活。

Some spiritual teachings state that all pain is ultimately an illusion, and this is true. The question is: Is it true for you? A mere belief doesn't make it true. Do you want to experience pain for the rest of your life and keep saying that it is an illusion? Does that free you from the pain? What we are concerned with here is how you can realize this truth that is, make it real in your own experience.

很多心灵导师说，所有的痛苦实际上都是一种幻觉，这是真的。问题是：对你来说，这是真的吗？你单凭这样的信念并不会让你从痛苦中解脱。你愿意在你的余生都遭受这种痛苦，然后还坚持说它只是一个幻觉吗？那样你就可以远离痛苦吗？在这里我们所关注的是，你要如何实践这个真理——也就是说，如何让痛苦从你自己的生活中消失。

So the pain-body doesn't want you to observe it directly and see it for what it is. The moment you observe it, feel its energy field within you, and take your attention into it, the identification is broken. A higher dimension of consciousness has come in. I call it presence. You are now the witness or the watcher of the pain-body. This means that it cannot use you anymore by pretending to be you, and it can no longer replenish itself through you. You have found your own innermost strength. You have accessed the power of Now.

所以，痛苦之身不希望你直接去观察它并认清它。当你观察它，感觉到它在你体内的能量场并关注它时，那种无意识的认同就已经被打破了。这时，一种更高的意识状态产生了，我称它为“临在”（presence）。现在你是这个痛苦之身的见证人或观察者。也就是说，它不会再控制你、假装是你，或在你的体内获取新生的能量了。你已经发现了你自己内在的强大力量，你已经获取了当下的力量。

> What happens to the pain-body when we become conscious enough to break our identification with it?
>
> 当我们有足够的意识来突破对痛苦之身的认同时，它将会变成什么样子呢？

Unconsciousness creates it; consciousness transmutes it into itself. St. Paul expressed this universal principle beautifully:. “Everything is shown up by being exposed to the light, and whatever is exposed to the light itself becomes light.” Just as you cannot fight the darkness, you cannot fight the pain-body. Trying to do so would create inner conflict and thus further pain. Watching it is enough. Watching it implies accepting it as part of what is at that moment.

无意识创造了它，意识将它变回原形。圣保罗优美地说出了宇宙的原理：“万物在光明下无所遁形，同时万物在光的照耀下都会转化成光。”就像你不能向黑暗宣战一样，你不能向痛苦之身宣战，这样做只会引发内心的冲突并创造更深的痛苦。所以观察它就足够了。观察它意味着接纳它成为当下时刻事实的一部分。

The pain-body consists of trapped life-energy that has split off from your total energy field and has temporarily become autonomous through the unnatural process of mind identification. It has turned in on itself and become anti-life, like an animal trying to devour its own tail. Why do you think our civilization has become so life-destructive? But even the life-destructive forces are still life-energy.

痛苦之身由受困的生命能量构成，这种能量是从你总的生命能量中分离出来的，它通过思维认同的反自然过程暂时地取得自治权。它变得反对生命，就像动物试图去追自己的尾巴一样。你知道我们的文明为什么已经变成了一种自残的文明吗？但是即使自残的力量也仍然是生命的能量。

When you start to disidentify and become the watcher, the pain-body will continue to operate for a while and will try to trick you into identifying with it again. Although you are no longer energizing it through your identification, it has a certain momentum, just like a spinning wheel that will keep turning for a while even when it is no longer being propelled. At this stage, it may also create physical aches and pains in different parts of the body, but they wont last. Stay present, stay conscious. Be the ever-alert guardian of your inner space. You need to be present enough to be able to watch the pain-body directly and feel its energy. It then cannot control your thinking. The moment your thinking is aligned with the energy field of the pain-body, you are identified with it and again feeding it with your thoughts.

当你开始不再认同痛苦之身，而成为观察者时，痛苦之身还会继续挣扎一段时间，同时还会试图让你再度认同它。虽然你不再通过认同它而给它能量，但是它还是会保持一定的动能，就像转动的轮子一样，即使你不再推它，它也会因为惯性继续转动一会儿。在这个阶段，它可能还会在你身体的不同部位制造一些疼痛或不适，但是这些痛苦不会持续很久。请保持临在状态，对痛苦保持关注，守卫你的内在空间。你需要充分地保持注意力，才能直接地观察痛苦之身并感受它的力量。这样，它就无法再控制你的思维了。当你的思维被痛苦所控制时，你就会再次与它认同，而痛苦之身就会再次通过你的思维获得生存。

For example, if anger is the predominant energy vibration of the pain-body and you think angry thoughts, dwelling on what someone did to you or what you are going to do to him or her, then you have become unconscious, and the pain-body has become “you.” Where there is anger, there is always pain underneath. Or when a dark mood comes upon you and you start getting into a negative mind-pattern and thinking how dreadful your life is, your thinking has become aligned with the pain-body, and you have become unconscious and vulnerable to the pain-body's attack. “Unconscious,” the way that I use the word here, means to be identified with some mental or emotional pattern. It implies a complete absence of the watcher.

比如说，如果愤怒一直左右着你的思维，你不停地在想别人对你做的事，或你将要对别人做的事，这时你就无意识地被痛苦所控制了，痛苦之身又成了“你”。在有愤怒的地方，通常就有痛苦埋伏在其下。或者，当你心情不好时，你开始有了很多消极的思想，并不断地想你的生活是多么糟糕，这时你的想法就和痛苦之身结合，你就会无意识地被痛苦所控制，也很容易遭受痛苦之身的攻击。此处我所说的“无意识”，是指对某个思想或情绪模式的认同，它隐含的意思是：观察者的完全缺席。

Sustained conscious attention severs the link between the pain-body and your thought processes and brings about the process of transmutation. It is as if the pain becomes fuel for the flame of your consciousness, which then burns more brightly as a result. This is the esoteric meaning of the ancient art of alchemy:, the transmutation of base metal into gold, of suffering into consciousness. The split within is healed, and you become whole again. Your responsibility then is not to create further pain.

持久而有意识的关注切断了痛苦之身和思维之间的桥梁，它会带来转化。也就是说，痛苦成为你意识火焰的燃料，结果是意识之火燃烧得更加猛烈。这就是古代炼金术的深奥意义：将金属变成金子，将痛苦转化成意识。内部的分裂被治愈，你又成为圆满的。这样，你接下来要做的就是不再创造更多的痛苦。

Let me summarize the process. Focus attention on the feeling inside you. Know that it is the pain-body. Accept that it is there. Don't think about it don't let the feeling turn into thinking. Don't judge or analyze. Don't make an identity for yourself out of it. Stay present, and continue to be the observer of what is happening inside you. Become aware not only of the emotional pain but also of “the one who observes,” the silent watcher. This is the power of the Now, the power of your own conscious presence. Then see what happens.

我来总结一下这个过程：将注意力集中在你内心的感受上，了解到这就是痛苦之身并接受它的存在；别去想它，别让你的感受变成大脑和思维，不要去判断或分析它，别在其中寻找你自己的身份认同；保持临在，继续观察你的内在；不仅要觉知到你情绪上的痛苦，更要觉察那个沉默的观察者。这就是当下的力量，这就是你自己有意识的那种临在的力量。然后，请看看接下来会发生什么事情。

For many women, the pain-body awakens particularly at the time preceding the menstrual flow. I will talk about this and the reason for it in more detail later. Right now, let me just say this: If you are able to stay alert and present at that time and watch whatever you feel within, rather than be taken over by it, it affords an opportunity for the most powerful spiritual practice, and a rapid transmutation of all past pain becomes possible.

对许多女性来说，在经期前她们的痛苦之身最容易被惊醒。在后面的章节里我将会对此做详细的讨论。现在，我要说的是：如果你在那时能保持警惕和临在，并能观察你的内心感受而不是被它所控制，你就有可能迅速转化你过去所有的痛苦。

## EGO IDENTIFICATION WITH THE PAIN-BODY

The process that I have just described is profoundly powerful yet simple. It could be taught to a child, and hopefully one day it will be one of the first things children learn in school. Once you have understood the basic principle of being present as the watcher of what happens inside you and you “understand” it by experiencing it you have at your disposal the most potent transformational tool.

我刚刚描述的这个过程非常有力，也非常简单。孩子也可以学习这个过程，希望有一天这将成为孩子在学校里所学到的第一件事。一旦你理解了这个原则或可以对比一下你内心所发生的事情，成为一个临在的观察者，并且实际地去验证它，你将会拥有最强有力的摆脱痛苦的转化工具。

This is not to deny that you may encounter intense inner resistance to disidentifying from your pain. This will be the case particularly if you have lived closely identified with your emotional pain-body for most of your life and the whole or a large part of your sense of self is invested in it. What this means is that you have made an unhappy self out of your pain-body and believe that this mind-made fiction is who you are. In that case, unconscious fear of losing your identity will create strong resistance to any disidentification. In other words, you would rather be in pain be the pain-body than take a leap into the unknown and risk losing the familiar unhappy self.

我们并不否认，当你不再认同你的痛苦之身时，你会遭受强烈的内在抗拒，特别是如果你大半生都强烈地与你的痛苦之身认同，并且从中汲取自我感的话，就更是如此。也就是说你从你的痛苦中创造了一个不幸的自我，并且认为这个由大脑创造的幻觉就是你。在这种情况下，害怕失去自我认同的无意识恐惧，会强烈地抗拒任何摆脱这个思维认同的努力。换句话说，你可能宁愿在痛苦中，与痛苦之身认同，也不愿冒风险去丢失你熟悉的不幸自我而跃入一个未知之中。

If this applies to you, observe the resistance within yourself. Observe the attachment to your pain. Be very alert. Observe the peculiar pleasure you derive from being unhappy. Observe the compulsion to talk or think about it. The resistance will cease if you make it conscious. You can then take your attention into the pain-body, stay present as the witness, and so initiate its transmutation.

如果你所遇到的就是这种情况，请观察你内心的这种抗拒，并观察你对痛苦的执着。一定要非常警觉。请观察你从痛苦中获取的兴奋快感，观察你想谈论它或是琢磨它的冲动。如果你对此有觉知的话，这种抗拒将会停止。这时，你可以关注一下痛苦之身，作为一个临在的见证者，并致力于它的转化。

Only you can do this. Nobody can do it for you. But if you are fortunate enough to find someone who is intensely conscious, if you can be with them and join them in the state of presence, that can be helpful and will accelerate things. In this way, your own light will quickly grow stronger. When a log that has only just started to burn is placed next to one that is burning fiercely, and after a while they are separated again, the first log will be burning with much greater intensity. After all, it is the same fire. To be such a fire is one of the functions of a spiritual teacher. Some therapists may also be able to fulfill that function, provided that they have gone beyond the level of mind and can create and sustain a state of intense conscious presence while they are working with you.

只有你自己可以做这种事情，没有人可以替代你。如果你足够幸运能与意识很强的人在一起，并与他们一起感受临在的状态，这将会对你很有帮助。在这种方式下，你自己的意识之光会增强。如果我们把一块刚刚燃烧的木材放在另一块熊熊燃烧的木材旁边时，过一会儿即使它们分开，第一块木材也会燃烧得更猛烈。毕竟，火是相同的。心灵导师就充当了这种火的功用。有些超越了大脑层次而能创造并维持一种强烈意识临在的治疗师，也可以起到这样的作用。

## THE ORIGIN OF FEAR

> You mentioned fear as being part of our basic underlying emotional pain. How does fear arise, and why is there so much of it in people's lives? And isn't a certain amount of fear just healthy self protection? If I didn't have a fear of fire, I might put my hand in it and get burned. 
>
> 你曾提到恐惧是我们情绪痛苦的一个基础部分。那么，恐惧是如何产生的，它又为何一直困扰着人们的生活呢？一定程度的恐惧是不是一种健康的自我保护呢？比方说，如果我不害怕火，我可能会将手放入火中而被灼伤。

The reason why you don't put your hand in the fire is not because of fear, ifs because you know that you'll get burned. You don't need fear to avoid unnecessary danger just a minimum of intelligence and common sense. For such practical matters, it is useful to apply the lessons learned in the past. Now if someone threatened you with fire or with physical violence, you might experience something like fear. This is an instinctive shrinking back from danger, but not the psychological condition of fear that we are talking about here. 

The psychological condition of fear is divorced from any concrete and true immediate danger. It comes in many forms: unease, worry, anxiety, nervousness, tension, dread, phobia, and so on. This kind of psychological fear is always of something that might happen, not of something that is happening now. You are in the here and now, while your mind is in the future. This creates an anxiety gap. And if you are identified with your mind and have lost touch with the power and simplicity of the Now, that anxiety gap will be your constant companion. You can always cope with the present moment, but you cannot cope with something that is only a mind projection you cannot cope with the future.

你不将手放入火中的原因不是因为恐惧，而是因为你知道那样的话你的手会被灼伤。你不需要利用恐惧来避免没必要的危险——因为这只是一个最简单的常识。对于这些事情，运用过去所获得的经验就可以了。如果某人用火或暴力来威胁你时，你就会体验到恐惧之类的感觉了。这是一种逃避危险求得生存的本能，而不是我们在这里所谈论的心理上的恐惧。心理上的恐惧其实和任何具体的、真正迫在眉睫的危险无关。恐惧的表现形式有多种：不安、忧烦、焦虑、紧张、压力、畏缩、恐怖等。这种心理上的恐惧总是源于“可能会发生的事件”，而非“当下正在发生的事件”。你身处此时此刻，而你的思维却跑到了未来。这就创造了一种焦虑的鸿沟。如果你被你的思维控制并失去了当下的力量，这种焦虑的鸿沟就会与你相依相伴。当下的事情是你可以去应付的，但是你无法应付未来存在于思维中的事情。

Moreover, as long as you are identified with your mind, the ego runs your life, as I pointed out earlier. Because of its phantom nature, and despite elaborate defense mechanisms, the ego is very vulnerable and insecure, and it sees itself as constantly under threat. This, by the way, is the case even if the ego is outwardly very confident. Now remember that an emotion is the body's reaction to your mind. What message is the body receiving continuously from the ego, the false, mind-made self? Danger, I am under threat. And what is the emotion generated by this continuous message? Fear, of course.

如我先前所提到的，只要你认同于你的思维，你的小我就会控制你的生活。由于小我的虚幻本质（即使它有精密的防御机制），小我通常很脆弱，很没有安全感。它会时时感到自己身处威胁之下——即使小我外表看起来非常自信，实际情况也会如此。现在，请记住，情绪是身体对你思维的反应。身体从小我（大脑虚构的自我）一直收到的信息是什么呢？“危险，处于威胁之中。”这时，这种信息所创造的情绪又是什么呢？当然是恐惧。

Fear seems to have many causes. Fear of loss, fear of failure, fear of being hurt, and so on, but ultimately all fear is the ego's fear of death, of annihilation. To the ego, death is always just around the corner. In this mind-identified state, fear of death affects every aspect of your life. For example, even such a seemingly trivial and “normal” thing as the compulsive need to be right in an argument and make the other person wrong defending the mental position with which you have identified is due to the fear of death. If you identify with a mental position, then if you are wrong, your mind-based sense of self is seriously threatened with annihilation. So you as the ego cannot afford to be wrong. To be wrong is to die. Wars have been fought over this, and countless relationships have broken down.

看起来，造成恐惧的原因有许多种，害怕失去、害怕失败、害怕受伤害等。其实，所有的恐惧都是源自小我对死亡、毁灭的恐惧。对于小我来说，死亡无处不在。在这种思维认同的状态下，对死亡的恐惧影响着生活的方方面面。即使是一件微不足道的平常小事，像在与别人的争论中迫切地希望打败对方，以证明自己是对的，都是由于小我对死亡的恐惧而引起的。如果你认同自己的观点，当出现错误的时候，你这种以思维为基础的自我感觉就会受到死亡的严重威胁。所以你的小我不能承认错误，错误就等于死亡。很多战争就因此而起，无数的人际关系也因此而破裂。

Once you have disidentified from your mind, whether you are right or wrong makes no difference to your sense of self at all, so the forcefully compulsive and deeply unconscious need to be right, which is a form of violence, will no longer be there. You can state dearly and firmly how you feel or what you think, but there will be no aggressiveness or defensiveness about it. Your sense of self is then derived from a deeper and truer place within yourself, not from the mind. Watch out for any kind of defensiveness within yourself. What are you defending? An illusory identity, an image in your mind, a fictitious entity. By making this pattern conscious, by witnessing it, you disidentify from it. In the light of your consciousness, the unconscious pattern will then quickly dissolve. This is the end of all arguments and power games, which are so corrosive to relationships. Power over others is weakness disguised as strength. True power is within, and it is available to you now.

一旦你不再认同你的思维，不管你是对还是错，对于你的自我感觉来说都没有区别，所以那种迫切希望胜过对方的欲望，以及深深地希望自己是正确的那种无意识状态（其实是某种形式的暴力）将会消失。你可以清晰并坚定地说出自己的感受和想法，但是不用攻击或防卫。在这种情况下，你的自我感来自你内在的一个更深、更真实的地方，而不是来自你的思维。请观察你内在的任何一种防卫感——你在防卫什么呢？一个虚幻的身份，一个思维创造出来的形象。对这个模式保持觉知并观察它，这样你就会从这种思维认同模式中解脱出来。在你的意识之光下，这种无意识的模式很快就会投降了。这就是所有争论和权力斗争的终结，这些争论和权力斗争对人类关系的破坏力极大。想要凌驾他人之上的人，只是用权力掩饰软弱。真正的力量是在你的内心深处，而此刻你就已经拥有了它。

So anyone who is identified with their mind and, therefore, disconnected from their true power, their deeper self rooted in Being, will have fear as their constant companion. The number of people who have gone beyond mind is as yet extremely small, so you can assume that virtually everyone you meet or know lives in a state of fear. Only the intensity of it varies. It fluctuates between anxiety and dread at one end of the scale and a vague unease and distant sense of threat at the other. Most people become conscious of it only when it takes on one of its more acute forms.

所以任何被思维控制的人，就是与真正力量脱节的人，时时刻刻都会有恐惧相随。能够超越思维的人数量极少，所以你可以推测，你遇到的或认识的每一个人几乎都生活在恐惧的状态下，只是恐惧的程度不同而已。我们在恐惧的两极之间徘徊，一端是焦虑和害怕，另一端是隐约的不安和威胁感。只有当情况变得严重时，大部分人才能意识到这点。

## THE EGO'S SEARCH FOR WHOLENESS

Another aspect of the emotional pain that is an intrinsic part of the egoic mind is a deep-seated sense of lack or incompleteness, of not being whole. In some people, this is conscious, in others unconscious. If it is conscious, it manifests as the unsettling and constant feeling of not being worthy or good enough. If it is unconscious, it will only be felt indirectly as an intense craving, wanting and needing. In either case, people will often enter into a compulsive pursuit of ego-gratification and things to identify with in order to fill this hole they feel within. So they strive after possessions, money, success, power, recognition, or a special relationship, basically so that they can feel better about themselves, feel more complete. But even when they attain all these things, they soon find that the hole is still there, that it is bottomless. Then they are really in trouble, because they cannot delude themselves anymore. Well, they can and do, but it gets more difficult.

与小我思维不可分离的情绪痛苦的另一种表现，是一种深深的缺乏感或不完整感。有些人意识到了这一点，而有些人则没有。如果意识到了这点，这种感觉就是不安、无价值感或自己不够好的感觉。没有意识到这点的人，就会间接地感觉到强烈的欲望和需求。不管是以上哪种情况，人们通常会不由自主地去追求一种自我的满足感和可供认同的事物，以便弥补他们内在感到的空虚。他们拼命追求财富、成功、权力、名望或者一种特殊的关系，这样他们能自我感觉更好一些，感觉更圆满一点。但是，即使他们拥有了这些东西，这种内在的空虚仍然存在，并且还是个无底洞。然后，他们真正地陷入麻烦之中，因为他们不能再逃避了。当然，他们还是可以逃避，但是逃避将变得更加困难。

As long as the egoic mind is running your life, you cannot truly be at ease; you cannot be at peace or fulfilled except for brief intervals when you obtained what you wanted, when a craving has just been fulfilled. Since the ego is a derived sense of self, it needs to identify with external things. It needs to be both defended and fed constantly. The most common ego identifications have to do with possessions, the work you do, social status and recognition, knowledge and education, physical appearance, special abilities, relationships, personal and family history, belief systems, and often also political, nationalistic, racial, religious, and other collective identifications. None of these is you. 

只要这种小我思维控制着你的生活，你就不会真正得到安逸；即使你获得了你所期望的东西，实现了你的理想，你还是不会处于平静的状态，即使有，也是短暂的。由于小我是一种衍生出来的自我感觉，所以它需要认同于外在事物。它需要不断地被维护和喂养。最常见的自我认同与财产、工作、社会地位、名望、知识和教育、外表、特殊技能、人际关系、个人和家族历史、宗教信仰、种族等其他集体认同有关。所有这些都不是真正的你。

Do you find this frightening? Or is it a relief to know this? All of these things you will have to relinquish sooner or later. Perhaps you find it as yet hard to believe, and I am certainly not asking you to believe that your identity cannot be found in any of those things. You will know the troth of it for yourself. You will know it at the latest when you feel death approaching. Death is a stripping away of all that is not you. The secret of life is to “die before you die” and find that there is no death.

你觉得很震惊吗？或是知道这些反而让你感到松了一口气？你迟早会放弃所有这一切的。或许你会觉得这一切难以置信，但你迟早会知道有关它的真理。至少当你感到死亡即将来临时，你就会知道它。因为死亡来临时，会带走所有不能代表你的东西。生命的秘密在于：“在你死亡之前死亡”——并发现原来根本没有死亡。
