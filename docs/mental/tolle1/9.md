# Ch9 BEYOND HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS THERE IS PEACE

## THE HIGHER GOOD BEYOND GOOD AND BAD

> Is there a difference between happiness and inner peace?
>
> 快乐和内在的平和之间有区别吗？

Yes. Happiness depends on conditions being perceived as positive; inner peace does not.

是的。快乐取决于被认知为正面的情况，而内在的平和则不是。

> Is it not possible to attract only positive conditions into our life? If our attitude and our thinking are always positive, we would manifest only positive events and situations, wouldn't we?
>
> 我们是不是不可能只将正面的情况带入我们的生活之中？如果我们的态度和思维一直都是正面的，我们就只会显化正面、积极的事情，不是吗？

Do you truly know what is positive and what is negative? Do you have the total picture? There have been many people for whom limitation, failure, loss, illness, or pain in whatever form turned out to be their greatest teacher. It taught them to **let go of false self-images and superficial ego-dictated goals and desires**. It gave them **depth, humility, and compassion**. It made them more **real**.

你真的知道什么是正和负吗？你对此有一个总的概念吗？对于许多人来说，障碍、失败、损失、疾病或任何形式的痛苦都转变成了他们最伟大的老师。它教他们放弃错误的自我意象以及表面上的以小我为主导的目标和欲望。它给予他们深度、人道和同情心，它使他们更为真实。

Whenever anything negative happens to you, there is a deep lesson concealed within it, although you may not see it at the time. Even a brief illness or an accident can show you what is real and unreal in your life, what ultimately matters and what doesn't. Seen from a higher perspective, **conditions are always positive**. To be more precise: they are neither positive nor negative. They are as they are. And when you live in complete acceptance of what is which is the only sane way to live there is no “good” or “bad” in your life anymore. There is only a higher good which includes the “bad.” Seen from the perspective of the mind, however, there is good-bad, like-dislike, love-hate. Hence, in the Book of Genesis, it is said that Adam and Eve were no longer allowed to dwell in “paradise” when they “ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.”

无论何时，当负的事情在你身上发生时，在它下面都有着深刻的教训，尽管当时你可能看不到。即使是一次短期的疾病或一个突发事件，都可能会向你展示生活中什么是真实的，什么是假的，什么才真正重要，而什么一点儿也不重要。从一个更高的角度来看，所有的情境都是正的。更为准确地说：它们不正也不负。它们就是它们的样子。而当你完全接受本然——这是唯一明智的生活方法——在你的生活中就不会再有“好”和“坏”了，只有更高的善，包括“坏”在内的恶。然而从思维的角度来说，就有好和坏、喜和恶、爱和恨之分。因此，《圣经·创世纪》说，当亚当和夏娃偷吃了善恶树的禁果后，他们就被逐出天堂了。

> This sounds to me like denial and self-deception. When something dreadful happens to me or someone close to me accident, illness, pain of some kind or death I can pretend that it isn't bad, but the fact remains that it is bad, so why deny it?
>
> 对我来说，这听起来就像否认事实和自欺欺人。当一些可怕的事情发生在我身上和我亲密的人身上时——意外、疾病、某种痛苦或死亡，我可以假装它一点也不坏。但是事实是，这是坏事，所以为什么要去否认呢？

You are not pretending anything. You are allowing it to be as it is, thats all. This “allowing to be” takes you beyond the mind with its resistance patterns that create the positive-negative polarities. It is an essential aspect of forgiveness. Forgiveness of the present is even more important than forgiveness of the past. If you forgive every moment allow it to be as it is then there will be no accumulation of resentment that needs to be forgiven at some later time.

你没有在假装任何事情。你只是允许事实的存在，就是这样。这种“允许事实存在”的做法会使你超越有抗拒模式的思维，这种思维会创造正和负。这是宽恕的关键。对当下的宽恕甚至比对过去的宽恕更为重要。如果你宽恕每一刻，允许它的存在——你就不会去积累需要在未来宽恕的怨恨了。

Remember that we are not talking about happiness here. For example, when a loved one has just died, or you feel your own death approaching, you cannot be happy. It is impossible. But you can be at peace. There may be sadness and tears, but provided that you have relinquished[^1] resistance, underneath the sadness you will feel a deep **serenity**, a **stillness**, a **sacred presence**. This is the emanation[^2] of Being, this is inner peace, the good that has no opposite. 

记住，我们在这里谈论的不是幸福。比如，当你深爱的人去世，或者你感到死亡正在向你靠近，你绝不会感到幸福，因为这是不可能的，但是你可以处于一种平和的状态。你可能会悲伤和流泪，但是如果你放弃了抗拒，在你的悲伤下面你就会感觉到深深的宁静与安详以及神圣的存在。这就是存在的彰显，这就是内心的平静，这种善没有对立面。

> What if it is a situation that I can do something about? How can I allow it to be and change it at the same time?
>
> 如果是一个我能有所作为的情况呢？我怎么能在容许事实存在的同时，又去改变它呢？

**Do what you have to do. In the meantime, accept what is.** **Since mind and resistance are synonymous, acceptance immediately frees you from mind dominance and thus reconnects you with Being**. As a result, **the usual ego motivations for “doing”—fear, greed, control, defending or feeding the false sense of self—will cease to operate**. **An intelligence much greater than the mind is now in charge**, and **so a different quality of consciousness will flow into your doing**.

“Accept whatever comes to you woven in the pattern of your destiny, for what could more aptly[^3] fit your needs?” This was written 2,000 years ago by Marcus Aurelius, one of those exceedingly rare humans who possessed worldly power as well as wisdom. 

做你必须做的事情，同时，接受它的存在。由于思维和抗拒是同义词，接受事实会使你立即从思维中解放出来，并使你重新与本体联结。这样，做事的小我动机——恐惧、贪婪、控制、防卫或发展虚假的自我感——都将会停止活动。比思维更强大的智力因素现在会处于主导地位，所以不同质量的意识将会注入你的行动之中。

It seems that most people need to experience a great deal of suffering before they will relinquish resistance and accept before they will forgive. As soon as they do, one of the greatest miracles happens: the **awakening of Being-consciousness** through what appears as evil, the **transmutation of suffering into inner peace**. The ultimate effect of all the evil and suffering in the world is that it will **force humans into realizing who they are beyond name and form**. Thus, what we perceive as evil from our limited perspective is actually part of the higher good that has no opposite. This, however, does not become true for you except through forgiveness. Until that happens, evil has not been redeemed[^4] and therefore remains evil.

许多人在放弃抗拒和接受事实之前，似乎都得体验大量的痛苦才会宽恕。只要他们接受事实，一个最伟大的奇迹就会出现：通过那些看似邪恶的东西，本体的意识被唤醒，痛苦转变成了内心的平静。世界上所有邪恶和痛苦的最终结果，就是迫使人类认识到他们超越名字和肉身的真正本质。因此，那些通过我们有限的知识面而被认知成邪恶的东西，其实是善的一部分。然而除非你宽恕，它是不会降临在你身上的。如果你不宽恕，邪恶就不会被改变，它还是邪恶。

Through forgiveness, which essentially means recognizing the insubstantiality[^5] of the past and allowing the present moment to be as it is, the miracle of transformation happens not only within but also without. A silent space of intense presence arises both in you and around you. Whoever or whatever enters that field of consciousness will be affected by it, sometimes visibly and immediately, sometimes at deeper levels with visible changes appearing at a later time. You dissolve discord, heal pain, dispel unconsciousness without doing anything simply by being and holding that frequency of intense presence.

通过宽恕，即承认过去和现在的事实存在，转变邪恶的奇迹不仅仅会发生在你内在，而且还会发生在你之外。在你之内和你周围会出现一个强烈临在的宁静空间。任何人或任何事，只要进入这种意识状态的领域，就会受它的影响，这些影响有时是有形的、立即的，有时则是无形的，在后来才会显现。这样，你消除了不协调，治愈了痛苦，驱散了无意识——而你没有做任何事情，仅仅进入当下时刻，并保持当下时刻的临在意识。

## THE END OF YOUR LIFE DRAMA

> In that state of acceptance and inner peace, even though you may not call it “bad,' can anything still come into your life that would be called ”bad" from a perspective of ordinary consciousness?
>
> 在接受事实和内心平静的状态下，即使你不再称它为“坏”，但是从普通意识的角度来说，所谓的不好的事情仍然会进入你的生命中，是这样吗？

Most of the so-called bad things that happen in people's lives are due to unconsciousness. They are self-created, or rather ego-created. I sometimes refer to those things as “drama.” When you are fully conscious, drama does not come into your life anymore. Let me remind you briefly how the ego operates and how it creates drama.

人们生活中大部分不好的事情都是由于无意识而引起的。它们是小我创造的，有时我称它们为“戏剧性事件”。当你完全处于意识状态，戏剧性事件就不会再进入你的生活。现在，请让我提醒你一下，小我是如何运作的，它是如何创造戏剧性事件的。

Ego is the unobserved mind that runs your life when you are not present as the witnessing consciousness, the watcher. The ego perceives itself as a separate fragment in a hostile universe, with no real inner connection to any other being, surrounded by other egos which it either sees as a potential threat or which it will attempt to use for its own ends. **The basic ego patterns are designed to combat its own deep-seated fear and sense of lack**. They are **resistance**, **control**, **power**, **greed**, **defense**, **attack**. Some of the ego's strategies are extremely clever, yet they never truly solve any of its problems, simply because the ego itself is the problem.

当你没有临在、对意识没有觉察时，小我（即未被观察到的思维）控制着你的生活。小我视自己为敌意世界中的孤立碎片，它不会真正和其他本体意识相联结，它被其他的小我包围着，而其他的小我对它来说可能不是具有威胁性，就是供它利用的。小我的基本模式就是反抗它深层的恐惧和缺乏感——抗拒、控制、权威、贪婪、防卫和攻击。有些小我战略非常精明，但是它们从未真正地解决过自身的问题，因为小我本身就是个问题。

When egos come together, whether in personal relationships or in organizations or institutions, “bad” things happen sooner or later: drama of one kind or another, in the form of conflict, problems, power struggles, emotional or physical violence, and so on. This includes collective evils such as war, genocide, and exploitation all due to massed unconsciousness. Furthermore, many types of illness are caused by the ego's continuous resistance, which creates restrictions and blockages in the flow of energy through the body. When you reconnect with Being and are no longer run by your mind, you cease to create those things. You do not create or participate in drama anymore.

不管是在个人关系中还是在组织或团体中，当小我聚集在一起时，坏的事情迟早都会发生：以冲突、问题、挣扎、情绪或身体暴力等形式出现的戏剧性事件。这包括集体罪恶，如战争、种族屠杀和剥削——这些都源自疯狂的无意识。而且，许多种疾病都由小我不断地抗拒而产生，这种抗拒限制了体内生命能量的流通。当你重新与本体相联结时，你就不会再被你的思维所控制，不会再参与或创造这些戏剧性事件。

Whenever two or more egos come together, drama of one kind or another ensues. But even if you live totally alone, you still create your own drama. **When you feel sorry for yourself, that's drama**. **When you feel guilty or anxious, that's drama**. When you let the past or future obscure the present, you are creating time, psychological time, the stuff out of which drama is made. Whenever you are not honoring the present moment by allowing it to be, you are creating drama. Most people are in love with their particular life drama.

无论何时，当两个或更多的小我聚集在一起的时候，戏剧性事件就会产生。但是即使你完全过着隐居生活，你仍然会创造着你自己的戏剧性事件。当你为自己感到难过时，这就是戏剧性事件；当你感到愧疚或焦虑时，这就是戏剧性事件；当你让过去或未来影响你的现在，你就在创造时间，创造心理时间——这些都是创造戏剧性事件的要素。无论何时，当你不尊重当下时刻，你就在创造戏剧性事件。

**Their story is their identity. The ego runs their life. They have their whole sense of self invested in it.** Even their usually unsuccessful search for an answer, a solution, or for healing becomes part of it. What they fear and resist most is the end of their drama. **As long as they are their mind, what they fear and resist most is their own awakening**.

大部分人都会有他们钟情的戏剧性事件。他们的故事就是他们的身份。小我控制着他们的生活。他们全部的自我感都投诸戏剧性事件中。甚至，他们对答案、解决和治疗方案的探索——通常是不成功的——也变成了戏剧性事件的一部分。他们抗拒和害怕得最多的，就是戏剧性事件的终结。只要被思维控制，他们抗拒的和害怕的，就是从戏剧性事件中清醒过来。

When you live in complete acceptance of what is, that is the end of all drama in your life. Nobody can even have an argument with you, no matter how hard he or she tries. You cannot have an argument with a fully conscious person. **An argument implies identification with your mind** and a mental position, as well as resistance and reaction to the other person's position. The result is that the polar opposites become mutually energized. These are the mechanics of unconsciousness. You can still make your point clearly and firmly, but there will be no reactive force behind it, no defense or attack. So it won't turn into drama. When you are fully conscious, you cease to be in conflict. “No one who is at one with himself can even conceive of conflict,” states A Course in Miracles. This refers not only to conflict with other people but more fundamentally to conflict within you, which ceases when there is no longer any clash between the demands and expectations of your mind and what is.

当你完全接受当下的事实，你生活中的所有戏剧性事件就会终结。没有人能与你争论，不管对方多么努力都没用。你不会与一个有完全意识的人发生争论。争论意味着你认同你的思维和观点，认同你对其他人观点的抗拒和反应。然而，你仍然可以使你的论点清楚而坚定，但是它们背后不会有反应的力量存在，没有防卫和攻击的存在。所以它不会变成戏剧性事件。当你变得完全有意识时，你就不会与别人发生冲突。这种冲突指的是与别人发生的冲突，和发生在你自己身上的冲突。当你思维的要求与期望和当下事实之间不再发生冲突时，所有的冲突就会停止。

## IMPERMANENCE AND THE CYCLES OF LIFE

However, as long as you are in the physical dimension and linked to the collective human psyche, physical pain although rare is still possible. This is not to be confused with suffering, with mental-emotional pain. **All suffering is ego-created and is due to resistance**. Also, as long as you are in this dimension, you are still subject to its cyclical nature and to the law of impermanence of all things, but you no longer perceive this as “bad” it just is.

所有的痛苦都是小我创造的，都是由于抗拒而产生的。只要你处于这种状态之中，你就仍然会受限于循环的本质和无常的规则，但是你不再将它看成坏事，它就是它。

Through allowing the “isness” of all things, a deeper dimension underneath the play of opposites reveals itself to you as an abiding presence, an unchanging deep stillness, an uncaused joy beyond good and bad. This is the joy of Being, the peace of God.

通过承认万物的本然，接受这些事实，你的内心会感受到一种深深的宁静，超越好与坏的喜悦。这就是本体的喜悦，上帝的宁静。

On the level of form, there is birth and death, creation and destruction, growth and dissolution, of seemingly separate forms. This is reflected everywhere: in the life cycle of a star or a planet, a physical body, a tree, a flower; in the rise and fall of nations, political systems, civilizations; and in the inevitable cycles of gain and loss in the life of an individual.

在形式的层面，有看似分离的生与死、创造与毁灭、生长与衰弱。这种情况到处可见：一个星球、一个身体、一棵树、一朵花的生命循环，国家的政治体制、文明的兴衰，在生活中个人不可避免的得与失。

There are cycles of success, when things come to you and thrive, and cycles of failure, when they wither or disintegrate and you have to let them go in order to make room for new things to arise, or for transformation to happen. If you cling and resist at that point, it means you are refusing to go with the flow of life, and you will suffer. 

当事情进展顺利时，就是成功的循环；当事情变得糟糕时，就是失败的循环。这时你必须放弃一些事情，以便为新事物的产生创造空间，为事情的转机创造空间。如果你抗拒这些事情，你就是拒绝与你生命之流一起向前进，就会遭受痛苦。

It is not true that the up cycle is good and the down cycle bad, except in the mind's judgment. Growth is usually considered positive, but nothing can grow forever. If growth, of whatever kind, were to go on and on, it would eventually become monstrous and destructive. **Dissolution is needed for new growth to happen**. One cannot exist without the other.

如果认为向上的发展才是好的，向下的发展是坏的，这是不对的，只有思维才会这样做判断。生长通常被看成是积极的，但是没有东西会永远生长。如果任何形式的生长不断向前发展，最终都会变成怪物或变得具有毁灭性。有衰退才会有新的成长。生长与衰老两者相互依赖。

**The down cycle is absolutely essential for spiritual realization**. You must have failed deeply on some level or experienced some deep loss or pain to be drawn to the spiritual dimension. Or perhaps your very success became empty and meaningless and so turned out to be failure. Failure lies concealed in every success, and success in every failure. In this world, which is to say on the level of form, everybody “fails” sooner or later, of course, and every achievement eventually comes to naught[^6]. **All forms are impermanent**.

对于灵性开悟来说，向下的周期是绝对关键的。你必须遭受一定深度的痛苦或损失才会被灵性世界吸引。或许成功对你来说变得空洞无意义，所以变成失败。失败隐藏在每一次成功之中，而成功又隐藏在每一次失败之中。在形式层面，每一个人迟早都会“失败”，每一个成就最终都会化为乌有。所有的形式都是无常的。

**You can still be active and enjoy manifesting and creating new forms and circumstances, but you won't be identified with them. You do not need them to give you a sense of self. They are not your life, only your life situation.**

你仍然可以积极地、开心地表现和创造新的形式和环境，但是你可以不认同它们。你不需要它们给你一种自我感。它们不是你的生命，只是你的生活情境。

Your physical energy is also subject to cycles. It cannot always be at a peak. There will be times of low as well as high energy. There will be periods when you are highly active and creative, but there may also be times when everything seems stagnant, when it seems that you are not getting anywhere, not achieving anything. A cycle can last for anything from a few hours to a few years. There are large cycles and small cycles within these large ones. Many illnesses are created through fighting against the cycles of low energy, which are vital for regeneration. The compulsion to do, and the tendency to derive your sense of self-worth and identity from external factors such as achievement, is an inevitable illusion as long as you are identified with the mind.

你的身体能量同样受限于这些周期，能量有时会高，有时会低，不可能永远处于高峰期。你有非常积极和具有创造力的时候，但同样也会有万事不顺的时候。一个周期可能是几小时，也可能是几年之久。在这些大循环内包含有大周期和小周期，许多疾病正是由于反抗低能量周期而产生的，然而低能量周期对于重建来说极为关键。我们总是想要有所作为，从外在成就中汲取自我价值、身份认同，但只要你认同你的思维，这些都是一些不可避免的幻象。这些使你很难或无法接受低能量周期，或允许它们的存在。因此，为了消除这些幻象，出于一种自我保护，身体器官就会做出反应并产生疾病，以便让必要的重生发生。

This makes it hard or impossible for you to accept the low cycles and allow them to be. Thus, the intelligence of the organism may take over as a self-protective measure and create an illness in order to force you to stop, so that the necessary regeneration can take place. The cyclical nature of the universe is closely linked with the impermanence of all things and situations. The Buddha made this a central part of his teaching. All conditions are highly unstable and in constant flux[^7], or, as he put it, impermanence is a characteristic of every condition, every situation you will ever encounter in your life. It will change, disappear, or no longer satisfy you. Impermanence is also central to Jesus's teaching: “Do not lay up[^8] for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth[^9] and rust[^10] consume and where thieves break in and steal ....”

宇宙的循环本质与万事万物的无常性紧密相连。佛陀将此作为其教诲的主要部分。所有的情况都是高度不稳定的，都处于不断的流动状态，或者如佛陀所指出的，无常是万事万物的本质，也是你生活中将会遇到的所有情况的一个特点。它将会改变、消失或不再满足你。

As long as a condition is judged as “good” by your mind, whether it be a relationship, a possession, a social role, a place, or your physical body, the mind attaches itself to it and identifies with it. It makes you happy, makes you feel good about yourself, and it may become part of who you are or think you are. But nothing lasts in this dimension where moth and rust consume. Either it ends or it changes, or it may undergo a polarity shift: The same condition that was good yesterday or last year has suddenly or gradually turned into bad. The same condition that made you happy, then makes you unhappy. The prosperity of today becomes the empty consumerism of tomorrow. The happy wedding and honeymoon become the unhappy divorce or the unhappy coexistence. Or a condition disappears, so its absence makes you unhappy. When a condition or situation that the mind as attached itself to and identified with changes or disappears, the mind cannot accept it. It will cling to the disappearing condition and resist the change. It is almost as if a limb were being torn off your body.

只要你的思维将某种情况判定成“好的”——不管它是一段关系、一份财产、一个社会角色、一个地方，或者你的身体——你的思维就会执着并认同它。它会使你开心，使你自我感觉良好，还会变成你的自我认同。但是没有什么可以永远存在。它要么改变，要么终结，要么向事情的对立面发展：昨天或去年被认为是好的东西，今天就突然或逐渐地变坏；过去让你开心的今天可能让你不开心；今天的繁华，明天却变成了落寞；幸福的婚礼和蜜月变成了勉为其难的共存或不幸的离婚。或者一种情况消失了，而它的消失让你不开心。当思维依赖的和认同的某个条件或情况改变或消失时，思维就不能接受这个事实。它会执着于消失的情况并抗拒它的改变。这种感觉就像是从你身上撕裂某个肢体一样痛苦。

We sometimes hear of people who have lost all their money or whose reputation has been ruined committing suicide. Those are the extreme cases. Others, whenever a major loss of one kind or another occurs, just become deeply unhappy or make themselves ill. **They cannot distinguish between their life and their life situation**. I recently read about a famous actress who died in her eighties. As her beauty started to fade and became ravaged by old age, she grew desperately unhappy and became a recluse. She, too, had identified with a condition: her external appearance. First, the condition gave her a happy sense of self, then an unhappy one. If she had been able to connect with the formless and timeless life within, she could have watched and allowed the fading of her external form from a place of serenity and peace. Moreover, her external form would have become increasingly transparent to the light shining through from her ageless true nature, so her beauty would not really have faded but simply become transformed into spiritual beauty. However, nobody told her that this is possible. The most essential kind of knowledge is not yet widely accessible.

有时，我们会听说有人由于钱财散尽或名誉不再而自杀。这是一些极端的情况。还有些人在遭受重大损失后便变得非常不开心或生病。这些人不能将他们的生命和他们的生活情境区分开来。我最近读了一篇有关一位著名女演员的文章，她80多岁逝世。由于年龄的增长，她的青春不在，所以她每天都处于绝望和不快乐之中并隐居了起来。她同样认同了外在的形式条件：她的外貌。首先，条件给了她一个让她开心的自我感觉，然后条件消失了，她又变得不开心起来。如果她能与无形式和无时间的内在生命有所联结，她就可以站在宁静的地方，观察并接受她外貌的变化。而且，由于通过她真本质的光亮，她的外在会越来越透明，所以她的美貌不会消逝，而是转化成了一种心灵之美。然而，没有人告诉她可以这样。这种重要的知识还没有被人们广泛地接受。

The Buddha taught that even your happiness is dukkha, a Pali word meaning “suffering” or “unsatisfactoriness.” It is inseparable from its opposite. This means that your happiness and unhappiness are in fact one. Only the illusion of time separates them.

佛陀教导说，你的幸福同时也是一种痛苦或不满足。幸福与它的对立面是不可分的。这是说，你的幸福和不幸是一个整体，只是时间的幻象将它们分开了而已。

This is not being negative. It is simply **recognizing the nature of things**, so that you don't pursue an illusion for the rest of your life. Nor is it saying that you should no longer appreciate pleasant or beautiful things or conditions. But to seek something through them that they cannot give an identity, a sense of permanency and fulfillment is a recipe for frustration and suffering. The whole advertising industry and consumer society would collapse if people became enlightened and no longer sought to find their identity through things. **The more you seek happiness in this way, the more it will elude[^11] you**. Nothing out there will ever satisfy you except temporarily and superficially, but you may need to experience many disillusionments before you realize that truth. Things and conditions can give you pleasure, but they will also give you pain. Things and conditions can give you pleasure, but they cannot give you joy. **Nothing can give you joy. Joy is uncaused and arises from within as the joy of Being**. It is an essential part of the inner state of peace, the state that has been called the peace of God. It is your natural state, not something that you need to work hard for or struggle to attain.

这不是消极，这只是简单地承认事物的本质，从而让你在余生中不再去追求这种幻象。但这并不是说你不需要再去欣赏、享受开心或美好的事情或情况，而是说不要通过它们去寻找一些它们不能给予的东西——身份认同、永恒和满足的感觉，这是挫折和痛苦的成因。如果人们都开悟了，并不再通过事物来寻求他们的身份，整个广告业和消费社会就会瓦解。你越是用这种方式去寻找幸福，它就会越多地逃避你。外界的事物不会永远地满足你的需求，它们只会暂时地和表面上地满足你，但是你也许要多次体验这些失望后，才能认识到这些事实。事物和生活条件可以给你快乐，但它无法给你喜悦。喜悦是你内在宁静状态的关键部分；它是你的自然状态，不是努力就能获得的。

Many people never realize that there can be no “salvation[^12]” in anything they do, possess, or attain. Those who do realize it often become world-weary[^13] and depressed: if nothing can give you true fulfillment, what is there left to strive for, what is the point in anything? The Old Testament prophet must have arrived at such a realization when he wrote “I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity[^14] and a striving after wind. ” When you reach this point, you are one step away from despair and one step away from enlightenment.

许多人永远都不会意识到，在他们所做的、所拥有的或所取得的任何成就中都没有“拯救”。那些认识到这一点的人通常会感到厌世和抑郁：如果没有东西可以给他们真正的成就感，那么他们还有什么可以去为之拼搏的呢？当你领会了这一点，你离绝望只有一步，离开悟也只有一步。

A Buddhist monk once told me: “All I have learned in the twenty years that I have been a monk I can sum up in one sentence: **All that arises passes away**. This I know.” What he meant, of course, was this: I have learned to offer no resistance to what is; I have learned to allow the present moment to be and to accept the impermanent nature of all things and conditions. Thus have I found peace.

一位佛教徒告诉我：“过去20年来，我学到的所有东西可以用一句话来总结：凡生者必灭。”当然他的意思是：我学会了不去抗拒本然，学会了接受当下，学会了接受万物无常的本质，因此我找到了宁静。

To offer no resistance to life is to be in a state of grace, ease, and lightness. This state is then no longer dependent upon things being in a certain way, good or bad. It seems almost paradoxical, yet when your inner dependency on form is gone, the general conditions of your life, the outer forms, tend to improve greatly. Things, people, or conditions that you thought you needed for your happiness now come to you with no struggle or effort on your part, and you are free to enjoy and appreciate them while they last. All those things, of course, will still pass away, cycles will come and go, but with dependency gone there is no fear of loss anymore. Life flows with ease.

接受生活的现实就是活在一种恩典、安逸和轻松的状态里。这种状态不再取决于事情的好坏。这看似自相矛盾，但是当你不再依赖事物的外在形式之后，你的生活状况、外在形式就会有很大的改善。你认为能让你快乐的人、事或情境，现在，在无挣扎、无努力的情况下来临了，你尽管去享受、欣赏它们。当然，所有的这些事情仍然会消失，循环不止，但是当你不再依赖这些事情时，你就不会恐惧失去。你的生活就会充满安逸。

The happiness that is derived from some secondary source is never very deep. It is only a pale reflection of the joy of Being, the vibrant peace that you find within as you enter the state of nonresistance. Being takes you beyond the polar opposites of the mind and frees you from dependency on form. **Even if everything were to collapse and crumble all around you, you would still feel a deep inner core of peace.** You may not be happy, but you will be at peace.

从外在世界获得的幸福永远不会深刻，它只是你本体喜悦的苍白的反映；只有当你进入无抗拒状态时，你才会找到内在的宁静。本体会让你超越思维的两个对立极，将你从对形式的依赖中解放出来。即使你周围的所有事情都瓦解倒塌，你仍然能感到内心的深深的宁静。你可能无法快乐，但是你的内心却很平和。

## USING AND RELINQUISHING NEGATIVITY

All inner resistance is experienced as negativity in one form or another. **All negativity is resistance**. In this context, the two words are almost synonymous. Negativity ranges from irritation or impatience to fierce anger, from a depressed mood or sullen[^15] resentment to suicidal despair. Sometimes the resistance triggers the emotional pain-body, in which case even a minor situation may produce intense negativity, such as anger, depression, or deep grief.

所有内心的抗拒都是各种形式的消极体验。所有的消极心态都是抗拒。这样说来，这两个词几乎是同义词。消极心态包括烦躁、没耐心、暴怒、压抑、怨恨、自杀性的绝望等。有时，抗拒会引发情绪的痛苦之身，在这种情况下，即使是一件微不足道的小事也会使你产生强烈的消极心态，比如愤怒、抑郁或深深的悲哀等。

**The ego believes that through negativity, it can manipulate reality and get what it wants.** It believes that through it, it can attract a desirable condition or dissolve an undesirable one. A Course in Miracles rightly points out that, whenever you are unhappy, there is the unconscious belief that the unhappiness “buys” you what you want. If “you” the mind did not believe that unhappiness works, why would you create it? The fact is, of course, that negativity does not work. Instead of attracting a desirable condition, it stops it from arising. Instead of dissolving an undesirable one, it keeps it in place. Its only “useful” function is that it strengthens the ego, and that is why the ego loves it. 

小我相信通过消极心态可以操纵现实，得到它所想要的。它相信通过消极心态，能吸引好的情境或消除不好的情境。《奇迹课程》（A Course in Miracles）正确地指出，无论何时，当你不开心时，你其实是抱有一个无意识的观点，就是你的“不开心”会买到你所想要的。如果你的思维不认为这种不开心会对事情有所帮助的话，它为什么还要去创造这种不开心呢？当然，事实是，消极心态没有任何作用。它不但对事情没有帮助，反而是阻碍；它不会消除不利条件，而是让不利条件持续不散。消极心态的唯一“用处”就是加强小我，这就是小我喜欢它的原因。

Once you have identified with some form of negativity, you do not want to let go, and on a deeply unconscious level, you do not want positive change. It would threaten your identity as a depressed, angry, or hard-done-by person. You will then ignore, deny or sabotage the positive in your life. This is a common phenomenon. It is also insane. 

一旦你认同了你的某种消极心态，你就不想放手，同时你在无意识的层面还会抗拒积极的变化，因为你无意识地认同了自己是一个抑郁、愤怒或不开化的人。所以，你就会忽视、拒绝或破坏你生活之中的积极方面的事情，因为它会对你的身份认同产生威胁。这是一种很常见的现象，但是它也是一种病态的行为。

Negativity is totally unnatural. It is a psychic pollutant, and there is a deep link between the poisoning and destruction of nature and the vast negativity that has accumulated in the collective human psyche. No other life form on the planet knows negativity, only humans, just as no other life form violates and poisons the Earth that sustains it. Have you ever seen an unhappy flower or a stressed oak tree? Have you come across a depressed dolphin, a frog that has a problem with self-esteem, a cat that cannot relax, or a bird that carries hatred and resentment? The only animals that may occasionally experience something akin to negativity or show signs of neurotic behavior are those that live in close contact with humans and so link into the human mind and its insanity. 

消极心态完全是不自然的，它是一种心理污染。地球大自然的毒化、毁坏和积累与人类集体思维中的消极心态有很大的关系。地球上只有人类才有消极心态，其他的生物不但没有消极心态，而且也不会像人类一样去侵犯、毒害我们赖以生存的地球。你看到过不开心的花朵或有压力的橡树吗？你是否遇到过抑郁的海豚、自尊有问题的青蛙、无法放松的猫、充满仇恨或怨恨的小鸟？那些偶尔表现出这些消极心态或神经质行为的动物，是因为它们在与人类亲密接触的过程中被人类影响了。

Watch any plant or animal and let it teach you acceptance of what is, surrender to the Now. Let it teach you Being. Let it teach you integrity which means to be one, to be yourself, to be real. Let it teach you how to live and how to die, and how not to make living and dying into a problem.

请观察任何一种动物或植物，让它们教你如何接受现实，向当下臣服。让它们教你如何获得本体意识，教你成为你自己，使你变得更为真实。让它们教你如何生活，如何面临死亡，而且无惧生死。

I have lived with several Zen masters, all of them cats. Even ducks have taught me important spiritual lessons. Just watching them is a meditation. How peacefully they float along, at ease with themselves, totally present in the Now, dignified and perfect as only a mindless creature can be. Occasionally, however, two ducks will get into a fight sometimes for no apparent reason, or because one duck has strayed into another's private space. The fight usually lasts only for a few seconds, and then the ducks separate, swim off in opposite directions, and vigorously[^16] flap their wings a few times. They then continue to swim on peacefully as if the fight had never happened. When I observed that for the first time, I suddenly realized that by flapping their wings, they were releasing surplus energy, thus preventing it from becoming trapped in their body and turning into negativity. This is natural wisdom, and it is easy for them because they do not have a mind that keeps the past alive unnecessarily and then builds an identity around it.

我与几位“禅宗大师”生活过——它们是猫。鸭子也教给过我重要的心灵课程。请在冥想状态下观察它们。你会观察到它们是何等宁静，何等安逸，何等完全地进入当下时刻。它们是如此的完美，这只有无思维的生物才能做得到。偶尔，两只鸭子会发生争斗——有时是无明显原因的，或者因为一只鸭子闯入了另一只鸭子的领域。这种争斗通常只会持续几秒钟，然后这两只鸭子就会分开，向不同的方向游去，并用力扇动几下翅膀。接着它们就像没有发生过争斗一样继续和平地在水上游泳。当我第一次观察到这种情况时，我突然认识到通过扇动翅膀，它们在释放多余的能量，因此这些能量不会蓄积在它们体内进而变成消极的东西。这是自然的智慧，它们很容易就能这样做，因为它们没有思维，不会将不必要的过去记在心中，并从中获取身份感。

> Couldn't a negative emotion also contain an important message? For example, if I often feel depressed, it may be a signal that there is something wrong with my life, and it may force me to look at my life situation and make some changes. So I need to listen to what the emotion is telling me and not just dismiss it as negative.
>
> 消极的情绪不会包含重要的信息吗？比如，如果我经常感到抑郁，这可能是我的生活出了问题的信号，并且这可能会迫使我去观察自己的生活并做一些改变。所以我需要倾听我的情绪在告诉我什么，而不是把它看成消极的东西。

Yes, recurring negative emotions do sometimes contain a message, as do illnesses. But any changes that you make, whether they have to do with your work, your relationships, or your surroundings, are ultimately only cosmetic[^17] unless they arise out of a change in your level of consciousness. And as far as that is concerned, it can only mean one thing: **becoming more present**. When you have reached a certain degree of presence, you don't need negativity anymore to tell you what is needed in your life situation. But as long as negativity is there, use it. Use it as a kind of signal that reminds you to be more present.

是的，消极情绪的重复出现有时的确包含着重要的信息，疾病也是一样。但是你所做的任何改变，不管是与你的工作、爱情，还是周围的环境有关，这些改变都是表面上的，除非你的改变是在意识层面发生的。当你有了一定的临在意识，你就不再需要消极心态来告诉你，在你的生活情境中还需要什么。但只要消极心态存在，就要利用它，将它作为一种提醒你变得更为临在的信号。

> How do we stop negativity from arising, and how do we get rid of it once it is there?
>
> 我们该如何阻止消极心态的产生？当它产生时，我们又该如何去摆脱它呢？

As I said, you stop it from arising by being fully present. But don't become discouraged. There are as yet few people on the planet who can sustain a state of continuous presence, although some are getting dose to it. Soon, I believe, there will be many more. Whenever you notice that some form of negativity has arisen within you, look on it not as a failure, but as a helpful signal that is telling you: “Wake up. Get out of your mind. Be present.”

如我所说，通过完全进入临在状态，你就能阻止消极心态的产生。但是，请不要气馁。在这个世界上只有极少数的人能持续保持意识的临在状态，但我相信，这些人将会越来越多。无论何时当你注意到某种消极心态在你内心出现时，不要将它视为失败，而是视为一种有用的信号：“快保持警惕，远离你的思维，进入当下时刻。”

There is a novel by Aldous Huxley called *Island*, written in his later years when he became very interested in spiritual teachings. It tells the story of a man shipwrecked on a remote island cut off from the rest of the world. This island contains a unique civilization. The unusual thing about it is that its inhabitants, unlike those of the rest of the world, are actually sane. The first thing that the man notices are the colorful parrots perched in the trees, and they seem to be constantly croaking the words “Attention. Here and Now. Attention. Here and Now.” We later learn that the islanders taught them these words in order to be reminded continuously to stay present.

赫胥黎在晚年对灵修非常感兴趣，他写了一本小说——《岛》（Island）。这本书描写了一个男子由于船失事而被困于岛屿中，从而与世隔绝。在这个岛屿上有一种独特的文明，岛上的居民有着与外界不同的健康心智。这个人注意到的第一件事就是，一些彩色的鹦鹉在树上栖息，它们似乎在不断地说：“注意，此时此地。注意，此时此地。”之后我们才知道，这些岛上的居民教鹦鹉说这些话，好不断地提醒自己保持临在的意识状态。

So whenever you feel negativity arising within you, whether caused by an external factor, a thought, or even nothing in particular that you are aware of, look on it as a voice saying “Attention. Here and Now. Wake up.” Even the slightest irritation is significant and needs to be acknowledged and looked at; otherwise, there will be a cumulative build-up of unobserved reactions. As I said before, you may be able to just drop it once you realize that you don't want to have this energy field inside you and that it serves no purpose. But then make sure that you drop it completely. If you cannot drop it, just accept that it is there and take your attention into the feeling, as I pointed out earlier.

所以，无论何时，当你感到内心产生了消极心态时，不管是由外界因素、某个念头还是不知道的原因引起的，把它看成一种提示：“注意，此时此地，请保持警惕。”即使是最为轻微的烦躁也有其意义，也需要觉知和观察，否则它们将会积累起来，变成未受观察的反应。如我之前所说的，一旦认识到你的内在不需要这种能量，并知道这种能量毫无意义时，你就能够放下它。请确认你已经完全放下了。如果你不能放下它，请接受它的存在，并将注意力集中在那个感受上。

As an alternative to dropping a negative reaction, you can make it disappear by imagining yourself becoming transparent to the external cause of the reaction. I recommend that you practice it with little, even trivial, things first. Let's say that you are sitting quietly at home. Suddenly, there is the penetrating sound of a car alarm from across the street. Irritation arises. What is the purpose of the irritation? None whatsoever. Why did you create it? You didn't. The mind did. It was totally automatic, totally unconscious. Why did the mind create it? Because it holds the unconscious belief that its resistance, which you experience as negativity or unhappiness in some form, will somehow dissolve the undesirable condition. This, of course, is a delusion. The resistance that it creates, the irritation or anger in this case, is far more disturbing than the original cause that it is attempting to dissolve.

摆脱消极心态的另外一种方式是：通过把你自己想象成是透明的，让引发反应的外部因素穿过你，进而使它消失。我建议你先从小事开始练习。比如你在家里安静地坐着时，突然街道上传来汽车的警报声。这时愤怒产生了，但是愤怒的目的是什么呢？没有目的。那你为什么要创造这种愤怒呢？你没有这样做，而是思维在这样做。它是自动的，完全无意识的。为什么思维创造它呢？因为思维相信，抗拒，也就是你经历的消极情绪或不快乐的某种形式，也许可以消除你不喜欢的这种情境。这当然是幻象。思维所创造的抗拒，在上述例子中就是你的烦躁或愤怒，比它原来试图去解决的那个肇因还令人讨厌呢！

All this can be transformed into spiritual practice. **Feel yourself becoming transparent**, as it were, without the solidity of a material body. Now allow the noise, or whatever causes a negative reaction, to pass right through you. It is no longer hitting a solid “wall” inside you. As I said, practice with little things first. The car alarm, the dog barking, the children screaming, the traffic jam. Instead of having a wall of resistance inside you that gets constantly and painfully hit by things that “should not be happening,” let everything pass through you.

所有的这些都可以转化成灵修的途径。把你自己看成是透明的，而不是一个固体的肉身。现在，允许噪声或任何造成消极反应的东西穿越你。这样，它们对你的内心来说就不再是一堵坚固的墙了。如我所说的，从很小的事情开始练习，比如汽车的警报声、狗叫声、孩子的啼哭声、交通堵塞等。不要在你的内心建造一堵坚固的抗拒之墙，而总是让那些你觉得它们“不该发生”的事情来敲打你。试着让它们穿越你。

Somebody says something to you that is rude or designed to hurt. Instead of going into unconscious reaction and negativity, such as attack, defense, or withdrawal, you let it pass right through you. Offer no resistance. It is as if there is nobody there to get hurt anymore. That is forgiveness. In this way, you become invulnerable. You can still tell that person that his or her behavior is unacceptable, if that is what you choose to do. But that person no longer has the power to control your inner state. You are then in your power not in someone else's, nor are you run by your mind. Whether it is a car alarm, a rude person, a flood, an earthquake, or the loss of all your possessions, the resistance mechanism is the same.

当有人对你说一些粗鲁或攻击性的话时，不要产生消极的心态或做出无意识的反应，像防卫、攻击或退缩，而是要让它从你身上通过。不要去抗拒，就没有人会受到伤害。这就是宽恕。这样，你会变得坚强无比。如果你愿意的话，你还是可以告诉那个人，他或她的行为是令人无法接受的。这样，那个人不会再有力量来控制你的内心状态，而你拥有了自主权，不再受制于人，也不会被你的思维所控制。不管是汽车的警报声、粗鲁的人、洪水、地震或你所有财产的损失，这种抗拒机制都是一样的。

> I have been practicing meditation, I have been to workshops, I have read many books on spirituality, I try to be in a state of nonresistance but if you ask me whether I have found true and lasting inner peace, my honest answer would have to be “no. ” Why haven't I found it? What else can I do?
>
> 我练习过冥想，参加过很多工作坊，读过许多有关灵性的书，我也努力进入这种无抗拒的状态，但是如果你问我是否找到了真正永久的内心宁静，我诚实的答案是“没有”。为什么我没能找到它？我还能做些别的吗？

**You are still seeking outside, and you cannot get out of the seeking mode**. Maybe the next workshop will have the answer, maybe that new technique. To you I would say. Don't look for peace. Don't look for any other state than the one you are in now; otherwise, you will set up inner conflict and unconscious resistance. Forgive yourself for not being at peace. The moment you completely accept your non-peace, your non-peace becomes transmuted into peace. Anything you accept fully will get you there, will take you into peace. This is the miracle of surrender.

你仍然在外界寻找，而且你无法脱离这种寻找的模式，你认为或许下一个工作坊会有解答，或许新的技巧会有帮助。我要告诉你：不要去寻找宁静。不要去寻找你所处的当下时刻外的任何一种状态，否则你将会创造你内心的冲突和无意识的抗拒。为你不能进入宁静状态而宽恕你自己。在完全接受你非宁静状态的事实的那一刻，你的非宁静状态就会转变成宁静状态。任何你完全接纳的事情都会把你带进宁静状态。这就是臣服的奇迹。

You may have heard the phrase “turn the other cheek,” which a great teacher of enlightenment used 2,000 years ago. He was attempting to convey symbolically the secret of nonresistance and nonreaction. In this statement, as in all his others, he was concerned only with your inner reality, not with the outer conduct of your life.

你可能听过《圣经》中的一句话：“转另一边脸让他打”，这是两千年前开悟大师所用的教材，形象地传达了不抗拒和不反应的秘密。在这句话中，就和其他的教导一样，人所关注的仅是他内在的现实，而不是生活中的外在行为。

Do you know the story of Banzan? Before he became a great Zen master, he spent many years in the pursuit of enlightenment, but it eluded him. Then one day, as he was walking in the marketplace, he overheard a conversation between a butcher and his customer. “Give me the best piece of meat you have,” said the customer. And the butcher replied, “Every piece of meat I have is the best. There is no piece of meat here that is not the best.” Upon hearing this, Banzan became enlightened.

你是否听说过熊泽蕃山的故事？在变成禅宗大师之前，他花了许多年来追求开悟，但他一直没达到。一天，当他路过市场时，无意中听到了一个屠夫和一个顾客之间的对话。顾客说：“给我一块最好的肉。”屠夫回答说：“我这里的每一块肉都是最好的，这里没有任何一块肉不是最好的。”听到这后，蕃山就开悟了。

I can see you are waiting for some explanation. When you accept what is, every piece of meat, every moment is the best. That is enlightenment.

## THE NATURE OF COMPASSION

Having gone beyond the mind-made opposites, you become like a deep lake. The outer situation of your life and whatever happens there, is the surface of the lake. Sometimes calm, sometimes windy and rough, according to the cycles and seasons. Deep down, however, the lake is always undisturbed. You are the whole lake, not just the surface, and you are in touch with your own depth, which remains absolutely still. You don't resist change by mentally clinging to any situation. Your inner peace does not depend on it. You abide in Being unchanging, timeless, deathless and you are no longer dependent for fulfillment or happiness on the outer world of constantly fluctuating forms. You can enjoy them, play with them, create new forms, appreciate the beauty of it all. But there will be no need to attach yourself to any of it.

思维创造了对立面，当你超越了这个对立面，你就会变成一个深深的湖泊。你生活的外在情况和生活中所发生的任何事情，都是这个湖泊的表面。随着循环和季节的变化，湖面有时平静，有时波澜起伏。然而在湖的深处，总是宁静的。你就是整个大湖，不仅仅是湖的表面而且还是湖的底部，永远都是绝对的宁静。你不会心理上执着于某种情况而去抗拒任何变化。你内心的宁静不依赖任何变化。你与本体同在——永恒、无时间性、不朽，并且你不再依赖时时变化的外在世界来获得成就或幸福。你还是会享受外在世界，在其中游戏，创造新的形式，感激美丽的一切，但是不会再执着于它们。

> When you become this detached, does it not mean that you also become remote from other human beings?
>
> 当你进入这种出离的状态时，是不是意味着你同样与他人隔绝了呢？

On the contrary. As long as you are unaware of Being, the reality of other humans will elude you, because you have not found your own. Your mind will like or dislike their form, which is not just their body but includes their mind as well. True relationship becomes possible only when there is an awareness of Being. Coming from Being, you will perceive another person's body and mind as just a screen, as it were, behind which you can feel their true reality, as you feel yours.

So, when confronted with someone else's suffering or unconscious behavior, you stay present and in touch with Being and are thus able to look beyond the form and feel the other person's radiant and pure Being through your own. At the level of Being, all suffering is recognized as an illusion. Suffering is due to identification with form. Miracles of healing sometimes occur through this realization, by awakening Being-consciousness in others if they are ready.

情况恰恰相反。如果你没有意识到本体，你就无法意识到他人的本质，因为你没有找到你自己的本质。你的思维会喜欢或不喜欢他们的形式，这包括身体形式和思维形式。只有当你有本体的意识时，真正的关系才会出现。处于本体意识之中，你会把别人的身体和思维感知成一个屏幕。在这个屏幕之后你能感受到他们的真正本质，就像你感受你自己的本质一样。所以，当你遇到某人在遭受痛苦或做出无意识的行为时，你能借由保持临在、与本体联结而看穿他们的形式，去感受他人本体光彩的纯真。在本体层面，所有的痛苦都被看成是一种幻象。痛苦是由于形式认同而产生的。有时通过唤醒别人的本体意识，就可以奇迹般地治愈痛苦。

> Is that what compassion is?
>
> 这就是慈悲的含义吗？

Yes. Compassion is the awareness of a deep bond between yourself and all creatures. But there are two sides to compassion, two sides to this bond. On the one hand, since you are still here as a physical body, you share the vulnerability and mortality of your physical form with every other human and with every living being. Next time you say “I have nothing in common with this person,” remember that you have a great deal in common: A few years from now two years or seventy years, it doesnt make much difference both of you will have become rotting corpses, then piles of dust, then nothing at all. This is a sobering and humbling realization that leaves little room for pride. Is this a negative thought? No, it is a fact. Why close your eyes to it? In that sense, there is total equality between you and every other creature.

是的。慈悲是你自己和众生之间的一种深深的联结，但是慈悲和这种联结都有两面性。一方面，由于你仍然以肉体的形式存在，你就与其他所有人一起共享着身体形式的脆弱性和必死性。下次当你说“我与这个人完全没有共同点”时，请记住，你与他有很大的共同性：几年后——两年或七十年后，你们不会有太大的区别，你们都会成为腐烂的尸体，然后化为尘土，一无所有。这个现实很残忍。这是消极的思维吗？不，不是的，这是事实。为什么不正视它呢？从这个意义上来说，你和所有人之间是完全平等的。

One of the most powerful spiritual practices is to meditate deeply on the mortality of physical forms, including your own. This is called: **Die before you die**. Go into it deeply. Your physical form is dissolving, is no more. Then a moment comes when all mind-forms or thoughts also die. Yet you are still there the divine presence that you are. Radiant, fully awake. Nothing that was real ever died, only names, forms, and illusions.

一个最强有力的灵修方法就是深入地冥想一切（包括你自己）最终都会死亡。也就是说：在你死之前就死亡，深深地走进它。你的身体形式在不断地衰弱，然后你所有的思维形式或思想内容也会跟着死亡。但是你仍然存在——你神圣的本质仍然在那里。真实的、严明的、觉醒的本质性的东西不会死亡，死亡的只是你的名字、形式和幻象。

The realization of this deathless dimension, your true nature, is the other side of compassion. On a deep feeling-level, you now recognize not only your own immortality but through your own that of every other creature as well. On the level of form, you share mortality and the precariousness of existence. On the level of Being, you share eternal, radiant life. These are the two aspects of compassion. In compassion, the seemingly opposite feelings of sadness and joy merge into one and become transmuted into a deep inner peace, This is the peace of God. It is one of the most noble feelings that humans are capable of, and it has great healing and transformative power. But true compassion, as I have just described it, is as yet rare. To have deep empathy for the suffering of another being certainly requires a high degree of consciousness but represents only one side of compassion. It is not complete. **True compassion goes beyond empathy or sympathy**. It does not happen until sadness merges with joy, the joy of Being beyond form, the joy of eternal life.

对这种不朽状态（你的自然本质）的认识是慈悲的另外一面。在一个较深的感受层面，你不仅会认识到你自己的不朽性，还会通过它认识到众生的不朽性。在形式层面，你们共同在生死与无常里存在。在本体层面，你们共享着光明的永生。这就是慈悲的两个层面。在慈悲里，表面上对立的悲伤与欢乐融为一体并转变成内心深深的宁静。这就是人类所能拥有的最高贵的情操，它有着治愈和转化的力量。但是真正的慈悲，如我刚才所描述的那样，是很稀少的。要对别人的痛苦抱有深刻的同情心当然需要高度的意识，但是这仅代表慈悲的一个方面。这是不完善的。真正的慈悲是超越同情心的。直到悲伤与欢乐——超越形式的本体喜悦，永恒生命的欢乐——结合在一起时，你才会拥有真正的慈悲。

## TOWARD A DIFFERENT ORDER OF REALITY

> I don't agree that the body needs to die. I am convinced that we can achieve physical immortality. We believe in death and thats why the body dies.
>
> 我认为身体不一定会死亡。我确信我们可以永生不死。我们相信死亡，这才是身体死亡的原因。

The body does not die because you believe in death. The body exists, or seems to, because you believe in death. Body and death are part of the same illusion, created by the egoic mode of consciousness, which has no awareness of the Source of life and sees itself as separate and constantly under threat. So it creates the illusion that you are a body, a dense, physical vehicle that is constantly under threat. 

身体不会因为你相信死亡而死亡。身体存在或看似存在，是因为你相信死亡。身体和死亡都是相同幻象的一部分，它由小我的意识模式产生，它对生命的源头没有认识，视它自己为孤立的并不断地遭受威胁。所以它创造了一种幻象：你是一个身体，一个不断遭受威胁的密集的物质形式。

To perceive yourself as a vulnerable body that was born and a little later dies, that's the illusion. Body and death: one illusion. You cannot have one without the other. You want to keep one side of the illusion and get rid of the other, but that is impossible. Either you keep all of it or you relinquish[^1] all of it.

将你自己感知成一个经历生与死的脆弱身体就是一个幻象。身体和死亡都是幻象。两者密不可分。你不可能在你的这个幻象中保持一个而摆脱另外一个。你要么全部将它当成幻象，要么将它们全部放弃。

However, you cannot escape from the body, nor do you have to. The body is an incredible misperception of your true nature. But **your true nature is concealed somewhere within that illusion, not outside it, so the body is still the only point of access to it**.

然而，你不可能从你的身体中逃脱出来，你也不需要。身体是你对你真正本质的误解。但是你真正的本质隐藏在这种幻象之中而不是在外，所以身体是进入你真正本质的唯一切入点。

If you saw an angel but mistook it for a stone statue, all you would have to do is adjust your vision and look more closely at the “stone statue,” not start looking somewhere else. You would then find that there never was a stone statue.

如果你看到了天使，却把它误认为是一块石雕，这时你所需要做的就是调整你的视角，并更为仔细地观察这块石雕，而不是向别处看。这时你就会发现那里根本没有石雕。

> If belief in death creates the body, why does an animal have a body? An animal doesn't have an ego, and it doesn't believe in death ....
>
> 如果相信死亡创造了身体，那么为什么动物有身体呢？动物不会有自我，并且它也不会相信死亡。

But it still dies, or seems to. Remember that **your perception of the world is a reflection of your state of consciousness**. You are not separate from it, and **there is no objective world out there**. Every moment, your consciousness creates the world that you inhabit. One of the greatest insights that has come out of modern physics is that of **the unity between the observer and the observed**: the person conducting the experiment—the observing consciousness—cannot be separated from the observed phenomena, and a different way of looking causes the observed phenomena to behave differently. If you believe, on a deep level, in separation and the struggle for survival, then you see that belief reflected all around you and your perceptions are governed by fear. You inhabit a world of death and of bodies fighting, killing, and devouring[^18] each other. 

它仍然会死亡或看似死亡。记住，你对世界的感知是你意识状态的一个反映。你并没有与其分离，没有一个外在的客观世界。每一刻，你的意识都在创造着你所栖身的世界。现代物理学给我们一个最大的启迪就是：观察者与被观察者的合一。观察者不能与被观察的现象分开，不同的观察角度会导致被观察对象行为的不同。如果你深信我们是孤立的，而且要生存就必须要奋斗，那么你所看到的世界就是你这个信念的反映，所有你的感知都会被恐惧所操控。你也会住在一个死亡、战斗、弱肉强食的世界。

Nothing is what it seems to be. The world that you create and see through the egoic mind may seem a very imperfect place, even a vale[^19] of tears. But **whatever you perceive is only a kind of symbol**, like an image in a dream. It is how **your consciousness interprets and interacts** with the molecular energy dance of the universe. This energy is the raw material of so-called physical reality. You see it in terms of bodies and birth and death, or as a struggle for survival. An infinite number of completely different interpretations, completely different worlds, is possible and, in fact, exists all depending on the perceiving consciousness. **Every being is a focal point of consciousness**, and every such focal point creates its own world, although all those worlds are interconnected. There is a human world, an ant world, a dolphin world, and so on. There are countless beings whose consciousness frequency is so different from yours that you are probably unaware of their existence, as they are of yours. Highly conscious beings who are aware of their **connectedness with the Source** and with each other would inhabit a world that to you would appear as a heavenly realm and yet **all worlds are ultimately one**.

没有一件事是它表面看起来的那个样子。通过小我的思维所创造的和你所见到的世界，可能看起来是一个非常不完美的地方，甚至是流泪之谷。但是你所感知到的任何东西仅仅是一个象征，就像你梦中的意象一样。你的意识就是用这种方式对宇宙的分子能量进行阐释和与之互动的。这种能量是所谓的身体本质的原材料。你以身体、生与死或为生存奋斗的方式来看这个世界。无数个完全不同的解释，完全不同的世界都是有可能的，而且实际上都是存在的，所有这些都取决于你感知的意识。每一个存在都是一个意识的聚集点，每一个聚集点都创造了一个它们自己的世界，即使这些世界都是相互联系的。地球上有人类世界、蚂蚁世界、海豚世界等，还有很多存在体，由于它们意识频率与你的不一样，你可能还未意识到它们的存在，它们也不知道你的存在。高度意识的存在 (Highly conscious beings) 会注意到它们与意识源头以及万物之间的相互联系，因此它们居住的世界对你而言就是天堂。尽管如此，最终所有的世界终极都是合一的。现在展现在我们面前的世界，很大一部分是人类小我思维的反映。恐惧成为小我幻象不可避免的结果，而这种小我幻象是由恐惧主导的世界。

**Our collective human world is largely created through the level of consciousness we call mind**. Even within the collective human world, there are vast differences, many different “sub-worlds,” depending on the perceivers or creators of their respective worlds. Since all worlds are interconnected, when collective human consciousness becomes transformed, nature and the animal kingdom will reflect that transformation. Hence the statement in the Bible that in the coming age “The lion shall lie down with the lamb.” This points to the possibility of a completely different order of reality.

我们人类世界大部分是通过某种意识水平——我们称之为思维——来创造的。甚至在我们的人类世界里面，也有许多不同的小世界，它们通过那些感知者或创造者的不同意识而创造。由于所有的世界都是相互联系的，所以当人类集体意识被改变时，自然和动物王国将会反映这种变化。因此，《圣经》说：“在未来，狮子和羊羔将会睡在一起。”这指出了一个完全不同层面的现实。

The world as it appears to us now is, as I said, largely a reflection of the egoic mind. **Fear being an unavoidable consequence of egoic delusion**, **it is a world dominated by fear**. Just as the images in a dream are symbols of inner states and feelings, so our collective reality is largely a symbolic expression of fear and of the heavy layers of negativity that have accumulated in the collective human psyche. We are not separate from our world, so when the majority of humans become free of egoic delusion, this inner change will affect all of creation. You will literally inhabit a new world. It is a shift in planetary consciousness. The strange Buddhist saying that every tree and every blade of grass will eventually become enlightened points to the same truth. 

现在展现在我们面前的世界，如我所说的，很大一部分是人类小我思维的反映。恐惧成为小我幻象不可避免的结果，而这种小我幻象是由恐惧主导的世界。就像梦中的意象是内心状态和感觉的象征一样，所以我们的集体现实很大一部分是恐惧的象征性表现，也是积累在人类灵魂中沉重的消极心态的象征性表现。我们与世界不是分离开的，所以当绝大部分人从小我幻象中解放出来时，这种内在的变化将会影响所有的生物。你将会实实在在地居住在一个新的世界之中。这将是全球意识的转变。佛教徒说所有的树和草最终将会开悟，说的也是这个真理。

According to St. Paul, **the whole of creation is waiting for humans to become enlightened**. That is how I interpret his saying that “The created universe is waiting with eager expectation for God's sons to be revealed.” St. Paul goes on to say that all of creation will become redeemed through this: “Up to the present ... the whole created universe in all its parts groans as if in the pangs[^20] of childbirth.” What is being born is a new consciousness and, as its inevitable reflection, a new world. This is also foretold in the New Testament Book of Revelation: “Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away.”

圣保罗说：所有的生物都在等待人类的开悟。我将他的话理解成：“宇宙在急切地等待上帝之子的出现。”圣保罗还说：“直到现在，整个宇宙像分娩一样痛苦地呻吟。”所有生物就在等待这一刻而得到救赎，而即将诞生的是一个崭新的意识，以及新意识所势必反映出来的新世界。

But don't confuse cause and effect. **Your primary task is not to seek salvation[^12] through creating a better world, but to awaken out of identification with form**. You are then no longer bound to this world, this level of reality. You can feel your roots in the Unmanifested and so are free of attachment to the manifested world. **You can still enjoy the passing pleasures of this world, but there is no fear of loss anymore, so you don't need to cling to them**. Although you can enjoy sensory pleasures, the craving for sensory experience is gone, as is the constant search for fulfillment through psychological gratification, through feeding the ego. You are in touch with something infinitely greater than any pleasure, greater than any manifested thing.

请别把因果混淆起来。你主要的任务不是通过创造一个更好的世界而获得拯救，而是从形式认同当中解放出来。这样你就不会受限于这个世界和它这个层次的现实。你就能在未显化状态中感觉到你的根，因而你也就不会执着于显化世界。你仍然可以享受这个世界上稍纵即逝的欢乐，但是你不会再害怕失去，所以你不需要依赖它们。虽然你能享受感官上的欢乐，但是你不会再渴望感官体验，因为这种渴望是经过心理满足和“喂养”自我而持续寻求成就的。你会接触到一些比任何的欢乐、所有显化出来的东西更无限伟大的东西。

In a way, you then don't need the world anymore. You don't even need it to be different from the way it is.

这样，你就不再需要这个世界了。你甚至不需要它有所改变了。

It is only at this point that you begin to make a real contribution toward bringing about a better world, toward creating a different order of reality. It is only at this point that you are able to feel true compassion and to help others at the level of cause. **Only those who have transcended the world can bring about a better world**.

只有这样，你才会开始为创造一个更好的世界做出贡献，为创造一种不同层次的现实做出贡献。只有这样，你才能感受到真正的慈悲，才能真正地帮助别人。只有那些超越世界的人才能创造一个更好的世界。

You may remember that we talked about the dual nature of true compassion, which is awareness of a common bond of shared mortality and immortality. At this deep level, compassion becomes healing in the widest sense. In that state, your healing influence is primarily based not on doing but on being. Everybody you come in contact with will be touched by your presence and affected by the peace that you emanate, whether they are conscious of it or not. When you are fully present and people around you manifest unconscious behavior, you won't feel the need to react to it, so you don't give it any reality. Your peace is so vast and deep that anything that is not peace disappears into it as if it had never existed. This breaks the karmic cycle of action and reaction. Animals, trees, flowers will feel your peace and respond to it. You teach through being, through demonstrating the peace of God. You become the “light of the world,” an emanation of pure consciousness, and so you eliminate suffering on the level of cause. You eliminate unconsciousness from the world.

你可能记得我谈到过慈悲的二元性，它是对必死性和不朽性之间联结的觉知。在这个更深的层次上，慈悲变得具有最广泛的疗愈作用。在这种状态中，你疗愈的影响力不是来自你的行为，而是来自你的本体。不管他们是否意识到了这一点，与你接触的每一个人都会被你的临在意识和你散发出来的宁静所影响。当你完全临在而你周围的人表现出来的却都是无意识行为时，你不会对他们做出任何反应，因为你不认为那是真实的。你宁静的影响力如此广阔、深远，以至于那些不处于宁静状态的东西都会消融于其中，就像它们没有存在过一样。动物、树木、花草将会感受到你的宁静并对此做出反应。你通过你的存在，通过展现上帝的宁静来教导大家。你变成了散发出纯意识的世界之光，进而在“因”的方面消除了痛苦。你也从这个世界上消除了无意识。

This doesn't mean that you may not also teach through doing for example, by pointing out how to disidentify from the mind, recognize unconscious patterns within oneself, and so on. But who you are is always a more vital teaching and a more powerful transformer of the world than what you say, and more essential even than what you do. Furthermore, to recognize the primacy of Being, and thus work on the level of cause, does not exclude the possibility that your compassion may simultaneously manifest on the level of doing and of effect, by alleviating suffering whenever you come across it. When a hungry person asks you for bread and you have some, you will give it. But as you give the bread, even though your interaction may only be very brief, what really matters is this moment of shared Being, of which the bread is only a symbol. A deep healing takes place within it. In that moment, there is no giver, no receiver.

但是，这不是说你不会通过你的行为来教导别人，比如说，指导别人如何从思维认同中摆脱出来，认出自己的无意识模式等。但是你的本质比你所说的、所做的更为重要。认识到本体的重要性，而在“因”上面下功夫并不是要排除慈悲表现在你行为上的可能性。当你遇到一个饥饿的人向你要面包，而你又有时，你将会给予。但是当你给出面包时，即使你们的互动只是片刻间，真正重要的是去分享存在，而面包只是一个象征。在这过程中会有更深层的疗愈发生。那一刻，就不会有施舍者，也不会有接受者。

> But there shouldn't be any hunger and starvation in the first place. How can we create a better world without tackling evils such as hunger and violence first?
>
> 但是应该是没有饥饿和饥荒的呀！我们应该如何去创造一个不存在饥饿、暴力等邪恶事情的更美好的世界呢？

**All evils are the effect of unconsciousness**. **You can alleviate the effects of unconsciousness, but you cannot eliminate them unless you eliminate their cause**. True change happens within, not without.

所有的邪恶都是无意识的果。你可以减少无意识所带来的果，但是你不能消除它们，除非你消除了它们的因，因为真正的变化发生在内在，不是外在。

If you feel called upon to alleviate suffering in the world, that is a very noble[^21] thing to do, but **remember not to focus exclusively on the outer**; otherwise, you will encounter frustration and despair. **Without a profound change in human consciousness, the world's suffering is a bottomless pit**. So don't let your compassion become one-sided. Empathy with someone else's pain or lack and a desire to help need to be balanced with a deeper realization of the eternal nature of all life and the ultimate illusion of all pain. Then let your peace flow into whatever you do and you will be **working on the levels of effect and cause simultaneously**.

如果你觉得要用爱的召唤去减轻世界的痛苦——这是一个崇高的事业——那么请记住不要把注意力都集中在外部事情上，否则你将会遇到挫折和绝望。如果没有人类意识的深刻变化，世界所遭受的痛苦将是一个无底洞。所以不要使你的同情心变得片面，在对别人痛苦、匮乏的同情、帮助别人的愿望，以及对所有生命的永恒本质，乃至所有痛苦的最终幻象深刻了解之间，请找到平衡。让你内心的宁静流入你所做的任何一件事情上，这样你就会在因和果上同时发挥作用。

This also applies if you are supporting a movement designed to **stop deeply unconscious humans from destroying themselves, each other, and the planet**, or from continuing to inflict[^22] dreadful suffering on other sentient[^23] beings. Remember. Just as you cannot fight the darkness, so **you cannot fight unconsciousness**. If you try to do so, the polar opposites will become strengthened and more deeply entrenched[^24]. You will become identified with one of the polarities, you will create an “enemy,” and so be drawn into unconsciousness yourself. Raise awareness by disseminating information, or at the most, practice passive resistance. But make sure that you carry no resistance within, no hatred, no negativity. “Love your enemies,” said Jesus, which, of course, means “have no enemies.” 

当你在阻止完全无意识的人毁坏他们自己、别人、地球以及将痛苦加诸公众之上时，这种做法同样有效。记住：就像你不能与黑暗抗争一样，你也不能与无意识抗争。如果你试着这样做，事物对立的另一面就会得到加强。你就会被其中一个对立面所认同，你会创造一个敌人，并把你自己拖入无意识状态之中。无论如何请确保你的内心没有抗拒，没有仇恨，没有消极力量。耶稣说：“去爱你的敌人。”这句话当然是“不要树敌”的意思。

Once you get involved in working on the level of effect, it is all too easy to lose yourself in it. Stay alert and very, very present. **The causal level needs to remain your primary focus, the teaching of enlightenment your main purpose, and peace your most precious gift to the world**.

一旦你在“果”的层面下功夫，就很容易让自己迷失其中。你要保持警觉，要深深进入临在状态。但你仍需以“因”的层面作为首要的焦点，以开悟的教化作为主要目的，以和平作为你给予世界的最珍贵的礼物。
