# Ch10 THE MEANING OF SURRENDER

## ACCEPTANCE OF THE NOW

> You mentioned “surrender” a few times. I don't like that idea. It sounds somewhat fatalistic. If we always accept the way things are, we are not going to make any effort to improve them. It seems to me what progress is all about, both in our personal lives and collectively, is not to accept the limitations of the present but to strive to go beyond them and create something better. If we hadn't done this, we would still be living in caves. How do you reconcile surrender with changing things and getting things done?

> 你几次提到过“臣服”。我不喜欢这个观点，它听起来就像宿命论一样。如果我们一直接受现实，我们就不会努力去改善它。在我看来，在个人生活和集体方面，进步的含义就是不去接受现实的局限，而是努力超越现实，把事情变得更好。如果我们人类不这么做，我们今天仍会住在洞穴里。我们应怎样在改善现状、完成工作以及臣服之间找到平衡呢？

To some people, surrender may have negative connotations, implying defeat, giving up, failing to rise to the challenges of life, becoming lethargic, and so on. True surrender, however, is something entirely different. It does not mean to passively put up with whatever situation you find yourself in and to do nothing about it. Nor does it mean to cease making plans or initiating positive action.

对于有些人来说，臣服可能很消极，意味着失败、放弃、无法面对生活中的挑战、迟钝、退缩等。然而，真正的臣服是与这些完全不同的。它不是说消极地去忍受你生活中出现的任何情况，不做任何努力，也不是说停止制订计划或采取积极的行动。

Surrender is the simple but profound wisdom of yielding to rather than opposing the flow of life. The only place where you can experience the flow of life is the Now, so to surrender is to accept the present moment unconditionally and without reservation. It is to relinquish inner resistance to what is. Inner resistance is to say “no” to what is, through mental judgment and emotional negativity. It becomes particularly pronounced when things “go wrong,” which means that there is a gap between the demands or rigid expectations of your mind and what is. That is the pain gap. If you have lived long enough, you will know that things “go wrong” quite often. It is precisely at those times that surrender needs to be practiced if you want to eliminate pain and sorrow from your life. Acceptance of What is immediately frees you from mind identification and thus reconnects you with Being. Resistance is the mind.

臣服是一种顺随生命流动，而不逆流而上的简单而又深刻的智慧。你唯一能体会到生命流动的地方就是在当下时刻，所以臣服就是无条件、无保留地接受当下时刻。它是放弃对当下的内心抗拒。内心抗拒就是通过心理批判和消极的情绪，对当下时刻说“不”。当事情出错的时候，即你思维的要求和期望与现实之间有差距时，内心抗拒就会变得尤其明显。如果你年纪够大，就会知道事情出错是很正常的。如果你要从生活中消除痛苦和悲伤，这就是练习臣服的最终时刻。接受当下的现实，你就会立即从你的思维认同中解放出来，从而与你的本体相联结。抗拒就是思维。

Surrender is a purely inner phenomenon. It does not mean that on the outer level you cannot take action and change the situation. In fact, it is not the overall situation that you need to accept when you surrender, but just the tiny segment called the Now.

臣服是一种纯内心现象。它不是说在你的外在不采取行动并改变状况。事实上，当你臣服时，你需要接受的不是所有的情况，而是被称为当下的那一小部分。

For example, if you were stuck in the mud somewhere, you wouldn't say. “Okay, I resign myself to being stuck in the mud.” Resignation is not surrender. You don't need to accept an undesirable or unpleasant life situation. Nor do you need to deceive yourself and say that there is nothing wrong with being stuck in the mud. No. You recognize fully that you want to get out of it. You then narrow your attention down to the present moment without mentally labeling it in any way. This means that there is no judgment of the Now. Therefore, there is no resistance, no emotional negativity. You accept the “isness” of this moment. Then you take action and do all that you can to get out of the mud. Such action I call positive action. It is far more effective than negative action, which arises out of anger, despair, or frustration. Until you achieve the desired result, you continue to practice surrender by refraining from labeling the Now.

比如，当你陷入泥沼中时，你不会说：“好，我认了，我就让自己陷入泥沼中吧。”听任事态发展不是臣服。你不需要接受不开心的生活情境，也不需要欺骗你自己说：“陷入泥沼中没什么不好的。”不，你完全认识到你应该从泥沼中脱身而出，然后将注意力集中在当下时刻，而不给它贴心理标签。这就是说对当下没有批判，也就没有抗拒，没有消极情感。接受当下的现实，然后采取行动，尽最大的努力从泥沼中摆脱出来。这种行动叫积极的行动，它比产生于愤怒、绝望或挫折的消极行为更具威力。不对当下时刻贴任何心理标签，不断地臣服于当下，直到你取得理想的结果。

Let me give you a visual analogy to illustrate the point I am making. You are walking along a path at night, surrounded by a thick fog. But you have a powerful flashlight that cuts through the fog and creates a narrow, dear space in front of you. The fog is your life situation, which includes past and future; the flashlight is your conscious presence; the dear space is the Now.

让我来举一个很形象的例子。在一个浓雾弥漫的夜晚，你一个人独自走在路上。但是你有一个光亮很强的手电筒，在浓雾中开辟了一个狭窄而明亮的空间。浓雾就是你的生活情境，它包含着过去和未来；手电就是你的意识临在；明亮的空间就是你的当下时刻。

Non-surrender hardens your psychological form, the shell of the ego, and so creates a strong sense of separateness. The world around you and people in particular come to be perceived as threatening. The unconscious compulsion to 198 destroy others through judgment arises, as does the need to compete and dominate. Even nature becomes your enemy and your perceptions and interpretations are governed by fear. The mental disease that we call paranoia is only a slightly more acute form of this normal but dysfunctional state of consciousness.

不臣服会让你的心理形式——小我的外壳更加顽固，所以创造了一种很强的孤立感。你周围的世界，尤其是你周围的人就会被你视为一种威胁。经由批判而产生想去毁坏其他人或其他物的无意识的冲动，还有竞争和操控的欲望，就会产生。甚至大自然也会变成你的敌人，你的认知和解释都被恐惧所控制。被我们称为偏执狂的心理疾病比起这种正常但又充满障碍的意识状态，只稍微严重了一些。

Not only your psychological form but also your physical form your body becomes hard and rigid through resistance. Tension arises in different parts of the body, and the body as a whole contracts. The free flow of life energy through the body, which is essential for its healthy functioning, is greatly restricted. Bodywork and certain forms of physical therapy can be helpful in restoring this flow, but unless you practice surrender in your everyday life, those things can only give temporary symptom relief since the cause the resistance pattern has not been dissolved.

除了你的心理形式，你的身体也会因为抗拒变得古板和僵硬。身体的各个部位会产生紧张感，整个身体都会收缩。对健康极为重要的生命能量的自由流动就会受到限制。一些治疗身体的方法可能对恢复这种能量流动有所帮助，但是除非你在日常生活中练习臣服于当下，否则这些方式只会起到表面作用。因为它的根本原因——抗拒的模式——没有被消除。

There is something within you that remains unaffected by the transient circumstances that make up your life situation, and only through surrender do you have access to it. It is your life, your very Being which exists eternally in the timeless realm of the present. Finding this life is “the one thing that is needed” that Jesus talked about.

你体内的有些东西永远不会被构成你生活情境的阶段性环境所影响，但是只有通过臣服你才能接触到它。它就是生命，你的本体——存在于当下时刻的无时间领域，而“找到这种生命”，就是耶稣说的“你唯一需要做的事”。

If you find your life situation unsatisfactory or even intolerable, it is only by surrendering first that you can break the unconscious resistance pattern that perpetuates that situation.

如果你发现你的生活情境令你不满意或无法忍耐，只有通过臣服，你才能打破充满在你生活情境中的无意识的抗拒。

Surrender is perfectly compatible with taking action, initiating change or achieving goals. But in the surrendered state a totally different energy, a different quality, flows into your doing. Surrender reconnects you with the source-energy of Being, and if your doing is infused with Being, it becomes a joyful celebration of life energy that takes you more deeply into the Now. Through nonresistance, the quality of your consciousness and, therefore, the quality of whatever you are doing or creating is enhanced immeasurably. The results will then look after themselves and reflect that quality. We could call this “surrendered action.” It is not work as we have known it for thousands of years. As more humans awaken, the word work is going to disappear from our vocabulary, and perhaps a new word will be created to replace it.

臣服与采取行动、寻求变化或达到目标是完全一致的。但是在臣服状态中，一种完全不同的能量会流入你所做的事情之中，臣服让你和本体的能量源头重新联结。如果你所做的事是与本体相联结的，那么它将会变成你生命能量的一场庆典，并将带你更深入当下。通过不抗拒，你意识的质量、做事或创造的质量将会得到极大的提高。臣服的效果会自然出现并反映出这些质量。我们可以称它为“臣服行动”。它不再是我们几千年来惯称的工作。随着越来越多的人觉醒，工作这个词将会从我们的词典中消失，或许将会被一个新的词所替代。

It is the quality of your consciousness at this moment that is the main determinant of what kind of future you will experience, so to surrender is the most important thing you can do to bring about positive change. Any action you take is secondary. No truly positive action can arise out of an unsurrendered state of consciousness.

你会经历什么样的未来，主要决定于你当下时刻意识的质量。所以臣服是引发积极变化的关键所在。你所采取的任何行动都是次要的。离开了臣服的意识状态，就不会产生任何的积极行动。

> I can see that if I am in a situation that is unpleasant or unsatisfactory and I completely accept the moment as it is, there will be no suffering or unhappiness. I will have risen above it. But I still can't quite see where the energy or motivation for taking action and bringing about change would come from if there isn't a certain amount of dissatisfaction.
>
> 我知道，当我处于一种不开心或令我不满意的状态时，如果完全接受事实，我就不会痛苦或不开心。但是，我仍然疑惑，如果没有一定程度的不满意，那么采取行动和做出变化的能量或动力从何处产生呢？

In the state of surrender, you see very clearly what needs to be done, and you take action, doing one thing at a time and focusing on one thing at a time. Learn from nature: See how everything gets accomplished and how the miracle of life unfolds without dissatisfaction or unhappiness. Thats why Jesus said: “Look at the lilies, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin.”

在臣服状态中，你会清楚地看到你需要做什么，然后采取行动，一次只做一件事，一次将注意力集中在一件事上。从大自然中学会这个道理：观察万事是如何运作的，生命的奇迹是如何在没有不满或不开心的状态下展现在你面前的。这就是“看看这些百合花是如何生长的；它们不耕不纺却过得好好的”的原因。

If your overall situation is unsatisfactory or unpleasant, separate out this instant and surrender to what is. Thats the flashlight cutting through the fog. Your state of consciousness then ceases to be controlled by external conditions. You are no longer coming from reaction and resistance. Then look at the specifics of the situation. Ask yourself, “Is there anything I can do to change the situation, improve it, or remove myself from it?” If so, you take appropriate action. Focus not on the 100 things that you will or may have to do at some future time but on the one thing that you can do now. This doesn't mean you should not do any planning. It may well be that planning is the one thing you can do now. But make sure you don't start to run “mental movies,” project yourself into the future, and so lose the Now. Any action you take may not bear fruit immediately. Until it does do not resist what is. If there is no action you can take, and you cannot remove yourself from the situation either, then use the situation to make you go more deeply into surrender, more deeply into the Now, more deeply into Being. When you enter this timeless dimension of the present, change often comes about in strange ways without the need for a great deal of doing on your part. Life becomes helpful and cooperative. If inner factors such as fear, guilt, or inertia prevented you from taking action, they will dissolve in the light of your conscious presence.

如果所有的状况都令你不满意或不开心，请你立即将当下这一刻从那些状况中分离出来，向事实臣服。它就是穿越浓雾的手电筒。这样你的意识状态就不会被你的外部状况所控制。你就不会有反应，也不会去抗拒。

然后，请看看你的生活情境，试着问你自己：“我可不可以做些事情来改变这种状况，改善它或离开它呢？”如果可以，你就会采取合适的行动。不要将注意力集中在未来需要做的一百件事情上，而要将注意力集中在此刻可以做的一件事情上。这不是说你不需要做任何计划，或许这个计划就是你现在需要做的一件事。我所说的是请不要开始播放心理电影，把你自己投身于未来之中，从而丢失了当下。你现在所采取的行动也许不会立即有结果，但在结果出现前，请接纳当前的事实。如果你无法采取任何行动，也无法从你的状况中离开，那么请你臣服，更深地进入当下时刻以及本体意识。当你进入本体的无时间状态时，你有时不需要做很多事情，变化就会以意想不到的方式出现。生活会帮助你，并与你合作。如果内在因素（比如恐惧、愧疚或惰性）阻止你采取行动，它们也将会消失在你的本体意识之光中。

Do not confuse surrender with an attitude of “I can't be bothered anymore” or “I just don't care anymore.” If you look at it closely, you will find that such an attitude is tainted with negativity in the form of hidden resentment and so is not surrender at all but masked resistance. As you surrender, direct your attention inward to check if there is any trace of resistance left inside you. Be very alert when you do so; otherwise, a pocket of resistance may continue to hide in some dark corner in the form of a thought or an unacknowledged emotion.

请别把臣服与“我不愿再烦恼了”或“我不在乎”这种态度混淆在一起。如果你仔细观察，就会发现这种态度与消极心态有关，有隐藏的怨恨在其中，所以它根本不是臣服，而是戴着面具的抗拒。如果你臣服，你就会将注意力集中在你的内在，并检查那里是否有抗拒的存在。请保持警惕，或许有许多抗拒会以思维或未被辨认出来的情绪形式隐藏在你的内心黑暗处。

## FROM MIND ENERGY TO SPIRITUAL ENERGY

> Letting go of resistance is easier said than done. I still don't see clearly how to let go. If you say it is by surrendering, the question remains: “How?”
>
> 放下抗拒，说起来简单，做起来难。我仍然不清楚该如何放下抗拒。如果你说通过臣服来放下抗拒，那么问题是：“怎样做？”

Start by acknowledging that there is resistance. Be there when it happens, when the resistance arises. Observe how your mind creates it, how it labels the situation, yourself, or others. Look at the thought process involved. Feel the energy of the emotion. By witnessing the resistance, you will see that it serves no purpose. By focusing all your attention on the Now, the unconscious resistance is made conscious, and that is the end of it. You cannot be conscious and unhappy, conscious and in negativity. Negativity, unhappiness, or suffering in whatever form means that there is resistance, and resistance is always unconscious.

首先承认你的内心有抗拒。观察你的思维是如何创造抗拒，如何为你的生活状况、你自己或他人贴标签的。关注思维的过程，感受情绪的能量。通过观察抗拒，你将会明白它毫无用处。将注意力集中在当下，无意识的抗拒就会变成有意识。你不可能既有意识又不开心，既有意识又有消极心态。

任何形式的消极心态、不开心或痛苦都意味着有抗拒的存在，而抗拒通常是无意识的。

> Surely I can be conscious of my unhappy feelings?
>
> 我当然对不开心的感觉有意识了？

Would you choose unhappiness? If you did not choose it, how did it arise? What is its purpose? Who is keeping it alive? You say that you are conscious of your unhappy feelings, but the truth is that you are identified with them and keep the process alive through compulsive thinking. All that is unconscious. If you were conscious, that is to say totally present in the Now, all negativity would dissolve almost instantly. It could not survive in your presence. It can only survive in your absence. Even the pain-body cannot survive for long in your presence. You keep your unhappiness alive by giving it time. That is its lifeblood. Remove time through intense present-moment awareness and it dies. But do you want it to die? Have you truly had enough? Who would you be without it?

你会选择不开心吗？如果你没选择它，它是怎么产生的？它的目的是什么？谁让它持续下去的？你说你能意识到不开心的感觉，但事实是你对这些感觉认同了，并不由自主地在让这个过程持续下去。所有的这些都是无意识。如果你有意识，也就是说你完全进入当下时刻，那么所有消极的心态就会立即消失。它们无法在你临在的意识中生存。它们只能在你无意识的状态中生存。痛苦之身无法在你临在的意识状态中存活很久。给痛苦时间，会让它持续下去，时间就是它的生命血液。用你强烈的临在意识去除时间，它就会消亡。但是你要它消亡吗？你真的受够了吗？如果没有它，你将会是谁？

Until you practice surrender, the spiritual dimension is something you read about, talk about, get excited about, write books about, think about, believe in or don't, as the case may be. It makes no difference. Not until you surrender does it become a living reality in your life. When you do, the energy that you emanate and which then runs your life is of a much higher vibrational frequency than the mind energy that still runs our world the energy that created the existing social, political, and economic structures of our civilization, and which also continuously perpetuates itself through our educational systems and the media. Through surrender, spiritual energy comes into this world. It creates no suffering for yourself, for other humans, or any other life form on the planet. Unlike mind energy, it does not pollute the earth, and it is not subject to the law of polarities, which dictates that nothing can exist without its opposite, that there can be no good without bad. Those who run on mind energy, which is still the vast majority of the Earth's population, remain unaware of the existence of spiritual energy. It belongs to a different order of reality and will create a different world when a sufficient number of humans enter the surrendered state and so become totally free of negativity. If the Earth is to survive, this will be the energy of those who inhabit it.

当你臣服时，你散发出来的能量振动频率，要比仍然控制我们世界的思维能量的振动频率高得多——思维能量创造了现存的政治、经济和社会结构，并通过我们的教育体制和媒体不断地扩散。通过臣服，灵性能量就会来到我们这个世界。有了它，你就不会为你自己、为他人、为地球上的其他生物创造任何痛苦。不像思维能量，它不会污染地球，它不会受限于两极定律，即任何事物都是有对立面的，也就是没有恶就没有善。那些被思维控制的人仍然占世界人口的绝大部分，他们仍然没有意识到精神能量的存在。这种精神能量属于不同层次的现实，当足够多的人进入了臣服的状态，并完全由消极状态中释放出来之时，它将会创造一个截然不同的世界。如果地球要持续生存下去的话，居住在它之上的人就需要有这种能量。

Jesus referred to this energy when he made his famous prophetic statement in the Sermon on the Mount: “Blessed are the gentle; they shall have the earth for their possession.” It is a silent but intense presence that dissolves the unconscious patterns of the mind. They may still remain active for a while, but they won't run your life anymore. The external conditions that were being resisted also tend to shift or dissolve quickly through surrender. It is a powerful transformer of situations and people. If conditions do not shift immediately, your acceptance of the Now enables you to rise above them. Either way, you are free.

那些无意识的思维模式可能在短时间内仍然很活跃，但是它们不会再次控制你的生活。你曾经所抗拒的外在情境也会发生变化，并在臣服状态中很快消失。它是情境和人的有力工具。如果情况没有立即发生变化，你对当下时刻的接受就会使你得以超越它们。不管是以上情况的哪一种，你都自由了！

## SURRENDER IN PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS

> What about people who want to use me, manipulate or control me? Am I to surrender to them?
>
> 如果有人要利用、操纵或控制我，我该怎么办？我要向他们臣服吗？

They are cut off from Being, so they unconsciously attempt to get energy and power from you. It is true that only an unconscious person will try to use or manipulate others, but it is equally true that only an unconscious person can be used and manipulated. If you resist or fight unconscious behavior in others, you become unconscious yourself. But surrender doesn't mean that you allow yourself to be used by unconscious people. Not at all. It is perfectly possible to say “no” firmly and clearly to a person or to walk away from a situation and be in a state of complete inner nonresistance at the same time. When you say “no” to a person or a situation, let it come not from reaction but from insight, from a clear realization of what is right or not right for you at that moment. Let it be a nonreactive “no,” a high-quality “no,” a “no” that is free of all negativity and so creates no further suffering.

他们没有本体的意识，所以他们无意识地想从你那获取能量和力量。实际上，只有无意识的人才会企图利用或操控他人，但是也只有无意识的人才会被别人利用或操控。如果你抗拒或反抗别人的无意识行为，你自己也会变得无意识。但是臣服不是说你允许那些无意识的人利用你。绝对不是。你完全可以坚定地对那个人说“不”，或者离开那种情况，并同时进入内心的完全无抗拒状态。当你对一个人或一个情境说“不”时，让它产生于你对是与非的清楚了解和你的洞见，而不是你的反应。让它成为一个非反应的“不”，高质量的“不”，一个不带任何消极情绪的“不”，这样它就不会创造更多的痛苦。

> I am in a situation at work that is unpleasant. I have tried to surrender to it, but I find it impossible. A lot of resistance keeps coming up.
>
> 工作中的一个情况让我很不开心，我也试着向它臣服，但是我发现那不可能。我的心中充满了抗拒的情绪。

If you cannot surrender, take action immediately. Speak up or do something to bring about a change in the situation or remove yourself from it. Take responsibility for your life. Do not pollute your beautiful, radiant inner Being nor the Earth with negativity. Do not give unhappiness in any form whatsoever a dwelling place inside you.

如果你不能臣服，请你立即采取行动：说出来或做一些事情来改变这种状况，或者离开它。请对你的生命负责。别用消极心态污染了你美丽的内在和这个地球。请不要让任何形式的不开心在你内心中生存。

If you cannot take action, for example if you are in prison, then you have two choices left: resistance or surrender. Bondage or inner freedom from external conditions. Suffering or inner peace. 

如果你无法采取行动，比如当你在监狱中时，那你有两个选择：抗拒或臣服；被束缚或不依赖于外在环境而获得内心自由；承受痛苦或享受内心的宁静。

> Is nonresistance also to be practiced in the external conduct of our lives, such as nonresistance to violence, or is it something that just concerns our inner life?
>
> 对外在行为我们也要采取非抗拒的形式吗？比如不抗拒暴力，或是抗拒仅仅与我们的内在生命有关？

You only need to be concerned with the inner aspect. That is primary. Of course, that will also transform the conduct of your outer life, your relationships, and so on.

你只需要关注你的内心状态，这是主要的。当然，这将会改变你外部生活的行为、你与别人的关系等。

Your relationships will be changed profoundly by surrender. If you can never accept what is, by implication you will not be able to accept anybody the way they are. You will judge, criticize, label, reject, or attempt to change people.

通过臣服，你与别人的关系将会得到巨大的改变。如果你总是不能接受事实，就意味着你不会接受任何本然的面目。你将会批判、批评、标记、拒绝或试图改变他人。

Furthermore, if you continuously make the Now into a means to an end in the future, you will also make every person you encounter or relate with into a means to an end. The relationship the human being is then of secondary importance to you, or of no importance at all. What you can get out of the relationship is primary be it material gain, a sense of power, physical pleasure, or some form of ego gratification.

如果你一直把当下视为达到未来目标的一种手段的话，你也会把你碰到或与你相关的人当成达到你目标的一个工具，那么你们的关系、那个人，对你而言就是次要的或根本不重要的了。在这种情况下，你能从这段关系中得到什么才是最重要的——也许是物质的收获、权力感、肉体的欢愉或其他形式的小我的满足。

Let me illustrate how surrender can work in relationships. When you become involved in an argument or some conflict situation, perhaps with a partner or someone close to you, start by observing how defensive you become as your own position is attacked, or feel the force of your own aggression as you attack the other person's position. Observe the attachment to your views and opinions. Feel the mental-emotional energy behind your need to be right and make the other person wrong. Thats the energy of the egoic mind. You make it conscious by acknowledging it, by feeling it as fully as possible. Then one day, in the middle of an argument, you will suddenly realize that you have a choice, and you may decide to drop your own reaction just to see what happens. You surrender. I don't mean dropping the reaction just verbally by saying “Okay, you are right,” with a look on your face that says, “I am above all this childish unconsciousness.” Thats just displacing the resistance to another level, with the egoic mind still in charge, claiming superiority. I am speaking of letting go of the entire mental-emotional energy field inside you that was fighting for power. The ego is cunning, so you have to be very alert, very present, and totally honest with yourself to see whether you have truly relinquished your identification with a mental position and so freed yourself from your mind. If you suddenly feel very light, clear and deeply at peace, that is an unmistakable sign that you have truly surrendered. Then observe what happens to the other person's mental position as you no longer energize it through resistance. When identification with mental positions is out of the way, true communication begins.

现在让我来阐述一下臣服在人际关系中是如何发挥作用的。当你与别人发生争论或冲突时（也许是你的伴侣或你亲近的人），首先请观察当你被攻击时，你是如何进行防卫的，或当你攻击别人时，你是如何展开进攻的。观察你对自己观点和意见的执着。请感觉你好胜心理背后的心理——情绪能量。这是一种小我的思维能量。通过觉知它、感受它，你将会使自己变得有意识。然后在某天，当你与别人争论时，你将会突然意识到你还有一个选择，并决定放弃你的反应——仅看看接下来会发生什么事。这时你臣服了。放弃反应不是指仅口头上说“好，你是对的”，脸上却写着“我才不屑于你这种幼稚的无意识之举”。这种口是心非的反应，只是把抗拒放置在另一个层面，小我思维仍然占主导地位，占绝对的优势。真正的臣服是放下整个争斗的心理——情绪的内在能量场。

小我非常狡猾，所以请你一定要保持警惕，非常临在并诚实地观察你是否真正地放弃了你的思维认同。如果你突然感觉到非常轻松、清晰和宁静，那么，这毫无疑问就是你已经真正地臣服了的信号。然后再观察另外一个人的反应。当思维认同被放弃时，真正的交流就开始了。

> What about nonresistance in the face of violence, aggression, and the like?
>
> 面对暴力、侵略之类的行为时，不抗拒是什么意思？

Nonresistance doesn't necessarily mean doing nothing. All it means is that any “doing” becomes nonreactive. Remember the deep wisdom underlying the practice of Eastern martial arts: don't resist the opponents force. Yield to overcome.

不抗拒并不是说不采取任何行动。它是指你做的所有事情都不是由反应引起的。记住，东方武术中深藏的智慧：因势利导，以柔克刚。

Having said that, “doing nothing” when you are in a state of intense presence is a very powerful transformer and healer of situations and people. In Taoism, there is a term called wu wei, which is usually translated as “actionless activity” or “sitting quietly doing nothing.” In ancient China, this was regarded as one of the highest achievements or virtues. It is radically different from inactivity in the ordinary state of consciousness, or rather unconsciousness, which stems from fear, inertia, or indecision. The real “doing nothing” implies inner nonresistance and intense alertness.

我说过，当你处于强烈的临在状态中时，“无为”是转化和疗愈个人的一个强有力的工具。在道教中，有“无为”这个词，它通常被理解成“无行动的行动”或“无行动地安静地坐着”。在古代中国，这被看成是一个最高的成就或美德。它与普通意识状态或无意识状态中的不采取任何行动有着很大的区别。后者源于恐惧、惰性或优柔寡断。真正的“无为”意味着内心的不抗拒和高度的警惕。

On the other hand, if action is required, you will no longer react from your conditioned mind, but you will respond to the situation out of your conscious presence. In that state, your mind is free of concepts, including the concept of nonviolence. So who can predict what you will do? The ego believes that in your resistance lies your strength, whereas in truth resistance cuts you off from Being, the only place of true power. Resistance is weakness and fear masquerading as strength. What the ego sees as weakness is your Being in its purity, innocence, and power. What it sees as strength is weakness. So the ego exists in a continuous resistance-mode and plays counterfeit roles to cover up your “weakness,” which in truth is your power. Until there is surrender, unconscious role-playing constitutes a large part of human interaction. In surrender, you no longer need ego defenses and false masks. You become very simple, very real. “Thats dangerous,” says the ego. “You'll get hurt. You'll become vulnerable.” What the ego doesn't know, of course, is that only through the letting go of resistance, through becoming “vulnerable,” can you discover your true and essential invulnerability.

如果需要采取行动，你的行动将不会是对你的思维的反射，而是从有意识的临在中对情况做出反应。在这种状态下，你的思维中没有任何概念，包括非暴力概念。所以谁会预测得到你将会做什么呢？

小我认为你的力量隐藏在你的抗拒之中；而事实上，抗拒使你与力量的真正源头——本体相脱离。抗拒是伪装成力量的恐惧和懦弱。小我视为懦弱的，事实是你最纯净、无邪和有力量的本体；而它视为力量的其实就是懦弱。所以，小我存在于无数的抗拒模式中，它起着反作用来掩盖你的“懦弱”——而实际上这种“懦弱”却是你真正的力量之所在。

在你臣服之前，无意识的角色扮演会在很大程度上影响着人类的互动。在臣服状态中，你不再需要自我辩护和虚假的面具。你会变得非常简单、非常真实。小我说，“这是很危险的”，“你将会受到伤害，你将会变得脆弱”。但小我不知道的是：只有通过臣服，放弃抗拒，通过变得“脆弱”，你才会发现你真正的、关键的不可摧残的本质。

## TRANSFORMING ILLNESS INTO ENLIGHTENMENT

> If someone is seriously ill and completely accepts their condition and surrenders to the illness, would they not have given up their will to get back to health? The determination to fight the illness would not be there any more, would it?
>
> 如果某人得了重病并完全接受事实和向疾病臣服，他们就会放弃他们重返健康的愿望吗？这样与疾病抗争的决心就不再存在了，是吗？

Surrender is inner acceptance of what is without any reservations. We are talking about your life this instant not the conditions or circumstances of your life, not what I call your life situation. We have spoken about this already.

臣服是内心毫无保留地接纳事实。此刻我们在谈论的是你的生命，而不是谈论你的生活条件或生活环境，也就是生命情境。

With regard to illness, this is what it means. Illness is part of your life situation. As such, it has a past and a future. Past and future form an uninterrupted continuum, unless the redeeming power of the Now is activated through your conscious presence. As you know, underneath the various conditions that make up your life situation, which exists in time, there is something deeper, more essential: your Life, your very Being in the timeless Now.

疾病是你生活情境中的一部分，因此它有过去和未来。过去和未来会构成一个连续体，只有通过你的意识，存在当下的力量才可能被激活。如你所知，构成你生活状况的各种条件存在于时间里，但是在这些生活状况之下却有着更深层、更重要的东西——你的生命，无时间的当下时刻。

As there are no problems in the Now, there is no illness either. The belief in a label that someone attaches to your condition keeps the condition in place, empowers it, and makes a seemingly solid reality out of a temporary imbalance. It gives it not only reality and solidity but also a continuity in time that it did not have before. By focusing on this instant and refraining from labeling it mentally, illness is reduced to one or several of these factors: physical pain, weakness, discomfort, or disability. That is what you surrender to now. You do not surrender to the idea of “illness.” Allow the suffering to force you into the present moment, into a state of intense conscious presence. Use it for enlightenment.

由于在当下时刻没有问题存在，也就没有疾病的存在了。借由聚焦在每一瞬间，而不去给它贴上心理标签，疾病就被简化为一个或几个因素：身体的疼痛、虚弱、不适或残疾。这就是你现在需要向其臣服的东西，而不是臣服疾病这个概念。允许痛苦迫使你进入当下时刻，进入强烈的意识临在状态，利用它来开悟。

Surrender does not transform what is, at least not directly. Surrender transforms you. When you are transformed, your whole world is transformed, because the world is only a reflection. We spoke about this earlier.

臣服不是改变现实，至少不是直接地改变。臣服改变的是你。当你被改变了，你的整个世界就改变了，因为世界只是你内在的反映。我们之前已经谈论过这一点。

If you looked in the mirror and did not like what you saw, you would have to be mad to attack the image in the mirror. That is precisely what you do when you are in a state of nonacceptance. And, of course, if you attack the image, it attacks you back. If you accept the image, no matter what it is, if you become friendly toward it, it cannot not become friendly toward you. This is how you change the world.

如果你照镜子时并不喜欢镜子中的你，而开始攻击镜子中的意象的话，这就是疯狂的！而这就是当你处于不接受状态时所做的。当然，如果你攻击了镜子中的意象，它会反过来攻击你。如果你接受了镜子中的意象，不管它是什么样子，如果你对它友善，它就不可能对你不友善。这就是你改变世界的方式。

Illness is not the problem. You are the problem as long as the egoic mind is in control. When you are ill or disabled, do not feel that you have failed in some way, do not feel guilty. Do not blame life for treating you unfairly, but do not blame yourself either. All that is resistance. If you have a major illness, use it for enlightenment. Anything “bad” that happens in your life use it for enlightenment. Withdraw time from the illness. Do not give it any past or future. Let it force you into intense present-moment awareness and see what happens. Become an alchemist. Transmute base metal into gold,suffering into consciousness, disaster into enlightenment. Are you seriously ill and feeling angry now about what I have just said? Then that is a clear sign that the illness has become part of your sense of self and that you are now protecting your identity as well as protecting the illness. The condition that is labeled “illness” has nothing to do with who you truly are.

疾病不是问题，你才是问题——只要你的小我思维处于控制状态。在你生病或残废时，不要认为你在某个方面已经失败了，不要感觉愧疚。不要责备生活对你不公平，更不要责备你自己。所有的这些都是抗拒。如果你生的是大病，请利用它去实现开悟。利用生活中任何“坏”的东西去开悟。把时间从疾病中撤除。不要为它贴上任何过去和现在的标签。让它迫使你进入强烈的当下时刻，并观察所发生的事情。

请成为一个炼金术士。将金属变成金子，把痛苦变成意识，把疾病变成开悟。

如果你生了重病，你会对我刚才所说的感到愤怒吗？如果是这样，就表明疾病已成为你自我意识的一部分，你正在保护你的思维认同，保护你的疾病。实际上，被标记成疾病的状况与你的真正本质无关。

## WHEN DISASTER STRIKES

As far as the still unconscious majority of the population is concerned, only a critical limit-situation has the potential to crack the hard shell of the ego and force them into surrender and so into the awakened state. A limit-situation arises when through some disaster, drastic upheaval, deep loss, or suffering your whole world is shattered and doesn't make sense anymore. It is an encounter with death, be it physical or psychological. The egoic mind, the creator of this world, collapses. Out of the ashes of the old world, a new world can then come into being.

对于绝大部分无意识的人来说，只有在某种极限情况（limit-situation）下才有潜力打破自我的坚硬外壳，迫使他们臣服并进入觉醒状态。极限情况包括灾难、暴动、巨大的损失或你的个人世界的毁灭等。这是一个与死亡的会晤，不管是肉体上或心理上的小我思维——这个物质世界的创造者——毁灭了。在旧世界的灰烬中，一个新的世界会诞生。

There is no guarantee, of course, that even a limit- situation will do it, but the potential is always there. Some people's resistance to what is even intensifies in such a situation, and so it becomes a descent into hell. In others, there may only be partial surrender, but even that will give them a certain depth and serenity that were not there before. Parts of the ego shell break off, and this allows small amounts of the radiance and peace that lie beyond the mind to shine through.

我们当然不能保证极限情况会有这种效果，但它的潜力是存在的。在这种情况下，有些人对事实的抗拒会更加强烈，以至于让他们入了地狱。还有些人，只能部分地臣服，但是这样也会给他们一定的深度和宁静。部分自我外壳打破了，这样就使得隐藏在思维背后少量的光辉和宁静穿越出来。

Limit-situations have produced many miracles. There have been murderers in death row waiting for execution who, in the last few hours of their lives, experienced the egoless state and the deep joy and peace that come with it. The inner resistance to the situation they found themselves in became so intense as to produce unbearable suffering, and there was nowhere to run and nothing to do to escape it, not even a mind-projected future. So they were forced into complete acceptance of the unacceptable. They were forced into surrender. In this way, they were able to enter the state of grace with which comes redemption: complete release from the past. Of course, it is not really the limit-situation that makes room for the miracle of grace and redemption but the act of surrender.

极限情况创造了许多奇迹。有些谋杀犯在等待死刑的最后几个小时，可能会体验到这种无自我的状态及其所带来的深沉的喜悦和宁静。他们曾经对事实如此强烈的抗拒，让他们感受到无法忍耐的痛苦，并且他们无处可逃，也无法可逃，甚至没有一个思维可以投身其中的未来。所以他们被迫接受了这种不可接受的事实。他们被迫臣服。这样他们就进入了恩典的状态，而被从过去之中解放出来。当然，使恩典的奇迹得以发生的不是所谓的极限情境，而是臣服的举动。

So whenever any kind of disaster strikes, or something goes seriously “wrong” illness, disability, loss of home or fortune or of a socially defined identity, break-up or a close relationship, death or suffering of a loved one, or your own impending death know that there is another side to it, that you are just one step away from something incredible: a complete alchemical transmutation of the base metal of pain and suffering into gold. That one step is called surrender.

所以，无论何时，即便是灾难降临时或者某些事情严重出错时——疾病，残废，丧失家园、财富或社会身份，爱人去世或遭受痛苦，失恋，或自己面临死亡——你都会知道它们还有另外一面：一个完全转化的炼金术，把痛苦的金属变成金子，并且你离它们只有一步之遥。这一步就叫臣服。

I do not mean to say that you will become happy in such a situation. You will not. But fear and pain will become transmuted into an inner peace and serenity that come from a very deep place from the Unmanifested itself. It is “the peace of God, which passes all understanding.” Compared to that, happiness is quite a shallow thing. With this radiant peace comes the realization not on the level of mind but within the depth of your Being that you are indestructible, immortal. This is not a belief. It is absolute certainty that needs no external evidence or proof from some secondary source.

我不是说在这种情况中你会变得开心。你不会的。但是恐惧和痛苦将会被转变成一种内心的宁静。这种宁静来自一个深沉的地方——未显化状态。这就是超越一切的平安。快乐与之相比只是非常浅薄的东西。在光明的平和里你会产生一份体悟——不是来自思维层面，而是来自你本体的深处——你体悟到了你的不灭和不朽。这不是一个信念，而是不需要他证的绝对确信。

## TRANSFORMING SUFFERING INTO PEACE

> I read about a stoic philosopher in ancient Greece who, when he was told that his son had died in an accident, replied, “I knew he was not immortal.” Is that surrender? If it is, I don't want it. There are some situations in which surrender seems unnatural and inhuman.
>
> 我读过有关古希腊一位禁欲哲学家的文章，当他被告知他的儿子死于意外时，他回答说：“我早知道他不是不朽的。”这是臣服吗？如果是，我不要这种臣服。在有些情况下，臣服看起来不自然而且没有人性。

Being cut off from your feelings is not surrender. But we don't know what his inner state was when he said those words. In certain extreme situations, it may still be impossible for you to accept the Now. But you always get a second chance at surrender.

切断你的感受并不是臣服。但是我们不知道当这位哲学家说这样的话时，他的内心状态是怎样的。在有些极端的情况下，你可能仍然不可能接受当下时刻，但是你仍然会得到第二次臣服的机会。

Your first chance is to surrender each moment to the reality of that moment. Knowing that what is cannot be undone because it already is you say yes to what is or accept what isn't. Then you do what you have to do, whatever the situation requires. If you abide in this state of acceptance, you create no more negativity, no more suffering, no more unhappiness. You then live in a state of nonresistance, a state of grace and lightness, free of struggle.

你的第一个机会是向当下的现实臣服。承认现实不能改变——因为它已经发生了。然后视情况而定，做你必须做的事情。如果你接受现实，就不会再有消极心态，不会再有痛苦，不会再有不开心的事。这样你就会生活在一种非抗拒的状态之中，一种充满恩典、轻松、没有挣扎的状态。

Whenever you are unable to do that, whenever you miss that chance either because you are not generating enough conscious presence to prevent some habitual and unconscious resistance pattern from arising, or because the condition is so extreme as to be absolutely unacceptable to you then you are creating some form of pain, some form of suffering. It may look as if the situation is creating the suffering, but ultimately this is not so your resistance is.

如果你做不到这样，当你错失了这第一个机会时——因为你没有足够的意识来阻止一些习惯性的和无意识的抗拒，或者因为情况是如此的极端，到了你绝对无法接受的程度——你就会创造某种形式的痛苦。表面上看起来是情况在创造痛苦，其实是你的抗拒在创造痛苦。

Now here is your second chance at surrender: If you cannot accept what is outside, then accept what is inside. If you cannot accept the external condition, accept the internal condition. This means: Do not resist the pain. Allow it to be there. Surrender to the grief, despair, fear, loneliness, or whatever form the suffering takes. Witness it without labeling it mentally. Embrace it. Then see how the miracle of surrender transmutes deep suffering into deep peace. This is your crucifixion. Let it become your resurrection and ascension.

现在你还有第二个臣服的机会：如果你不能接受外在的状况，那么请你接受内心状况。这就是说，不要去抗拒痛苦，允许它的存在。向悲伤、绝望、恐惧、孤单或者任何形式的痛苦臣服。在不贴心理标签的情况下去观察它，拥抱它。然后，观察臣服的奇迹是如何将深深的痛苦转化为深深的宁静的。这显然是你的磨难，但让它成为你复活和提升的契机。

>  I do not see how one can surrender to suffering. As you yourself pointed out, suffering is non-surrender. How could you surrender to non-surrender?
>
> 我不明白一个人如何向痛苦臣服。如像你自己所指出的那样，痛苦是不臣服，那么，你是怎样向不臣服去臣服的？

Forget about surrender for a moment. When your pain is deep, all talk of surrender will probably seem futile and meaningless anyway. When your pain is deep, you will likely have a strong urge to escape from it rather than surrender to it. You don't want to feel what you feel. What could be more normal? But there is no escape, no way out. There are many pseudo escapes work, drink, drugs, anger, projection, suppression, and so on but they don't free you from the pain. Suffering does not diminish in intensity when you make it unconscious. When you deny emotional pain, everything you do or think as well as your relationships become contaminated with it. You broadcast it, so to speak, as the energy you emanate, and others will pick it up subliminally. If they are unconscious, they may even feel compelled to attack or hurt you in some way, or you may hurt them in an unconscious projection of your pain. You attract and manifest whatever corresponds to your inner state. When there is no way out, there is still always a way through. So don't turn away from the pain. Face it. Feel it fully. Feel it don't think about it! Express it if necessary, but don't create a script in your mind around it. Give all your attention to the feeling, not to the person, event, or situation that seems to have caused it. Don't let the mind use the pain to create a victim identity for yourself out of it. Feeling sorry for yourself and telling others your story will keep you stuck in suffering. Since it is impossible to get away from the feeling, the only possibility of change is to move into it; otherwise, nothing will shift. So give your complete attention to what you feel, and refrain from mentally labeling it. As you go into the feeling, be intensely alert. At first, it may seem like a dark and terrifying place, and when the urge to turn away from it comes, observe it but don't act on it. Keep putting your attention on the pain, keep feeling the grief, the fear, the dread, the loneliness, whatever it is. Stay alert, stay present present with your whole Being, with every cell of your body. As you do so, you are bringing a light into this darkness. This is the flame of your consciousness.

请暂且忘记臣服。当你深深地陷入痛苦之中时，所有对臣服的谈论都可能无效和没有意义。当你的痛苦很深刻时，你可能有很强的欲望去逃避它而不是向它臣服。你不想去感受你所感受的，还有什么会比这更正常呢？但是这种逃避无济于事。你有许多种逃避方式——工作、喝酒、药物、愤怒、压抑等，但是它们不会使你从痛苦中解放出来。痛苦不会因为你把它压到无意识中而减轻。当你否认你情绪上的痛苦时，你所做的或所想的，以及你与别人的关系都会被它所污染。你会传播它们，就像你散发你的能量一样，其他人就会潜意识地拾起你的痛苦。如果他们处于无意识状态中的话，他们可能会不由自主地以某种形式攻击或伤害你。或者你会无意识地将你的痛苦投射到对方，从而伤害他们。你会吸引或创造和你内在状态呼应的事件。

当你无法脱离痛苦时，你仍然还有另外一个选择。那就是，不去逃避它，而是去面对它，去全面地感受它。感受它，但不要去思考它。如果有需要，你可以将你的痛苦表达出来，但是不要在你的思维中去写剧本。将注意力集中在你的感受上，而不是集中在造成这种感觉的人、事情或情况上。别让思维利用你的痛苦去创造一种受害者身份。为自己感到可怜并将自己的故事告诉他人会使你困在痛苦中。由于你不可能从这种感觉中脱离出来，所以转化痛苦的唯一可能性就是深入痛苦之中，否则任何事情都不会发生变化。所以请将你的注意力集中在你的感觉之上，并且不要对它做任何心理标记。当你深入这种感觉时，请保持高度警觉。首先，它可能看起来像一个黑暗而令人恐惧的地方，并且当你脱离它的愿望产生时，请观察它但不要采取行动。不断地将你的注意力集中在你的痛苦上，并感受悲伤、恐惧、愤恨和孤单等。请保持警觉，保持临在——与你的整个存在共存，与你身体的每一个细胞共存。当你这样做的时候，你就会将光明带进黑暗。这就是你意识的火焰。

At this stage, you don't need to be concerned with surrender anymore. It has happened already. How? Full attention is full acceptance, is surrender. By giving full attention, you use the power of the Now, which is the power of your presence. No hidden pocket of resistance can survive in it. Presence removes time. Without time, no suffering, no negativity, can survive.

在这个阶段，你不需要再关注臣服了。它已经发生了。如何发生的？全面的关注就是全面的接受，就是臣服。通过全面关注，你利用了当下的力量，也就是你本体的力量。没有任何抗拒可以在这种力量中生存。进入当下时刻，就不会有时间的存在，没有时间，就不会有痛苦，也不会有消极心态。

The acceptance of suffering is a journey into death. Facing deep pain, allowing it to be, taking your attention into it, is to enter death consciously. When you have died this death, you realize that there is no death and there is nothing to fear. Only the ego dies. Imagine a ray of sunlight that has forgotten it is an inseparable part of the sun and deludes itself into believing it has to fight for survival and create and cling to an identity other than the sun. Would the death of this delusion not be incredibly liberating?

对痛苦的接受是通向死亡的旅程。面对痛苦，允许它的存在，接受它的事实，将你的注意力集中在它身上，就是有意识地进入死亡。当你已经消灭了这个死亡，你就会认识到没有死亡——你也不会再有恐惧。唯一死亡的就是小我。

Do you want an easy death? Would you rather die without pain, without agony? Then die to the past every moment, and let the light of your presence shine away the heavy, time-bound self you thought of as “you.”

你想要有一种轻松的死亡方式吗？你想要没有痛苦地死去吗？那么请你随着每一刻的消逝而死亡，让你的意识之光驱散被时间包围的小我。

## THE WAY OF THE CROSS

> There are many accounts of people who say they have found God through their deep suffering, and there is the Christian expression “the way of the cross, ” which I suppose points to the same thing.
>
> 许多人说，通过深深的痛苦，他们找到了上帝，基督教中流传一句话“受苦之路”，我想这指的是一回事。

We are concerned with nothing else here. Strictly speaking, they did not find God through their suffering, because suffering implies resistance. They found God through surrender, through total acceptance of what is, into which they were forced by their intense suffering. They must have realized on some level that their pain was self-created. 

严格地说，他们没有通过痛苦找到上帝，因为痛苦意味着抗拒。他们通过臣服，通过完全接受事实找到了上帝，剧烈的痛苦迫使他们进入这种状态。他们在某个层面已经认识到，他们的痛苦是自己创造的。

> How do you equate surrender with finding God? 
>
> 你为什么将臣服和找到上帝看成是一回事？

Since resistance is inseparable from the mind, relinquishment of resistance surrender is the end of the mind as your master, the impostor pretending to be “you,” the false god. All judgment and all negativity dissolve. The realm of Being, which had been obscured by the mind, then opens up. Suddenly, a great stillness arises within you, an unfathomable sense of peace. And within that peace, there is great joy. And within that joy, there is love. And at the innermost core, there is the sacred, the immeasurable, That which cannot be named.

因为抗拒与思维密不可分，放弃抗拒，即臣服，就是思维的终结。放弃抗拒，所有的批判和消极心态都会消失。这样，以前被思维所遮挡的本体就会敞开大门。突然之间，在你的内心就会产生宁静的空间，其中就有巨大的喜悦。在这种喜悦中就有爱的存在，并且在内心的最深处，有一种神圣的、不可测量的和不可名状的东西。

I don't call it finding God, because how can you find that which was never lost, the very life that you are? The word God is limiting not only because of thousands of years of misperception and misuse, but also because it implies an entity other than you. God is Being itself, not a being. There can be no subject-object relationship here, no duality, no you and God. God-realization is the most natural thing there is. The amazing and incomprehensible fact is not that you can become conscious of God but that you are not conscious of God.

我不称它为找到上帝，因为你怎么能找到那永远不会丧失，且就是你的本质的生命？上帝这个词是有局限性的，不仅是因为几千年来的错误理解和错误运用，还因为它意味着一个在你之外的实体。上帝是本体本身，而不是一个实体。这里没有主观和客观的关系，没有二元性，没有你和上帝。上帝的实现是最为自然的事情。

The way of the cross that you mentioned is the old way to enlightenment, and until recently it was the only way. But don't dismiss it or underestimate its efficacy. It still works.

你提到的受苦之路是一种通向开悟的旧方式，一直以来，都是唯一的方式。但是请不要低估它的效用，它仍然很有效。

The way of the cross is a complete reversal. It means that the worst thing in your life, your cross, turns into the best thing that ever happened to you, by forcing you into surrender, into “death,” forcing you to become as nothing, to become as God because God, too, is no-thing.

受苦之路的意思是通过迫使你臣服，迫使你进入死亡状态，迫使你变得一无所有，迫使你变成上帝——因为上帝也是一无所有的——将这些你生活中最坏的事情、你的磨难变成在你身上发生过的最好的事情。

人类的痛苦不是上帝的惩戒，而是由人类自己造成的。

At this time, as far as the unconscious majority of humans is concerned, the way of the cross is still the only way. They will only awaken through further suffering, and enlightenment as a collective phenomenon will be predictably preceded by vast upheavals. This process reflects the workings of certain universal laws that govern the growth of consciousness and thus was foreseen by some seers. It is described, among other places, in the Book of Revelation or Apocalypse, though cloaked in obscure and sometimes impenetrable symbology. This suffering is inflicted not by God but by humans on themselves and on each other as well as by certain defensive measures that the Earth, which is a living, intelligent organism, is going to take to protect herself from the onslaught of human madness.

现在，对于绝大部分无意识的人来说，受苦仍然是开悟的唯一方式。他们只有通过遭受磨难才能觉醒，才能开悟。这个过程反映了主导意识增长的宇宙规律的作用，并且有些先知也预测到了这一点。人类的痛苦不是上帝的惩戒，而是由人类自己造成的，同时还有来自地球的防卫措施，因为地球是一个充满智慧的生物体，它会保护自己不受人类疯狂行为的伤害。

However, there is a growing number of humans alive today whose consciousness is sufficiently evolved not to need any more suffering before the realization of enlightenment. You may be one of them.

然而，今天有越来越多的人在开悟之前就有足够的意识来避免遭受任何痛苦。或许，你也可能是他们之中的一员。

Enlightenment through suffering the way of the cross means to be forced into the kingdom of heaven kicking and screaming. You finally surrender because you can't stand the pain anymore, but the pain could go on for a long time until this happens. Enlightenment consciously chosen means to relinquish your attachment to past and future and to make the Now the main focus of your life. It means choosing to dwell in the state of presence rather than in time. It means saying yes to what is. You then don't need pain anymore. How much more time do you think you will need before you are able to say “I will create no more pain, no more suffering?” How much more pain do you need before you can make that choice?

通过受苦来开悟，即受苦之路，你最终会被迫臣服，因为你不能再忍受任何痛苦了。开悟会有意识地选择让你放弃对过去和未来的执着，来使当下时刻成为你生活中的重点。它会使你进入临在状态而不是时间状态。它意味着你对事实说“是”，这样你就不会有任何痛苦。在你说“我不会再创造痛苦，不会再遭受痛苦”之前，还需要多长时间？你到底还要受多少苦才能让你做出那个选择？

If you think that you need more time, you will get more time and more pain. Time and pain are inseparable.

如果你认为你还需要更多的时间，你就会得到更多的时间，当然，还会遭受更多的痛苦。时间和痛苦是密不可分的。

## THE POWER TO CHOOSE

> What about all those people who, it seems, actually want to suffer? I have a friend whose partner is physically abusive toward her, and her previous relationship was of a similar kind. Why does she choose such men, and why is she refusing to get out of that situation now? Why do so many people actually choose pain?
>
> 那些的确想受苦的人又是怎样的呢？我有一个朋友经常遭受其伴侣的虐待，并且她之前的伴侣也是这样对她的。她为什么要选择这样的男人，为什么她不从这种情况中摆脱出来？为什么有这么多人要选择痛苦？

I know that the word choose is a favorite New Age term, but it isn't entirely accurate in this context. It is misleading to say that somebody “chose” a dysfunctional relationship or any other negative situation in his or her life. Choice implies consciousness a high degree of consciousness. Without it, you have no choice. Choice begins the moment you disidentify from the mind and its conditioned patterns, the moment you become present. Until you reach that point, you are unconscious, spiritually speaking. This means that you are compelled to think, feel, and act in certain ways according to the conditioning of your mind. That is why Jesus said: “Forgive them, for they know not what they do.” This is not related to intelligence in the conventional sense of the word. I have met many' highly intelligent and educated people who were also completely unconscious, which is to say completely identified with their mind. In fact, if mental development and increased knowledge are not counterbalanced by a corresponding growth in consciousness, the potential for unhappiness and disaster is very great. Your friend is stuck in a relationship with an abusive partner, and not for the first time. Why? No choice. The mind, conditioned as it is by the past, always seeks to recreate what it knows and is familiar with. Even if it is painful, at least it is familiar. The mind always adheres to the known. The unknown is dangerous because it has no control over it. Thats why the mind dislikes and ignores the present moment. Present-moment awareness creates a gap not only in the stream of mind but also in the past-future continuum. Nothing truly new and creative can come into this world except through that gap, that clear space of infinite possibility.

我知道“选择”这个词是新时代最喜欢用的词，但是在这种情况中它的意思就不完全准确了。认为某人在他或她的生活中“选择”一种不正常的关系或一种消极的生活状况，这种观点具有误导性。选择意味着意识——高程度的意识。没有它，你就不会有选择。当你从思维和条件反应模式中解放出来时，选择就开始了。在你达到这种阶段之前，你是无意识的。从灵性的角度来说，这意味着你被迫根据思维的制约模式去思考、去感觉、去采取行动。“宽恕他们吧，因为他们不知道他们所做的事。”这与智力没有关系。我遇到过许多高智商的和受过高等教育的人，他们完全没有意识，也就是说他们完全被他们的思维所控制。事实上，如果智力和知识的增长与相应的意识增长不协调，不幸和灾难的爆发潜力是巨大的。

由于受到过去思维的制约，大脑通常会努力再创造它所记得的和熟悉的东西。

你的朋友陷入一种受虐待的爱情关系之中，并且不是第一次了，为什么？因为没有选择。由于受到过去思维的制约，大脑通常会努力再创造它所记得的和熟悉的东西——即使那些让你痛苦，但是至少它们对你而言是熟悉的。大脑通常会附着于它记得的事情。不记得的事情是很危险的，因为大脑没法控制它。这就是大脑不喜欢和忽略当下时刻的原因。对当下时刻的觉知，在大脑和“过去——未来”的连续体中打开了一个裂口。除非通过这个裂口，否则没有任何新的、具有创造力的东西能进入这个世界。

So your friend, being identified with her mind, may be re-creating a pattern learned in the past in which intimacy and abuse are inseparably linked. Alternatively, she may be acting out a mind pattern learned in early childhood according to which she is unworthy and deserves to be punished. It is possible, too, that she lives a large part of her life through the pain-body, which always seeks more pain on which to feed. Her partner has his own unconscious patterns, which complement hers. Of course her situation is self- created, but who or what is the self that is doing the creating? A mental-emotional pattern from the past, no more. Why make a self out of it? If you tell her that she has chosen her condition or situation, you are reinforcing her state of mind identification. But is her mind pattern who she is? Is it her self? Is her true identity derived from the past? Show your friend how to be the observing presence behind her thoughts and her emotions. Tell her about the pain-body and how to free herself from it. Teach her the art of inner-body awareness. Demonstrate to her the meaning of presence. As soon as she is able to access the power of the Now, and thereby break through her conditioned past, she will have a choice.

所以，你的朋友被她的思维所控制，可能会重新创造一种从过去学来的模式。在这种模式中，亲密和虐待是密不可分的。另外，她可能根据孩童时期学来的模式采取行动，这个模式告诉她，她是没有价值并且应该受到惩罚的，也有可能是她大部分时间都通过痛苦之身在生活，而痛苦之身必须以痛苦为食。她的伴侣也有他自己的无意识的思维模式，这种模式正好和她的互补。当然，她的情况是自我创造的，但是创造这种情况的自我是谁呢？它就是来源于过去的心理——情绪模式。为什么它会创造一个自我呢？如果你告诉她，她已经选择了这种情况，你就是在加强她思维认同的力量。但是她的思维模式是她吗？是她的自我吗？她真正的身份是否来源于过去？请告诉你的朋友如何观察她思维和情绪背后的存在。告诉她有关痛苦之身和如何从中摆脱。教她内在身体觉察的艺术。向她示范临在的意义。只要她拥有当下的力量，她就会打破制约着她的过去，那她就会有一个选择。

Nobody chooses dysfunction, conflict, pain. Nobody chooses insanity. They happen because there is not enough presence in you to dissolve the past, not enough light to dispel the darkness. You are not fully here. You have not quite woken up yet. In the meantime, the conditioned mind is running your life.

没有人会选择失常、痛苦、冲突。没有人会选择疯狂。这种情况的发生是因为你没有足够的意识来消除过去，没有足够的光亮来驱散黑暗。你没有完全地保持临在，你还未完全觉醒。同时，受制约的思维仍然在控制着你的生活。

Similarly, if you are one of the many people who have an issue with their parents, if you still harbor resentment about something they did or did not do, then you still believe that they had a choice that they could have acted differently. It always looks as if people had a choice, but that is an illusion. As long as your mind with its conditioned patterns runs your life, as long as you are your mind, what choice do you have? None. You are not even there. The mind-identified state is severely dysfunctional. It is a form of insanity. Almost everyone is suffering from this illness in varying degrees. The moment you realize this, there can be no more resentment. How can you resent someone's illness? The only appropriate response is compassion.

与此相似的是，如果你和多数人一样，与你的父母之间存在问题，如果你仍然怨恨你父母所做的或没做的事，那么你就会相信他们当时有个选择，他们可以采取不同的行动。人们看起来好像是有选择的，但这其实是一个错觉。只要你的思维及其受制约的模式控制着你的生活，你还会有什么选择？没有。你甚至不在当下时刻。你思维认同的状态严重失常。这是一种病态的疯狂。几乎每一个人都遭受着这种疾病带来的痛苦，只是程度不一样罢了。当你认识到这一点时，你就不会有任何怨恨了。你怎么能去怨恨别人的疾病呢？唯一合适的反应就是慈悲。

只有拥有当下的力量，也就是你自己的力量，你才能真正地宽恕。

> So that means nobody is responsible for what they do? I don't like that idea.
>
> 所以，这就是说没有人应该为他们所做的事情负责？我不喜欢这个观点。

If you are run by your mind, although you have no choice you will still suffer the consequences of your unconsciousness, and you will create further suffering. You will bear the burden of fear, conflict, problems, and pain. The suffering thus created will eventually force you out of your unconscious state.

如果你被你的思维所控制，尽管你没有选择，你仍然会遭受着无意识带来的痛苦，并且你还会创造更多的痛苦。你将会忍受着恐惧、冲突、问题和痛苦带来的负担。这样，痛苦最终会迫使你脱离这种无意识的状态。

> What you say about choice also applies to forgiveness, I suppose. You need to be fully conscious and surrender before you can forgive.

“Forgiveness” is a term that has been in use for 2,000 years, but most people have a very limited view of what it means. You cannot truly forgive yourself or others as long as you derive your sense of self from the past. Only through accessing the power of the Now, which is your own power, can there be true forgiveness. This renders the past powerless, and you realize deeply that nothing you ever did or that was ever done to you could touch even in the slightest the radiant essence of who you are. The whole concept of forgiveness then becomes unnecessary.

两千年前人们就开始使用“宽恕”这个词，但是人们对它的理解却很有限。如果你的自我感觉源于过去，你就不会真正地宽恕自己和别人。只有拥有当下的力量，也就是你自己的力量，你才能真正地宽恕。这会使过去变得失去力量，并且你还会深刻地认识到你曾经做过的事，或别人对你做的事，连你的本质所散发出来的最微弱的光都无法伤及。这样宽恕的整个概念就变得没有必要了。

When you surrender to what is and so become fully present, the past ceases to have any power. You do not need it anymore. Presence is the key. The Now is the key.

当你向事实臣服时，你就会全面地进入当下时刻，并且过去将不再有任何力量。这样，你就不再需要任何过去了。临在是关键，当下时刻是关键。

When you no longer need to ask the question.

当你不再需要问问题的时候。
