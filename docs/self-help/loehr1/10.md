# Taking Action: The Power of Positive Rituals

Ivan Lendl was far from the most physically gifted tennis player of his era, but for five years he was the number-one-ranked player in the world. His edge was in the routines that he built. It is no surprise that Lendl practiced long hours on the court, or even that he did so at very precise times. What set him apart from other players on the tour was that he followed similar routines in every dimension of his life. He developed a rigorous fitness regimen off the court, which included sprints, middle-distance runs, long bicycle rides and strength training. He did regular ballet bar exercises to increase his balance and grace. He adhered to a low-fat, high complex-carbohydrate diet and ate at very specific times.

伊万·伦德尔并非这个时代最有天资的网球选手，但他曾5年位列世界头号种子选手。他的锋芒来自日常的磨练。他在球场上长时间训练，日程安排以分钟计算，这些都并不足以令人惊叹。让他从锦标赛选手里脱颖而出的，正是他几乎在生活各个方面都保持着相似的习惯。在球场外他也拥有一套精细的健身计划，包括短跑、中长跑、自行车长途拉练和力量训练。他还通过芭蕾杆上训练加强身体的平衡感和优雅度，坚持低脂、高复合碳水化合物的饮食，并且在精确的时间按时进餐。

Lendl also practiced a series of daily mental-focus exercises to improve his concentration—and regularly introduced new ones to assure that they remained challenging. At tournaments, he gave clear instructions to friends and family not to burden him with issues that might distract him from his mission. Whatever he did, he was either fully engaged or strategically disengaged. He even meticulously scheduled his time for relaxation and recovery, which included recreational golf, daily afternoon naps and regularly scheduled massages. On the court, during matches, he relied on another set of rituals to keep himself centered and focused, including visualizing entire points before playing them and following the same multiple-step ritual each time he stepped up to the line to serve. As longtime rival John McEnroe later said: “Much as I may have disliked him, I have to give Lendl credit. Nobody in the sport has ever worked as hard as he did. . . . Ivan wasn’t the most talented player, but his dedication—physical and mental, was incredible, second to none . . . and he did it all through rehearsal.”

伦德尔每天都要进行一系列思维专注练习，提高专注力，并不断加入新的内容，确保大脑始终面对挑战。在锦标赛时期，他会明确告知家人和朋友，不要用分散精力的事情给他增加负担。不管面对什么样的事情，他要么全情投入，要么有策略地离开。他甚至细致地规划了放松和恢复的时间，包括休闲高尔夫、午后小憩和定期按摩。比赛期间，他会依靠另一套习惯保持专注，在思维中做出预判，每次走到基线发球时都会遵循这套步骤。他长久以来的对手麦肯罗曾对他如此评价：“可能我并不喜欢伦德尔，但我还是要肯定他的努力。体育界没人像他一样刻苦……伊万或许不是最有天赋的选手，但他在身体和思维上的付出是杰出的，他比所有人都努力……他靠不断练习获得成功。”

Tiger Woods is the modern version of Lendl, albeit with considerably more talent, but with the same fierce dedication to rituals for managing energy in all dimensions of his life—physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. The payoff is clear. By his early twenties, Woods had become not only simply the best at what he does, but also the most consistently dominating golfer in the history of the game.

老虎伍兹则是现代版本的伦德尔，虽然他拥有更多的天赋。他同样在每个层面——体能、情感、思维和意志保持严格的精力管理习惯，相应的回报则显而易见。伍兹20多岁时不仅能够达到技能的巅峰，他还是高尔夫运动有史以来表现最稳定、最突出的选手。

It is perfectly logical to assume that Lendl excelled in part because he had extraordinary will and discipline. That probably isn’t so. A growing body of research suggests that as little as 5 percent of our behaviors are consciously self-directed. We are creatures of habit and as much as 95 percent of what we do occurs automatically or in reaction to a demand or an anxiety. What Lendl understood brilliantly and instinctively was the power of positive rituals—precise, consciously acquired behaviors that become automatic in our lives, fueled by a deep sense of purpose.

人们可以合理地推测，伦德尔的成功秘诀里应该包含超出常人的信念和自律。事实或许并非如此。有研究机构的实验表明，人类行为只有5%是受自我意识支配的。我们是习惯的造物，因而我们的行为有95%都是自动反应或对于某种需求或紧急情况的应激反应。伦德尔的成功，在于他正确认识到良好习惯的力量，将后天习得的精准行为融入日常，接受清晰的目标感的支配。

Positive energy rituals are powerful on three levels. They help us to insure that we effectively manage energy in the service of whatever mission we are on. They reduce the need to rely on our limited conscious will and discipline to take action. Finally, rituals are a powerful means by which to translate our values and priorities into action—to embody what matters most to us in our everyday behaviors.

积极的精力仪式习惯有三点重要性。首先它确保精力有效使用在当下的任务上，其次能够减少行为对主观意愿和自律的依赖，最后，它还能将价值观和目标感有效转化为行动，通过日常行为展现我们最为看重的事物。

## EXPEDIENT ADAPTATION

Like so many of us, Roger B. had become a prisoner of his negative energy habits and routines. Many of these choices were expedient—strategies for quickly marshaling energy without regard to the long-term energy consequences. Skipping breakfast made it possible for Roger to get to the office earlier but took no account of the effect that this choice had on his energy capacity throughout the morning. Drinking caffeinated coffee and diet colas was Roger’s way of artificially pumping up his energy in the face of inadequate sleep. Not exercising was a consequence of Roger’s inability to push himself physically when he felt so drained by other demands. It was difficult for Roger to imagine that once he built some endurance, **exercising might actually be a source of renewal—not just physically after long hours at his desk, but also mentally and emotionally**.

像许多人一样，罗杰也是不良习惯的囚徒。这些习惯多数都是应急措施，只能快速聚集精力而不考虑长期的后果。不吃早餐让罗杰可以早点进入办公室，却无法维持他整个上午的精力水平。咖啡和健怡可乐是罗杰用来对付睡眠不足的人工手段，不锻炼则是因为他在被其他事务拖累，无力抽身。罗杰很难想象得出，如果他能坚持下来，锻炼也会变成一种恢复手段，帮他补充长时间伏案工作消耗的体力、思维和情感。

Impatience and irritation were a means for Roger to vent his frustration—without regard for the toll that these negative emotions took on others and on his own energy reserves. Several drinks at night and the occasional cigarette were strategies Roger adopted to get immediate relief from stress—but they robbed him of energy in the short term and threatened his health in the long term. Keeping a certain distance from his wife and children was a means by which to avoid one more demand on his limited energy stores but at a cost to the emotional nourishment that comes from close relationships. Above all, Roger had adapted by disengaging—conserving energy by not investing too much of it in anything or allowing himself to think too deeply about the choices that he was making.

焦躁易怒是罗杰发泄沮丧的方式，他并没有考虑到这些负面情感对他人和自己精力储备的影响。夜间饮酒和偶尔抽烟能够立刻缓解压力，但它们也同样会在短期内消耗精力，为健康带来长期的危害。与妻子和孩子保持一定距离避免他继续消耗精力储备，却也让他失去了亲密关系的情感滋润。最后，罗杰选择了用心不在焉的方式对待生活——通过不投入任何事来保留精力，也不留给自己深入思考的余地。

Roger’s halfhearted attempts to change his behavior had been short-lived and ultimately unsuccessful. He was scarcely alone. Most of us are frustrated in our attempts to change, victims of the New Year’s resolution syndrome in which we make firm commitments to new behaviors, only to quickly fall back into our familiar patterns. Rituals serve as anchors, insuring that even in the most difficult circumstances we will continue to use our energy in service of the values that we hold most dear. We are all exposed to storms throughout our lives—sickness and disease; the death of loved ones; betrayal and disappointments; financial setbacks and layoffs from jobs. These are the situations in which our character is truly tested and our choices about how to manage energy are critical.

罗杰曾经半心半意地试图改变行为，最后都以失败告终。他并非个例，大多数人都曾在尝试改变的过程中碰一鼻子灰。比如，人们常常在新年夜许下改变自我的坚定承诺，结果没过多久就掉入旧日的行为模式。习惯好比船锚，它确保我们即使在最艰苦的环境里也会依循价值观支配精力。每个人都会经历生活的风暴——疾病苦痛，失去至爱，遭遇背叛和失望，生活困窘，失业等。这些情况正是考验品格的时机，此时精力使用的选择就变得尤为重要。

**The bigger the storm, the more inclined we are to revert to our survival habits, and the more important positive rituals become.**

面对的困难越大，人们越容易退回旧日的生存习惯，因此良好的习惯非常重要。

Great performers, whether they are athletes or fighter pilots, surgeons or Special Forces soldiers, FBI agents or CEOs, all rely on positive rituals to manage their energy and achieve their goals. The same is true, we have discovered, of anyone whose life is grounded in clearly defined values. “**Every time we participate in a ritual, we are expressing our beliefs, either verbally or more implicitly**,” write Evan Imber-Black and Janine Roberts, authors of Rituals for Our Times. “Families who sit down to dinner together every night are saying without words that they believe in the need for families to have shared time together. . . . Nightly bedtime rituals offer parents and children an opportunity to tell each other what they believe about all kinds of matters. The sheer act of doing the bedtime ritual expresses a belief in a certain kind of parent–child relationship where warmth and affection and safety are available.”

优秀的人才，不论是运动员还是战斗机飞行员，外科医生还是特勤战士，联邦调查局探员还是公司的CEO，人们都需要依靠积极的仪式习惯来管理精力，达到最终目标。我们发现，对有清晰明确的价值观的人而言，积极的习惯也同样重要。“每次我们参加一项仪式习惯，都是在表达自身信仰，无论是否以语言的形式呈现。”埃文·英伯-布莱克和简宁·罗伯茨在《我们时代的仪式习惯》一书中写道。“每晚坐下来一起享受晚餐的家庭，在无声而明确地传达着他们相信家人共度时间的重要性……夜晚的床头读书时间让父母和孩子有机会分享彼此事情的看法，这种纯粹的行为表示相信亲子关系可以带来温暖、爱护和安全。”

It is easy to dismiss as rigid and even extreme the highly structured routines of an athlete like Ivan Lendl. But stop for a moment and think about the people you admire—or simply look at the areas of your life in which you are most effective and productive. If you are like most of our clients, you already have many rituals in place—often outside your conscious awareness. These may range from habits of hygiene, to planning for the day ahead, to routines with your family. **Far from precluding spontaneity, rituals provide a level of comfort, continuity and security that frees us to improvise and to take risks**. Think of a great athlete producing a seemingly impossible shot under fierce pressure; a highly trained surgeon making a critical counterintuitive decision at a life-or-death moment during a delicate operation; or an executive breaking an impasse in a difficult, formal negotiation by suddenly coming up with a novel structure for a deal. **Rituals provide a stable framework in which creative breakthroughs often occur**. They can also open up time for recovery and renewal, when relationships can be deepened and spiritual reflection becomes possible.

伊万·伦德尔那样高度规划的日常习惯很容易被他人看作死板极端并置之不理。我们建议你思考一个或一群你钦佩的人物，或者审视自己在生活中最高效的领域。如果跟我们大部分客户一样，你很可能已经在不自知的情况下养成某些行为习惯了。可能是个人卫生习惯，规划全天的习惯，或者陪伴家人的习惯。习惯并不会妨碍自主性，而是提供一个舒适安全的氛围让我们自由地发挥、勇敢地冒险。想象一位伟大的运动员顶住强大的压力，在看似不可能的情况下得分取胜；一位受过良好训练的医师正在进行一场精密的手术，在生死关头却做出看似违反常理的决策；或者一位经理提出一种新颖的交易形式，打破了艰难的谈判僵局。习惯能够创造出一个稳定的框架，而突破性的创意往往孕育其中。习惯还可以留出精力恢复和再生的时间，加深人际关系，实现精神反思。

The limitations of conscious will and discipline are rooted in the fact that every demand on our self-control—from deciding what we eat to managing frustration, from building an exercise regimen to persisting at a difficult task—all draw on the same small easily depleted reservoir of energy.

主观意愿和自律性的局限在于，每一项对我们自制力的需求——不论是决定午餐内容还是控制挫败感，制订健身计划还是坚持一项困难的任务——都会消耗我们容易枯竭的精力储备。

In a series of imaginative experiments, several researchers have demonstrated how this plays out in everyday life. In one study, for example, subjects were deprived of food for several hours and then exposed to a plate of chocolate-chip cookies and other sweets. One group was given permission to indulge themselves. A second group was asked to refrain from eating sweets and to settle for radishes instead. The latter group succeeded in resisting the sweets, but then demonstrated significantly less persistence than the first group in a follow-up test trying to solve insoluble puzzles. In a second experiment, dieters who were presented with tempting food were able to control themselves but became significantly more likely to break the diet when faced with subsequent temptations. In still a third experiment, one group of subjects was asked to hold their hands under ice water for a specified period of time. They performed significantly worse on a series of subsequent proofreading tasks than a group that had not been subjected to the ice-water challenge.

一系列的创新实验展示了自制力在日常生活中的作用。其中一项实验中，研究者要求受试者在数小时内不准进食，任务完成后在他们面前摆上巧克力饼干和糖果。第一组人得到许可随心所欲，第二组被要求放弃点心，只能吃小萝卜。第二组人成功地拒绝了甜食的诱惑，在接下来的高难度拼图游戏中，第二组人却比第一组表现得更缺乏耐心。第二项实验里，节食者面对诱人的食物表现出自控，却更容易在接下来的诱惑中挑战失败。第三项实验里，一组受试者被要求把手放在冰水里一段时间，但是接下来的校稿任务中他们的表现明显低于未接受冰水挑战的受试者。

**The sustaining power of rituals comes from the fact that they conserve energy**. “We should not cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing,” wrote philosopher A. N. Whitehead, back in 1911. “The precise opposite is the case. **Civilization advances by extending the number of operations which we can perform without thinking about them**.” In contrast to will and discipline, which imply pushing ourselves to action, a well-defined ritual pulls us. We feel somehow worse if we don’t do it. Think about brushing your teeth or taking a shower or kissing your spouse goodbye in the morning or attending your child’s soccer games or calling your parents on a weekend. If we want to build into our lives new behaviors that last, we can’t spend much energy to sustain them.

仪式习惯的持久力来源于精力节约的本质。“我们不该培养先思后行的习惯，”哲学家怀特海于1911年写道。“反过来才是正确的。当人们不靠思索便能做出的行为越来越多，文明才得以进化。”意愿和自律推着我们行动，而悉心养成的仪式习惯会吸引我们做出行动，一旦做不到还会产生不适感，例如刷牙，沐浴，早晨吻别爱人，观看孩子的足球比赛，或者周末给父母打电话。如果我们需要一个能够持久的新行为，肯定不能花太多精力来维持它。

Since will and discipline are far more limited and precious resources than most of us realize, they must be called upon very selectively. Because even small acts of self-control use up this limited reservoir, consciously using this energy for one activity means it will be less available for the next one. The sobering truth is that we have the capacity for very few conscious acts of self-control in a day.

主动性和自律比我们想象的更加稀缺，因此我们必须选择性地取用。即使很小的自控行为都会耗尽储备，这次主动运用精力意味着下次可用的精力减少。清晰的事实是，我们每天只有非常有限的精力来进行自控。

Much as it is possible to strengthen a bicep or a tricep by subjecting it to stress and then recovering, so it is possible to strategically build the muscle of self-control. The same training regimen applies. Exercise self-control or empathy or patience past normal limits, and then allow time for rest and these muscles become progressively stronger. More reliably, however, we can offset the limitations of conscious will and discipline by building positive rituals that become automatic—and relatively effortless—as quickly as possible.

我们可以通过加大二头肌或三头肌的使用来增强力量，同样也可以有策略地锻炼自控能力。锻炼我们的自控、共情和耐心，超出平常的限度，然后留出时间，容它休息和恢复，这些“肌肉”就会逐渐强壮起来。不过，更高效的方法是尽快建立积极的仪式习惯，抵消主动意愿和自律的局限——因为习惯是自发产生的，不需要消耗意志的精力。

## THE RITUALS OF STRESS AND RECOVERY

**The most important role of rituals is to insure an effective balance between energy expenditure and energy renewal in the service of full engagement**. All great performers have rituals that optimize their ability to move rhythmically between stress and recovery. Jim’s discovery of the between-point recovery rituals, used by nearly all top tennis players, is an especially vivid example. In just sixteen to twenty seconds, these highly precise rituals prompt a remarkably efficient form of recovery.

仪式习惯最重要的作用是确保精力消耗与更新达到有效平衡，更好地为全情投入服务。所有表现出色的人都拥有一套自己的习惯，最大化在压力与恢复之间有节奏地转换的能力。吉姆的得分间休整习惯几乎被所有的顶级网球运动员采用，有力地证明了它的重要性。仅仅需要16～20秒，这些高度精确的习惯就变成了高效的恢复方式。

**The same stress-recovery balance is critical in any venue that demands performance**. **The more precise and effective our recovery rituals, the more quickly we can restore our energy reserves**. We have done a great deal of work with Wall Street traders, for example, who must sit in front of their computer terminals for long hours each day, and have very limited time for breaks. When we first suggested that they needed to build more recovery rituals into their days, they laughed at us.

在任何表现至上的领域，压力与恢复的平衡都至关重要。我们越能高效恢复精力，越能尽快储备资源以备调用。我们同许多华尔街的交易员合作过，他们每天都要在电脑终端前坐很久，几乎没有休息时间。当我们第一次建议他们养成恢复的习惯时，他们毫不掩饰地哈哈大笑起来。

“We barely have time to go to the bathroom,” they told us. “How are we going to take time for recovery?” We reminded them how quickly and efficiently athletes are able to recover and pointed out that even structured sixty-to ninety-second breaks throughout the day could provide a great deal of renewal. With our encouragement, they began devising their own rituals. These ranged from sixty seconds of deep breathing to putting on a Walkman and listening to a favorite song; from making a quick call home to check in and connect with a spouse or a child to walking up and down four flights of stairs; from playing a video game on the computer screen to eating an energy bar. **The more scheduled and systematic these rituals became, the more renewal they provided.**

“我们连去厕所都没有时间，”他们说，“哪里来的时间恢复？”我们向他们解释了运动员是如何高效地恢复精力的，指出60～90秒的间歇休息也同样有效。在我们的鼓励下，他们开始寻找适合自己的休息模式：60秒深呼吸锻炼，戴上耳机听一首最爱的歌曲，打电话问候伴侣和孩子，走下4层楼再爬上来，在电脑上打一盘游戏，吃一条能量棒，休息的方法越有计划和条理性，越能提供更多的精力。

Peter D. is a writer who sought our advice at a time when he was facing a highly challenging book deadline that he wasn’t sure he could meet. For years, Peter was used to putting in long continuous hours at his word processor. The problem, he told us, was that he found it hard to maintain his concentration, particularly as the day wore on. Our goal was to help him to shift from the mentality of a marathoner to that of a sprinter. We worked with Peter to develop rituals that alternated periods of intense engagement with relatively short but highly structured periods of recovery.

彼得在最迷茫的时候找到我们。他是一位作家，正在创作一本高难度的著作，但他没有信心能赶上截稿期。彼得一直以来习惯于长时间坐在电脑前的工作方式，但他也承认很难保持注意力，尤其是在下午。我们要帮助他完成从马拉松选手到短跑选手的思想转变，为此，我们一起讨论了几种有条理的休整方式，穿插在他高度紧张的工作中。

Because Peter told us that he felt freshest early in the morning, we had him begin his workdays at 6:30 A.M. and write for ninety minutes before he did anything else. To minimize distraction, he agreed to turn off his phone and not to check his email during his writing hours. At 8:00 A.M., Peter stopped to have breakfast with his wife and three children. We also suggested that he shift from his previous routine of eating a bagel or a muffin and a glass of orange juice, to the more sustaining energy of a protein drink. Peter returned to work at 8:30 A.M. and wrote without interruption until 10:00. At that point, he took a twenty-minute recovery break—ten minutes of training with light weights followed by ten minutes of meditation. He also ate a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts before heading back to his desk.

因为彼得说每天早晨是他精力最充沛的时段，我们建议他从6点半开始工作，持续90分钟，其间不涉及其他的事情。为了减少精力的分散，他同意在写作期间关掉手机，也不查收电子邮件。早上8点，彼得停止写作，与妻子和三个孩子一起吃早餐。我们也建议他改掉一杯橙汁加一个百吉饼或一个松饼的早餐传统，换成一杯能持续供应精力的蛋白质饮料。早餐结束后，彼得在8点半左右回到工作上，在不被打扰的情况下工作到10点。这时他要给自己安排20分钟休整， 10分钟轻举重锻炼， 10分钟用来冥想，并在回到办公桌之前吃一块水果或一把坚果。

Peter’s third writing session went from 10:30 until 12:00 NOON, at which point he went jogging and then ate lunch. During those 41/2 hours of focused morning work, Peter was able to write nearly twice as much as had sitting at his desk for up to ten hours a day in previous years. In the afternoons, he turned his attention to reading and research for the book, and to other business. In the evenings, feeling good about his productivity but also reasonably rested, Peter still had the energy to focus on his family.

第三段工作时间从10点半到12点，结束后他会先外出慢跑，然后回来吃午餐。经过这4.5小时的集中工作，他的产出是往日10个小时的两倍。下午他会读书、研究资料，或者处理其他事情。因为对一天的成果非常满意，晚上他也能够更加全心全意地陪伴家人。

**The more exacting the challenge, the more rigorous our rituals need to be.** The preparation of soldiers for combat is a good example. The rituals of basic training are so exacting—especially in the Marines—that soft, fearful and slovenly teenagers can be transformed into lean, confident, mission-driven soldiers in just eight to twelve weeks. Recruits are compelled to build rituals in every dimension of their lives—how they walk and how they talk; what time they go to bed and wake up; when and what they eat; how they take care of their bodies and how they think and act under pressure. This code of conduct makes it possible for them to do the right thing at the right time even in the face of the most severe of all stresses—the threat of death.

面对难度越大的挑战，仪式习惯越要细致入微。拿士兵备战举例，基础训练的安排非常细致——尤其是海军，只需8～10周就能把一个柔弱、胆怯、邋遢的少年变成结实、自信、充满使命感的士兵。新兵会被强制要求在各个方面养成习惯——走路和说话的方式，作息时间，进食时间和内容，照料身体的方式，压力下的思考和行为方式。正是这些行为习惯让他们能够在正确的时机做出正确的行为，即使面对死亡也全然不惧。

## CONTINUITY AND CHANGE

**Rituals also help us to create structure in our lives**. More than ever, we are bombarded by competing options and choices, endless information and infinite demands. As one top executive at a leading financial firm told us: “The biggest problem in American business today is the feeling that nothing is ever finished. There is no satisfaction to be derived from a job well done because there is always another demand to be met. We’re all running on an endless treadmill.” **Rituals create boundaries—clearly delineated opportunities to renew and refuel but also to take stock and to prepare for the next challenge**.

习惯能够把生活变得有条理。如今，我们被多重选择、无限的信息和无止境的需求前所未有地包围着。一家行业中领先的金融公司的高层管理者告诉我们：“当今美国商业面对的最大难题就是无止境的欲望。任务成功不会带来满足感，因为下一项甚至下下一项任务已经摆在你的眼前，好似踏上了一台永不停歇的跑步机。”清晰的仪式习惯能够划出界限，让你有机会更新和充实自己，为接下来的挑战做好准备。

Each time Ivan Lendl stepped up to the line to serve during a tennis match, he predictably wiped his brow with his wristband, knocked the head of his racquet against each of his heels, took sawdust from his pocket, bounced the ball four times and visualized where he intended to hit the ball. In the process, Lendl was recalibrating his energy: pushing away distraction, calming his physiology, focusing his attention, triggering reengagement and preparing his body to perform at its best. In effect, he was programming his internal computer. When the point began, the program ran automatically. Successful executives, managers and salespeople often have their own pre-performance rituals. In advance of an important meeting, these rituals might range from taking a walk in order to shift gears to abdominal breathing in order to relax; from rehearsing the key points to be covered to reciting a series of affirmations around desired outcomes.

伊万·伦德尔每次准备发球时，都会用护腕擦一下眉毛，用球拍磕磕两个鞋跟，从口袋中拿出锯末，弹球4次，想象着击球部位。在这个过程中，伦德尔正在重新校准精力——排除干扰事物，让身体平静下来，聚焦注意力，重新投入状态，全身准备发出漂亮一击。实际上，他的身体内部运行着一台精准的计算机，到了确定的时间就自行启动相应的程序。成功的管理者、经理和销售员都有自己的“战前准备程序”，可以是通过散步调整状态，用腹式呼吸放松身体，或预演讲话要点，或围绕预期目标排练话术。

In addition to creating continuity, rituals help to facilitate change. For thousands of years rituals have been used to take account of our accomplishments, give thanks for our blessings and facilitate the transition from one stage to another in our lives. We mark rites of passage with the bar mitzvah in Judiasm, the confirmation in Christianity and with celebrations around birthdays, anniversaries and graduations. Holiday rituals such as Thanksgiving and Christmas provide opportunities to give thanks, to take stock and to reconnect with loved ones. Weddings mark the movement from single to married life—simultaneously celebrating the promise of the future while acknowledging the momentousness of the transition. **More broadly, rituals imbue certain key events in our lives with meaning**.

除了建立延续性，仪式习惯还有助于改变。几千年来，我们都通过各种仪式分享成果、感谢生活的恩赐、开启人生的新篇章。犹太教的成人礼，天主教的受洗，还有生日、周年和毕业的庆祝活动等用来记录成熟的阶段。感恩节和圣诞节的传统让人们表达感恩，与所爱之人团聚。婚礼标志着单身生活的结束和婚姻生活的开始——在宣告新阶段开始的同时对未来许下承诺。广义而言，仪式为我们人生中的重大时刻赋予了不同的特别意义。

Unfortunately, many of us have negative associations with rituals. In part, this may be because rather than freely being chosen, they were imposed upon us early in our lives. **When a ritual begins to feel empty, stale and even oppressive, the likely explanation is that it has lost its connection to deeply held values**. To keep rituals alive and vibrant requires a delicate balance. Without the structure and clarity they provide, we are forever vulnerable to the urgent demands in our lives, the seductions of the moment and the limits of our conscious will and discipline. On the other hand, if our rituals become too rigid, unvarying and linear, the eventual consequence is boredom, disengagement and even diminished passion and productivity.

不幸的是，许多人对于仪式习惯都抱有不良的印象，可能是因为幼年被迫参加过某种仪式。当仪式习惯或习惯变得空洞、陈腐甚至沉重，很有可能是因为失去了同深层价值观的联系。为了保持仪式习惯的生命力和活力，我们需要达到一种精巧设定的平衡。如果失去了仪式习惯的条理和清晰性，我们将永远暴露在生活的压力之下，陷于得过且过的模式，被有限的个人意愿和自律性束缚手脚；如果放任仪式习惯变得生硬乃至僵化，最终它们会变得枯燥无趣，甚至消磨我们的热情和产出能力。

**Our dual challenge is to hold fast to our rituals when the pressures in our lives threaten to throw us off track, and to periodically revisit and change them so that they remain fresh**. It is critical, for example, to create structured workouts as part of any weight-training regime. However, if you continue to challenge the same body parts in the same way, you will eventually stop gaining strength, become bored and frustrated, and likely quit. Healthy rituals straddle the territory between the comfort of the past and the challenge of the future. Used to best advantage, rituals provide a source of security and consistency without thwarting change or undermining flexibility.

我们面临的挑战是双重的，一方面要坚持仪式习惯，面对生活将我们抛出轨道的威胁；另一方面要定期更新仪式习惯内容，确保它的活力。例如，任何举重训练都需要规划好运动方式，然而，如果持续以同样的方式锻炼同一处身体部位，力量最终会停止增长，人们也会失去兴趣，心灰意冷，很有可能就此放弃。健康的仪式习惯能够跨越过去的舒适感和未来挑战之间。当我们最佳利用仪式习惯时，它会带来安全感和持续性，而不会妨碍改变和潜在的灵活性。

## KEY BEHAVIORS

There are several key elements in building effective energy-management rituals but none so important as specificity of timing and the precision of behavior during the thirty-to sixty-day acquisition period. 

成功建立有效的精力管理仪式习惯需要依靠多种因素，但最核心的，仍然是30天或60天的养成周期中对于时间和行为的准确规划。

Ted D. and his wife, Donna, went through our program together. Like many of our clients, they complained that because their lives were so busy, they had too little time for one another. As it happened, they also worked together, running a mail-order catalog business. Most of their conversations, on and off the job, focused either on business or on dealing with the demands of their three teenage children.

泰德和妻子多娜一起参加了我们的培训。就像许多人一样，他们抱怨繁忙的工作剥夺了陪伴彼此的时间。那时他们经营着一家目录邮购公司，两人的对话要么有关工作，要么关于家里3个青春期孩子的琐事。

Ted and Donna decided to build a ritual around setting aside an hour and a half of uninterrupted time for one another on Saturday mornings. The first time that the designated day arrived, both of them had a couple of other pressing items to take care of first. By the time they were ready to talk, an hour had passed. Just as they were about to start, one of their kids awakened and wanted a ride to an athletic event. Before they knew it, the pressing nature of the day overcame their commitment to spend time together.

泰德和多娜决定建立一个仪式习惯，每周六上午安排1个半小时留给另一半，决不让外界事物干扰二人世界。第一个星期六如约而至，两人都有紧急的事务要处理。当他们准备坐下来交流时，已经过去了1个小时。一个孩子已经醒了，需要父母送他参加体育比赛。不知不觉，紧迫的一天压过了他们陪伴彼此的承诺。

When much the same thing happened the second week, Ted suggested that they set a specific start time—8:00 A.M.—and make it sacrosanct. They agreed not to answer the phone during their time together, and they asked their kids not to interrupt them. It worked immediately. Within a few weeks, however, a second issue emerged. Because Ted was more aggressive in talking about what was on his mind, he tended to take up the majority of their time together. To solve the problem, they agreed that Donna should go first, and that for the first forty-five minutes they would talk about whatever was on her mind. Then they switched roles and Ted took his turn. When we last spoke to them, it had been more than two years since they launched the ritual, and they had missed it perhaps half a dozen times. It had become deeply woven into the fabric of their lives, and both of them agreed that it had been a central factor in helping them to feel closely connected no matter how busy the rest of their lives become.

第二周的情况基本类似，因此泰德建议，把仪式习惯开始的具体时间确定下来——早上8点钟，任何情况都不能违反。夫妻俩承诺，这段时间里不接电话，也提前告知孩子们不要来打扰。在一家人的共同努力下，仪式习惯终于得以成功进行。几周后，第二个问题出现了。因为泰德过于强势地倾诉自己的感受，大部分时间都是他在讲话。为了解决这个问题，他们商量过后，决定从多娜开始，前45分钟交给她掌控，后45分钟才轮到泰德。我们向他们询问后续情况时，这项仪式习惯已经建立2年有余。虽然中间有几次没能按时执行，但它已经成为生活非常重要的一部分。夫妻俩都认为这个仪式习惯帮他们重新建立了亲密感，不论生活变得多么忙碌，他们都会抽出时间陪伴彼此。

Doug L. is an executive who spent nearly a decade overseeing several thousand financial advisers at a large financial services company. From early on, he instinctively understood the role of rituals. To assure that he embodied the values he had defined as important and the goals he had set for himself, he developed a series of what he called “key behaviors.” In his personal life these included a weekly date night with his wife and a commitment to attend all of his daughters’ athletic events. One of the more unusual rituals, for an executive at his level, was that on Wednesdays at 1:00 P.M., he left his office to play tennis for an hour, and on Fridays at 1:00 P.M. he played basketball for ninety minutes at a nearby YMCA. His secretary put these two dates in his weekly calendar and protected them the way she would any other high-priority appointment. For Doug, these two activities were critical sources of renewal in the course of his very demanding days. If he had been more casual about trying to find the time to exercise in the middle of workdays, he told us, it never would have happened. The same was true of the date night with his wife and the time he committed to his daughters.

道格是一家大型金融服务公司的高管，主管数千名金融顾问。他很早就意识到仪式习惯的重要性。为了维护自己的重要价值观和目标，他制订了一系列“重要举措”，包括每周与妻子约会，承诺女儿的比赛每场必到。对于他这种级别的高管来说，还有一项举措不同寻常：每周三下午1点钟外出打1个小时的网球，还有每周五下午1点钟在青年教会打1个半小时的篮球。秘书将这两次运动记入他的周日程，当作重要安排处理。对于道格来说，这两次运动是重要的精力更新的方式。如果他在工作日以随性的态度找时间锻炼身体，八成会以泡汤告终，与妻子和女儿的约定也是如此。

## PRECISION AND SPECIFICITY

A broad and persuasive array of studies confirms that **specificity of timing and precision of behavior dramatically increase the likelihood of success**. The explanation lies once again in the fact that our conscious capacity for self-control is limited and easily depleted. By determining when, where and how a behavior will occur, we no longer have to think much about getting it done. A series of experiments have confirmed this pattern. In one study, for example, participants were asked to write a report on how they intended to spend Christmas Eve, and to submit it within forty-eight hours. Half of the participants were told to specify exactly when and where they intended to write the report. The other half got no such deadline. Among those who had the precise deadline, 75 percent handed the reports in on time. Only one-third of the second group did so.

众多论据充足的研究都能证明，将时间和行为精准化和具体化，会在很大程度上增加成功的可能性。为了解释个中缘由，我们需要再次提到有限且易逝的自控能力储备。如果确定了时间、地点和具体行为，我们就不必在完成上想得太多。这个模式得到许多实验结果的证实。某项研究要求参与者写一篇圣诞前夜的规划报告并在48小时内提交。其中一半参与者被要求明确他们准备写作的时间和地点，另一半参与者则不作要求。结果第一组有75%的人都按时交上了报告，第二组只有三分之一做到了按时提交。

In another study, women were asked to perform a breast self-examination during the subsequent month. One group was asked to write down when and where they would do so, while the other was not. Both groups were then narrowed down to those women who had expressed a strong intention to complete the task. Nearly 100 percent of those who designated when and where they would do the exam completed it. Only 53 percent of the second group did so, despite equally strong intentions to conduct the exam.

另一项研究要求女性受试者在一个月时间内定期自查乳腺情况。两组受试者都对该活动表示出浓厚兴趣和坚定决心。一组人需要提交她们为自查安排的时间和地点，对另一组人则没作此项要求。第一组人几乎100%地完成了这项任务，第二组只有53%的人完成了任务，而实验开始前两组人在对于任务的决心并无差别。

In still a third study, the goal was to increase compliance in an fitness program that was being offered to a group of nonexercising college students. In a first attempt to motivate them, the subjects were given data about how exercise would significantly reduce their vulnerability to coronary heart disease. Participation in the program increased from 29 to 39 percent. When this information was followed by a request that students designate when and where they intended to exercise, compliance went to a remarkable 91 percent. Similar results were achieved in trying to help people adopt better eating habits. Participants proved far more likely to eat healthy, low calorie foods when they were asked in advance to specify precisely what they intended to eat for each of their meals during the day, rather than using their energy to resist eating certain foods all day long.

第三个研究的目标是提高大学生对健身计划的参与度。为了达到激励效果，先给他们看了一组健身能显著降低冠心病发病率的数据，学生参与度从29%上升至39%。接下来，研究员要求学生们写下自己详细的锻炼计划，参与度奇迹般上升到91%。同样的结果也出现在帮助人们改善饮食习惯的实验里。如果人们提前规划每顿饭的具体内容，则更可能摄入健康、低热量的食物。

In perhaps the most dramatic experiment of all, a group of drug addicts were studied during withdrawal—a time when the energy required to control the urge to take drugs severely compromises their ability to undertake nearly any other task. As part of the effort to help them find employment post-rehabilitation, one group was asked to commit to writing a short résumé before 5:00 P.M. on a particular day. Not a single one succeeded. A second group was asked to complete the same task, but also to say exactly when and where they would write the résumé. Eighty percent of that group succeeded.

或许最令人吃惊的情况是一群处于脱瘾期的吸毒者的实验。在脱瘾期里，吸毒者需要调用全部的精力抵抗毒品的诱惑，使得额外的事件变成不可能的任务。在帮助戒瘾者重返社会的项目里，研究者要求一组人下午5点之前上交一份个人简历，没有一个人能做到。第二组人被分配了同样的任务，唯一的不同之处在于他们需要写明自己何时何地开始制作简历，结果80%的人都完成了任务。

**The specificity and precision of rituals also makes it more likely that we will be able to produce them under pressure**. Bill Walsh, the brilliant former coach of the San Francisco 49ers, put it simply in describing his approach to football: “At all times the focus must be on doing things properly. Every play. Every practice. Every meeting. Every situation. Every time.” Walsh’s point applies to any performance venue. Practice makes perfect only if the practice is perfect—or at least aims for perfection. If you cannot perform a particular task effectively when you are feeling relaxed and unpressured, it is unlikely that you will be able to do so when the pressure is high, or when you are in the midst of a crisis. Building precise rituals makes it possible to push away the distractions and fears that arise under pressure. “**The less thinking people have to do under adverse circumstances, the better**,” explains Walsh. “**When you’re under pressure, the mind can play tricks on you. The more primed and focused you remain, the smoother you can deal with out-of-the-ordinary circumstances**.”

习惯的精准和具体化确保我们能够顶着压力完成任务。比尔·沃什是旧金山四九人队赫赫有名的前教练，他曾这样描述他的执教方法：“从头到尾，你的注意力必须放在做好事情上。包括每一次比赛，每一次训练，每一次会议，每一次情况，每分每秒。”他的方法可以应用在任何需要表现的领域。熟能生巧，但生巧的首要条件是练习的内容和方式是正确的。如果在放松状态或毫无压力时不能完成任务，那么在高度压力或面临危机时就更不可能完成。建立精准的仪式习惯能够抵抗压力产生的精力分散和恐惧。“在不利情况下，人们思考得越少，得到的结果越好，”沃什说，“当你处于压力之下，思维会给你添乱。你越是保持专注，越能更好地处理突发情况。”

Precision and specificity also help to assure that our rituals themselves remain fueled by our deepest values. It is not enough simply to create a vision statement. Only by building a ritual to regularly revisit this vision can we insure a strong, continuing connection to the unique source of energy such a statement provides. Pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson is a good example. “I have found that having a morning ritual—meditation or some quiet reading time—can set the tone for the whole day,” he explains. “Every morning, I spend a half hour reading the Bible, especially the Book of Proverbs. There’s so much wisdom there. During the day, if I encounter a frustrating situation. I think back to one of the verses that I read that morning. Take Proverbs 16:32, for example: ‘He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he who rules his spirit is better than he who takes a city.’”

精确性和具体性也能将习惯与价值观联系起来。仅仅构建愿景蓝图还不够，只有时常温习才能产生强大的意志精力。小儿神经外科医生本·卡森就是绝佳的例子。“我发现良好的晨间习惯——冥想或安静地阅读可以为一天定下良好的基调。每天早上我会用半个小时阅读《圣经》，尤其是《箴言》，里面蕴含了如此多的智慧。如果这天遇到了令人沮丧的情况，我就会回想早晨阅读的内容，例如箴言16章32节，‘不轻易发怒，胜过勇士；治服己心，强过夺城。’”

Our clients have found their own rituals to maintain their connection to the energy of purpose. Some spend a few minutes when they wake up writing in a journal. Others meditate or pray or read something inspirational or simply spend a few minutes in reflection while they are showering. Still others have their vision statements on the home page of their computers, or make it a practice during breaks to reflect on their values. One client had his personal and professional vision laminated on two sides of an index card and slipped it under the visor above his seat in his car. On his way to work in the morning, he spent a few minutes reviewing his professional vision. On his way home at night, he flipped the card and spent the last few minutes of his commute reflecting on his personal vision. **The key is not how we make the connection to our purpose. Rather it is assuring that we do so in a regular way**.

我们的客户都找到了自己的方式，重新找到生命意义的精力。有些人在起床后写日记，有些人冥想、祈祷或阅读鼓舞人心的文字，有些人在沐浴时思考人生，还有人将自己的构想蓝图设为电脑桌面，在空闲时间读读想想。有一位客户把他的生活理想和职业目标印在卡片的两面，夹在车里的遮阳板上面。每天早晨上班途中，他会拿出几分钟温习自己的职业目标；晚上下班途中，他把卡片翻到背面，阅读自己的人生理想。最重要的并不是我们沟通生命意义的方式，而是要养成重拾生命意义的习惯。

## DOING VS. NOT DOING

When intentions are framed negatively—“I won’t overeat” or “I will not get angry”—they rapidly deplete our limited stores of will and discipline. **Not doing something requires continuous self-control**. This is especially true of deeply ingrained habits and responses to temptations, such as eating desserts or drinking alcohol in a social situation. Designing a positive behavior to prepare for a particular situation is sometimes called “priming.” In the case of the temptation to overeat, for example, the priming ritual might be something like “When I am tempted by dessert, I will have a piece of fruit instead.”

当我们将某个意图以负面的方式表达出来——“我不会暴饮暴食”或“我不会生气”，就会很快地消耗掉意愿和自律的储备。“不做某些事”需要持续的自控力，尤其是面对原本的习惯和诱惑——例如吃甜点或在社交场合饮酒。为某一特定场合设计一种正面行为叫作“事前准备”。譬如，为了防止过度饮食，事前准备可以是“如果我感到了甜点的诱惑，就去吃一片水果”。

For years, George F., an executive at a small consulting company, struggled with an inclination to lose his temper whenever he felt frustrated or thwarted. It undermined his relationships at work, and because he considered kindness a primary value, it also made him feel bad about himself. As we looked more closely, it became clear that George was especially vulnerable to blowing up when he had worked long hours without a break, or failed to eat at regular intervals. Countless times he had committed to controlling his impulses, but within a few days, he always found himself reverting to his familiar pattern.

乔治是一家小型咨询公司的管理者，他很容易在沮丧或事情不顺利时发脾气，严重损坏了他工作中的人际关系。而且由于他把善良当作重要的价值观，他对自己也非常不满意。经过细致研究后我们发现，乔治的脾气在长时间工作或不能按时吃饭的情况下更容易爆发。他无数次下决心控制自己的冲动，但没过几天就回到了原来的行为模式。

Ensuring breaks and eating regularly represented a first intervention. Next, we suggested that George focus on the behavior he wanted to introduce into his life, rather than the one he hoped to resist. The first step was to get him to take several deep breaths as soon as he felt his anger rising and to resist saying anything in the moment. When he finally did speak, we suggested that George lower his voice. He had a tendency to speak louder as he became more aroused, which not only fueled his anger, but also pushed others away. Finally, we asked George to smile, even if it required a bit of acting at first. Considerable evidence suggests that smiling literally reduces arousal and short-circuits the “fight-or-flight” response. It is nearly impossible to smile and to feel angry at the same time.

他首先需要做的是适当休息和按时进食。接下来，我们建议乔治将注意力放在自己想要有的行为而不是想要抵制的行为上。如果他感到生气，首先进行深呼吸，什么话都不要说。最终开口时，我们建议他放低音量，因为情绪激动时他的声调会越来越高，无异于给情绪加了一把火，让别人更不愿意跟他交流。最后，我们要求乔治面带微笑，即使最初是装出来的微笑。有相当多的证据显示，微笑能够缓解焦虑，防止人们做出“非战即逃”的反应。毕竟，谁能够一边微笑一边生气呢。

Not surprisingly, George found this sequence of behaviors awkward and difficult at first. In several challenging situations, he simply forgot to do them at all. Within several weeks, however, the sequenced ritual had become nearly automatic in all but the most stressful circumstances. What George found most startling was that smiling in the face of frustration actually became a trigger to view the situation differently—more gently, less urgently and with a sense of humor.

毫无疑问，乔治起初觉得这些行为非常尴尬，做起来也非常困难。在某些极端情况下，他甚至忘得一干二净。然而没过几周，这些习惯就变成了自发反应，在情况非常严峻时才发生例外。乔治也发现，沮丧时保持微笑可以带给他看待的问题新角度——紧张感减少了，他的态度温和了，还有心情开开玩笑。

## INCREMENTAL CHANGE

If nothing succeeds like success, it is equally true that nothing fails like excess. Because change requires moving beyond our comfort zone, it is best initiated in small and manageable increments. Imagine that you decide, perhaps as a New Year’s resolution, to finally get in shape and start paying more attention to your physical health. Flush with resolve and enthusiasm, you join a gym and make a commitment to jog and to work out with weights three times a week. In the same spirit, you vow to begin a diet, reducing your caloric intake by half and cutting out all sugars and simple carbohydrates. Finally, you commit to getting more sleep at night and to waking up an hour earlier each morning. You even make very specific and precise plans about how to initiate your new program.

虽说有可能一顺百顺，也要注意过犹不及。做出改变需要跨出个人的安全区域，因而改变最好由浅入深。举个例子，你的新年愿望是瘦身和健康，于是你满怀决心和热情走进健身房，规定自己要经常慢跑，每周至少做3次举重训练。在同样的精神下，你打算节食，减少一半卡路里摄入量，抵制一切甜食和单糖化合物。最后，你决心晚上早睡，早晨提前1个小时起床。你甚至为自己的新生活做出了详细规划。

Within ten days, your diet has failed, you’ve only gotten to the gym twice and you haven’t changed your sleeping habits at all. What happened? The answer is that you took on too much, too quickly. Overwhelmed by the demands on your limited will and discipline, you rapidly depleted your self-regulatory reservoir. The result is not just that you failed to stick to your plan, but that you also likely fed your belief that it is impossible to change lifelong habits.

还不到10天时间，节食计划就泡汤了。只去了两次健身房，作息时间一点没变。为什么会这样？答案是你一次性设定了太多改变，远远超出个人意愿和自律的有限能力，所以很快又退回到原来的生活模式。你不仅仅没有坚持下来，还会告诉自己江山易改本性难移，原本的生活方式是不可能改变了。

Our method is to build rituals in increments—focusing on one significant change at a time, and setting reachable goals at each step of the process. If you have been completely sedentary and want to begin exercising, it doesn’t make sense to start by trying to jog three miles a day five days a week. Your odds of success are far higher if you begin with a highly specific but carefully calibrated training plan. That might mean walking for fifteen minutes a day three times a week at first, with predetermined increases in time or pace built in for each subsequent week. Growth and change won’t occur unless you push past your comfort zone, but pushing too hard increases the likelihood that you will give up. Far better to experience success at each step of a progressive process. Building confidence fuels the persistence to pursue more challenging changes. We call these “serial rituals.”

依我们的经验，你需要慢慢养成习惯——一次只关注一项重大变化，每一步都设定一个可行的目标。如果你一直久坐不动，打算开始锻炼身体，起初就设定每周五次、每次慢跑5公里是不现实的。高度细化、科学设定的训练计划会大大增加成功的可能性。比如，你可以最开始每周3次、每次步行15分钟，然后逐周增加步行时间或加快步伐。只有越过舒适区才能发生成长和改变，但是太过压迫也会增加放弃的概率。体验阶段性成功是个更好的选择，它能帮你建立自信、增强耐性，寻求更具挑战性的改变。我们称之为“串联仪式习惯”。

## BASIC TRAINING

In the Resources section, you will find the Full Engagement Personal Development Plan, which will take you step-by-step through the process for identifying your key values, developing a vision, creating rituals that address your primary performance barriers and holding yourself accountable each day to your commitments. Two behaviors, we have found, dramatically increase the likelihood of successfully locking in new rituals during the typical thirty-to sixty-day acquisition period. We call these behaviors **Basic Training**. They serve as the ground upon which successful rituals are most effectively built.

在本书的《实用资料》部分，你会找到“个人精力管理计划”，它会带着你一步一步走完全程，包括确定重要价值观、构建预想，针对你的首要表现障碍建立习惯，为自己的行为承担责任。我们发现，有两种细节能够明显增加一个周期里30～60天仪式习惯的成功率。我们称作**基本训练**，它们是建立新仪式习惯的基础。

**Chart the Course.** This practice can take many forms, but the aim is always the same: to launch each day’s ritual-acquisition mission by revisiting our vision, clarifying not just what we intend to accomplish, but how we want to conduct ourselves along the way. Some of our clients find that they can do this in as little as five or ten minutes while others set aside a half hour or more. Some clients chart the course in the shower, while others sit in a quiet room at home or do it during a walk or a jog outdoors or even while commuting to work.

规划方式：它的形式丰富多变，但本质相同：每天设定养成习惯的任务，重复预想，明确目标，设定自己的相应行为。有些客户只需5～10分钟就能完成，有些人需要半个小时或者更多。有些人可以在沐浴的时候进行，有些人需要在安静的房间里，或在散步、慢跑甚至坐车上班的时候思考。

Charting the course may include different elements. Some clients find it most effective to connect to specific deeply held values such as generosity, empathy, honesty or confidence and to use them as fuel for instituting a particular behavior or achieving a specific goal. Others find it most powerful to actively imagine how they will handle potentially difficult challenges in the day ahead. Still others simply like to set aside a designated block of time when they get up to reflect on their vision for themselves. This may take the form of writing in a journal or meditation or prayer.

路线规划包含许多不同的因素。对有些客户来说，与慷慨、共情、诚实或自信等价值观沟通在支持某种特定行为或达成某个具体目标时更有效。有些人认为提前预判可能出现的挑战或困难更有用，也有人喜欢起床之后空出一段时间，通过日记、冥想或祈祷的形式思考构想。

Sally F. worked at an inner-city public school. For all the idealism that drew her to teaching, she spent much of her day disciplining her students and trying to keep order in her classroom. She decided to institute a morning ritual to stimulate positive feelings about her work in order to offset frustration and increase her positive energy. After completing our training, she began launching each day by reconnecting with the importance of her four primary values: patience, respect for others, gratitude and humility.

萨莉在城区的一所公立学校上班。她坚持自己投身教学事业的热情，一天里大部分时间都在管教学生，试图规范课堂纪律。她决定建立自己的晨间模式，促进自己对工作的积极想法，抵消挫败感，并获得更多积极精力。结束我们的培训课程后，她每天都要温习自己最重要的价值观：耐心，尊重他人，心怀感激和谦逊。

On stressful days, it had always been difficult for Sally to resist succumbing to negative emotions. Living by a code of conduct about how to manage her energy—establishing rules of engagement—grounded Sally in her deepest values and helped her to keep discouragement at bay. When her energy flowed more from a positive sense of appreciation for the opportunity that teaching provided, Sally not only felt more patient and balanced but also found that she had a more uplifting and inspiring impact on her students.

压力特别大的时候，萨莉总是很难抵抗负面的情绪。然而，在植根于深层价值观的精力管理准则的引导下，建立投入的规则，能够避免消极情绪。当她的动力源自对教学机会的感激之情，她不仅能够变得更加耐心、心平气和，对学生们也会产生更为积极的影响和启发。

**Chart the Progress.** The second key to building rituals that lead to sustaining change is holding yourself accountable at the end of each day. Accountability is a means of regularly facing the truth about the gap between your intention and your actual behavior. If you are trying to eat a healthier diet, it is critical to have rituals that define what and when you are going to eat, but also to measure at the end of each day how well you’ve followed your plan. If you have built a ritual around treating others with more respect, it is important to keep track of how effectively you are meeting that goal. The same is true for any endeavor to which you have committed yourself. Defining a desired outcome and holding yourself accountable each day gives focus and direction to the rituals that you build. For many of our clients, the best way to do this is to create a daily accountability log. This exercise can be as simple as a yes or no check on a sheet kept by the side of your bed. (See Resources for a sample Accountability Log.)

记录进展：若想变革持久，第二个关键要素是每天进行行为自查。自查可以帮助你看到个人预想和实际行为的差距。如果你打算开启健康饮食的计划，不仅要明确规定进食的时间和内容，还要在晚上核查自己一天的表现是否完全遵守计划。如果你打算养成尊重他人的习惯，检查自己在日常生活中是否完成目标也很重要。设立任何目标都需要这个过程。设定目标并每天检查自己的成果会为你的仪式习惯指明专注点方向。对于很多客户来说，自查日志是最简单的形式，只需要你在床头放一张每日自查表，每天在上面打钩画叉就可以了。（详见实用资料部分的自查日志范例）

“It’s great to know how to recharge your batteries, but it’s even more important that you actually do it,” Vinod Khosla, a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield and Byers told Fast Company. “I track how many times I get home in time to have dinner with my family. My assistant reports the exact number to me each month. Your company measures its priorities. People also need to place metrics around their priorities. . . . My goal is to be home for dinner twenty-five nights a month. Having a target number is key. . . . Keeping track of your behavior each month means that you don’t slip up, because you know immediately whether your schedule is matching up with your priorities.”

“了解充电方法很重要，但是付诸行动更重要。”美国KPCB风险投资公司的合伙人维诺德·科斯拉在《快公司》杂志的采访中说。“我会留心自己每周有多少次准时到家、与家人共进晚餐，助手会把每月的具体数字报告给我。公司会为目标划分轻重缓急，人们的生活也是一样……我的目标是每月准时回家吃晚餐的次数达到25次。树立明确的目标是关键……每月记录意味着你不会轻易忘记，从日程上就可以看出这个目标的完成情况。”

Holding your own feet to the fire doesn’t require judging or punishing yourself when you fall short. Negative motivation, as we have seen, is short-lived and energy draining. At its best, accountability is both a protection against our infinite capacity for self-deception and a source of information about what still stands in our way. If you are falling short in implementing a particular ritual or achieving the outcome that you are seeking, several explanations are possible. It may be that the ritual isn’t grounded in a value or a vision that is truly compelling to you. It may be the goal that you set is simply too ambitious and needs to be implemented more slowly and progressively. It could also be that the ritual you put in place is faulty and needs to be restructured. Often, the failure to follow through on a new ritual masks the benefit that you derive from holding on to an existing behavior and an unacknowledged resistance to changing it. Whatever the explanation, measuring your progress at the end of the day should be used not as a weapon against yourself, but as an instructive part of the change process. We can derive as much value from studying and understanding our failures as we can from celebrating and reinforcing our successes.

给自己施压并不意味着在达不到目标时批判或惩罚自己。负面动力效果短暂，并且会耗费精力。责任感既能防止我们施展无穷的自我欺骗手段，又能让我们了解面前的阻碍。如果你没能建立某个仪式习惯或达到某个目标，原因可能有很多方面。也许它没能联结你的重要价值观，或是你的构想太过逼迫自己。也许你一次性树立的目标太过远大，需要划分成多个阶段；也有可能是这个仪式习惯本身存在问题，需要再度调整。不论是何种理由，每天评估自己并非是为了跟自己做对，而是改变过程中很有帮助的一部分。对于失败的研究和分析与庆祝和巩固成功具有同样的价值。
