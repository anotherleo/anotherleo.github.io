# The Reengaged Life of Roger B.

Roger B. was an unusually challenging client. It wasn’t that his performance barriers were significantly more daunting than those we typically face. Rather his initial motivation to change was so low.

罗杰是一位情况棘手的客户，并非因为他的表现障碍比我们遇到的其他情况更难缠，而是因为他明显缺乏改变的动机。

Not surprisingly, Roger arrived at our center with a chip on his shoulder. His boss had done his best to frame his visit to us as an opportunity, but Roger couldn’t help but feel that he had been singled out. He was late getting his pre-training materials to us, he wore his skepticism openly through much of the first day and he spent every break in our parking lot on his cell phone or answering emails on his BlackBerry. It was not an auspicious start.

我们能感受到，罗杰来到培训中心时很不乐意，即使他的老板已经尽力将我们的课程包装成一次培训机会，他还是认为老板在针对自己。他迟交了前期材料，第一天就把怀疑写在脸上，课间休息时都在停车场用黑莓手机打电话或发邮件。这样的开头可不算理想。

As Roger moved through our Face the Truth process, he was clearly unsettled by what he was hearing. We consider that a hopeful sign. Until clients feel some discomfort about their current circumstances, they are rarely inclined to change. The first surprise for Roger was his physical testing results. He had continued to think of himself as being in relatively decent shape, but he was relying mostly on past memories. It hadn’t occurred to him how much atrophy occurs over two decades of relative inactivity. He was discouraged to find how high his body fat percentage was and how low his cardiovascular capacity and strength were. He was also shocked when we told him that his risk factors—elevated blood pressure, relatively high alcohol consumption, chronic high stress, moderate smoking, high cholesterol and excess weight—made him a prime candidate for an early heart attack. It was true, he acknowledged, that his doctor had encouraged him to lose weight and to exercise more regularly, but Roger had never sensed that there was any urgency.

进入面对事实的环节，罗杰显然被我们的理论扰乱了心绪。我们将它当作一个积极的信号，因为客户只有对现状感到不适时才会产生改变的意愿。第一个令罗杰惊讶的是他的体能测试报告。他一直认定自己身形良好，脑海里还是年轻时的印象。他不知道20年的怠惰已经造成了怎样的后果。看到自己极高的体脂比例、低下的心脑血管能力和体能时，他非常沮丧。我们告诉他，他的种种状况——升高的血压、较高的酒精摄入量、长期压力过大、轻度吸烟、高胆固醇和超重——极易诱发早期心脏病时，他显得非常震惊。他承认医生也曾鼓励他减重、定期运动，但罗杰从来没有意识到改变自身的紧迫性。

He was also surprised and a bit defensive about some of the feedback that he received from colleagues on his Full Engagement Inventory—most notably that they found him to be highly critical, impatient and short-tempered. While Roger admitted that he felt irritable and negative at times, he believed that he hid it well and that he generally treated others with respect and kindness. “These are tough times,” he explained. “I think a lot of my people just aren’t used to being under the kind of pressures we’re facing, and they’re blaming the messenger.”

在全情投入问卷上看到同事的反馈，他有些惊讶，也有些不满。他的同事们将他描述为“吹毛求疵”“急躁”“急脾气”。虽然罗杰承认自己有时会暴躁、消极，但他坚信自己已经很好地将这些情绪隐藏起来，表现出的都是尊重他人、平易和善的一面。“我的处境也很尴尬，”他解释说，“我认为我的下属无法适应上面的压力，所以他们会责怪传达任务的人。”

Roger’s first real breakthrough occurred when we asked him whether his wife or children would describe him as impatient and irritable. He seemed to visibly shrink in his chair. Just a few weeks earlier, he told us, there had been an incident with Alyssa, his nine-year-old daughter. After picking her up at a Saturday gymnastics class, he had taken her out for lunch at a local restaurant—a rare occasion for the two of them to have time together alone. Alyssa was wearing a hand-knit sweater that Roger’s mother had recently given her as a present. In the middle of lunch, Alyssa accidentally knocked over a glass of tomato juice and it got all over her new sweater.

当我们问他，妻子或孩子是否也曾形容他“不耐烦”和“急躁”时，才迎来了第一个突破口。我们眼看着他萎缩在椅子里。他告诉我们就在几周前，他和9岁的艾莉莎之间发生了这样一件事。当时他从周六的体操课接上她，带她去餐馆吃午饭。这是罕见的父女相处时间。艾莉莎穿着一件手工编织的毛衣——罗杰的妈妈新近送给她的礼物，在午餐时她不小心打翻了碟子，番茄酱全都倒在了新毛衣上。

Roger reacted angrily, chastising his daughter for her carelessness. Alyssa tried to apologize but Roger only became more angry. Eventually she began to sob. “All you ever do is yell at me,” she said between tears. “Why do you hate me so much?” It was as if she had put a knife to his heart, Roger told us. Instantly, he realized that he had overreacted, taking out on Alyssa all the frustration and anxiety he was feeling at work. Worse yet, he realized that his daughter was right about his behavior. In the relatively little time that they spent together, he was often critical and impatient with her. The more he talked about it, the more he realized that the same was true with his younger daughter and with his wife as well. Perhaps, he told us, his colleagues were onto something about his behavior.

罗杰立刻就动了怒，指责女儿的粗心大意。艾莉莎一直道歉，但罗杰却越来越生气。最后小女孩哭了起来。“你就知道吼我，”她边哭边说，“你怎么那么讨厌我？”罗杰告诉我们，他听到女儿的话时仿佛在心上插了一把刀，意识到自己反应过激了，把工作中的沮丧和焦虑都发泄了在女儿身上。更糟糕的是，女儿并没有说错。在他们少得可怜的相聚时间里，他总是对她挑三拣四，很不耐烦。他越讲越意识到，自己对妻子和小女儿也是一样的态度。他说，或许他的同事也发现了他行为方面的某些问题。

## PURPOSE AS A FUEL

For the work of defining purpose, Roger’s first evening homework assignment was to answer a series of questions designed to help him surface his most deeply held values. As we noted earlier, one of the questions we ask is: “Jump ahead to the end of your life: What are the three most important lessons you have learned?” Difficult as his life had become, Roger was not an especially complicated man. These were his answers:

在明确目标阶段，罗杰第一项晚间作业就是回答问题，找到自己最重视的价值观。其中一个问题是：“如果现在就是人生的尽头，你学到的最重要的3个道理是什么？”虽然生活已经很艰难，但罗杰是个复杂的人。下面是他的答案：

1. Marry someone you love and respect and always make your family your highest priority. Everything else comes and goes, but your closest relationships are forever. 与所爱之人组成家庭，把家人放在首要位置。身外之物总是来了又走，只有亲密关系才会永恒。

2. Work hard, keep your standards high, and never settle for anything less than you are capable of achieving. 努力工作，高标准要求自己，永远不要在能力范围内退而求其次。

3. Treat other people with respect and kindness. 尊重并善待他人。

The disparity between the story that Roger had told us the previous day and the lessons that he hoped to impart to his children didn’t escape his notice. “I know I probably sound like a hypocrite,” he said, “but even if I fall short, these really are the lessons I want to pass along to my kids.” To the second query, “Think of someone you deeply respect. Describe the qualities you admire in this person,” Roger chose his father, who it turned out had been a tailor and had later owned a dry cleaning business.

罗杰讲述的那次经历与他希望传授给孩子们的道理相去甚远，他也意识到了这点。“我知道我听起来很像个伪君子，”他说，“但即使我没能做到，我还是希望把这些道理讲给我的孩子。”第二个问题是：“想想一个你非常尊重的人，描述他身上你最钦佩的品质”，罗杰选择了他的父亲，一位老人，从裁缝做起，最后拥有了自己的干洗店。

“I always admired his dignity and his gentleness and his integrity,” Roger said. “He took great pride in his work, and he treated every one of his customers with interest and respect. He was the same way in our family. He never seemed to get frustrated or upset, even though he worked very long hours.” As to who he has at his best, Roger described himself as “fun-loving, caring, dedicated, creative and totally reliable.”

“我总是很钦佩他的尊严、温柔和正直，”罗杰说。“他为自己的工作骄傲，诚心对待并尊重每位顾客。他对家人也是一样，即使工作了很久也从不发火。”而对于“最好的自我”，罗杰则这样描述“风趣，关心他人，充满奉献精神，创意丰富，值得信赖”。

When it came to selecting his top five values, they weren’t entirely surprising: kindness, excellence, family, integrity and health. “I think the first four were all strongly influenced by my parents,” Roger told us. “In all honesty, I probably wouldn’t have put health on my list before doing this program. But now that I see how much I’ve put myself at risk and what the consequences could be, health seems a lot more important than it did before.

在列举重要价值观时，他的回答也在意料之中——善良、卓越、家庭、正直和健康。“前四项是受到我父母的影响，”罗杰说。“老实说，在这次培训课程之前，我可能不会把健康排在前面。但现在我意识到自己的身体状况有多大的风险，可能会遭受怎样的病痛，保持健康看起来是迫在眉睫的事。”

The final step in defining purpose is to write a vision statement. This was Roger’s:

确立生命意义的最后一步是构建自己的蓝图。他是这样写的：

> My highest priority in life is my wife and my children. When we are together, I am committed to giving them all of my energy and attention To make that possible, I must also take care of myself physically. At work, I hold myself to a high standard of excellence. As a leader I model each of my primary values—most of all kindness, concern for others and integrity. I make others feel cared for and confident that they can count on me. Whatever I do, I do wholeheartedly.
>
> 我的生命中最重要的是我的妻子和孩子。在我们团聚的时刻，我承诺献出自己的所有精力和关注。为了做到这一点，我必须照顾好自己的身体。在工作中，我要严格要求自己。作为领导者，我要表现出自己的价值观——善良、关心他人和正直。我要让他人感到备受关心，让他们感觉可以放心依靠我。不管我做什么事情，都要全心全意。

When it came time to build an action plan, Roger focused both on his primary values and on the performance barriers he had identified: low energy, impatience, negativity, lack of depth in relationships and lack of passion. He was reluctant to take on too much for fear of failing. We agreed. As we have pointed out, it is far better to succeed with small incremental changes and modest setbacks than to create a grand plan and fail completely. Roger decided to build his first set of rituals around increasing his physical capacity, not just to improve his health, but also on the theory that insufficient energy was a factor in every one of his performance issues.

接下来设定行动计划。罗杰需要把关注点集中在重要价值观和表现障碍（精力低下、急躁、消极、缺乏深度人际关系、缺乏热情）两个方面。因为害怕失败，他不愿一次改变太多，我们也赞成由浅入深的改变比宏大的计划更容易成功。罗杰决定围绕着加强身体素质建立第一组习惯，不仅为了改善健康，还因为体能不足是所有表现障碍的诱因。

The first ritual Roger created was to work out at least three times a week—Tuesdays and Fridays at 1:00 P.M. and Saturday mornings at 10:00 A.M. He also committed to a healthy, high-protein breakfast every day and to eating smaller, more nutritious meals at regular intervals throughout the day. The second area in which he hoped to build a ritual was spending more time with his family. The best he could come up with by the time he finished our training was to try to leave work no later than 6:30 P.M. each day and to limit dinners with clients to no more than two a week. He wanted to talk with his wife before devising more specific plans. Just making these changes, Roger believed, would have a significant impact on his energy, his relationships and his attitude at work. After two and a half days with us, he left feeling excited and enthusiastic about the challenge ahead.

他计划每周至少健身3次，分别在周二、周五下午1点和周六早上10点。他也打算安排营养丰富、高蛋白的早餐，并在具体时段少量加餐。第二步是腾出时间陪伴家人。罗杰决定每天6点半之前结束工作，把陪客户吃饭的时间控制在每周两次以内。具体的细节他想跟妻子一起商量。罗杰相信，这些改变会给他的精力水平、人际关系和工作态度带来显著变化。在与我们相处两天半之后，他重新对未来的挑战燃起了热情。

## HEADING HOME

Just before getting on the plane home from his training, Roger checked in to see what awaited him at work. He had 134 emails, forty-five voice mails and a half dozen small work crises that demanded his attention. To his dismay, he barely had time to say hello to his wife and children on the evening that he returned. After a quick hello, he disappeared into his home office and turned his attention to putting out fires at work. The next morning, he got up an hour earlier than usual and left before his family awoke, skipping his planned breakfast. Instead he gobbled down a donut and coffee from the deli next to his office. Roger spent the next four hours juggling a dozen issues and trying to catch up on calls and correspondence. For lunch, he grabbed the most convenient item—two slices of pizza from the cafeteria, which he ate at his desk. His first scheduled midday workout went by the wayside, and he rescheduled it in his mind for the next day. He had promised Rachel that he would try to get home early after three nights away, but by the time he forced himself to leave work, it was already 7:30 P.M.

培训结束后，罗杰在登机返家之前检查了积累下来的工作。 134封邮件， 45条语音信息和一堆等他解决的小问题。令他失望的是，回到家的那个晚上他几乎没时间问候妻子和孩子们，简单打了招呼就钻进了家里的办公室开始救火。第二天，他比平常早起了1个小时，在家人起床之前就出门了。他没有按制订的计划吃早餐，而是用办公室附近买来的甜甜圈和咖啡解决了问题。接下来的4个小时里，罗杰一边处理事务，一边尽力回复电话和邮件。中午，他选择了最方便的食物——餐厅买来的两块披萨，在办公桌前解决午餐。第一天的锻炼计划被丢在一旁，他决定明天补上。他答应瑞秋尽早回家，但是等他强迫自己从办公桌前站起来时已经晚上7点半了。

On his commute home, feeling exhausted and discouraged, Roger began to brood. There was no way out, he decided. For all his optimistic plans, he was right back where he started. He wasn’t going to arrive home before 8:30 P.M., he was certain that Rachel would be angry with him and he wasn’t going to have much time or energy for his kids. A pile of work in his briefcase still demanded his attention.

在回家的路上，满身疲倦、心灰意冷的罗杰开始感到悲观。这样是行不通的，他想。尽管制订了那么多乐观的计划，他第一天就回到了原点。他没能在8点半之前到家，瑞秋肯定会对他发脾气。他也没有时间和精力陪伴孩子们了，还有一摞文件静静地躺在他的公文包里，等待他来处理。

When he got off the Interstate at his exit, Roger felt a surge of emotion that he couldn’t fully understand. As he passed a local park five blocks from his house, the feelings inside him became so overwhelming that he couldn’t continue driving. To his astonishment, the moment he pulled his car over, tears began to stream down his face. The last time he remembered crying was at his wedding twelve years earlier, and those had been tears of joy. These tears, he realized, were a reflection of some deep sadness about his life, and he had been holding them in for a long time. It occurred to Roger that what he really wanted to do was to go home and hug his wife and children and tell them how much he loved them and missed them.

车子下了州际公路，他突然产生了一种难以言说的情绪。路过自家附近的公园时，这种情绪变得如此强烈，他几乎无法继续驾驶，只有在路边停下来。让他惊讶的是，车子停下时，眼泪瞬间夺眶而出，源源不断地顺着脸颊往下流。他记得自己上一次哭泣还是在12年前的婚礼上，那是幸福的眼泪。而现在，在他心底积蓄已久的眼泪只能折射出生活中深深的悲哀。他现在只想回家拥抱妻子和孩子，告诉他们自己多爱他们、多想念他们。

Roger drove the last several blocks home feeling lighter and more buoyant. As he opened the front door, he called out for his children and his wife, but no one answered. He looked in the kitchen and the playroom to no avail. Rachel had long ago taught the children to give their father a wide berth on the nights that he arrived home late, knowing he would likely be feeling exhausted and irritable. On this occasion, however, Roger bounded up the stairs and found his girls playing together in Alyssa’s room. The moment he saw them, he knelt down, held out his arms and they came running to him. He scooped them up and the tears began to stream down his face again. Moments later, Rachel walked in. She stopped in the doorway and a horrified look crossed her face.

罗杰再次上路，心头轻松了许多。他一开门就呼唤妻子和孩子，却没有回应。他在厨房和游戏室也没找到她们。瑞秋早就教会孩子们，如果父亲回来晚了，多半是疲倦而焦躁的模样，一定要留给他空间。罗杰跑上楼，发现女儿们正在艾莉莎的房间里玩耍。看到她们那一刻，他跪下来，张开手臂，女儿们欢呼着跑进父亲的怀里。他把她们抱起来，眼泪又开始止不住地往下流。不一会儿，瑞秋进来了。她停在门口，惊慌失措。

“Oh my God,” she said, “don’t tell me. You’ve been fired.”

“天啊，”她说，“等一下，你被炒鱿鱼了？”

Roger smiled through his tears. “No,” he said, “it isn’t that. I’m just so happy to see everyone.”

罗杰破涕为笑。“不是的。我只是很高兴见到你们。”

The next morning Roger woke up feeling better than he had in years. He had breakfast with Rachel before the children got up. His morning at work was intense, but he forced himself to stick with his plan to exercise during his lunch hour at the health club near his office. It was the first time he had used the membership since a week after Rachel gave it to him for Christmas eight months earlier. When he finished his workout, Roger was physically tired but emotionally exhilarated. Instead of opting for a hamburger and fries at a fast-food restaurant near his office, he stopped at the local gourmet deli and made himself a light lunch from the salad bar. During the afternoon, he was less fatigued than he could remember feeling in a long time. At 6:30 sharp, he left for home.

第二天，罗杰起床后感受到了从未有过的轻松。孩子们起床之前，他跟妻子一起吃了早餐。上午依旧繁忙，但他强迫自己中午按计划去健身房锻炼。这是他收到妻子的圣诞礼物以来第二次使用健身卡。锻炼之后他很疲倦，精神却很振奋。他没有去快餐店买汉堡薯条，而是去熟食店买了一份沙拉。下午他感觉到了久违的振奋。 6点半他准时离开了办公室。

As Roger approached the park near his house, he felt the same surge of emotion that he had the previous evening, and for a second time, he was compelled to pull over. To his utter amazement, his eyes again filled with tears, and the same intense desire to be with his family arose. This time when he walked into his house, he found his two daughters in the playroom. He held out his arms as they came running to him and once again he began to weep.

当罗杰再次路过公园，昨晚那种熟悉的感觉又包围了他。他不得不再次停下车，惊讶地发现眼泪再次涌上来，对家人的思念和渴望也再次升起。走进家门，女儿们在游戏室。他张开手臂，孩子们跑过来，他开始哭泣。

“Mommy,” Alyssa yelled, “Daddy’s crying again.”

“妈妈！”艾莉莎大叫，“爸爸又哭啦。”

## THE TRANSFORMATION

During the next six months, Roger was able to count on one hand the number of times that he returned home from work and failed to stop his car for at least a few minutes at the park near his house. The tears subsided, but the predictable surge of emotion did not. Stopping at the park became a ritual that permitted Roger to make a profound transition. Each time he parked his car, he left his work behind and took time to reconnect with why his family mattered so much to him and who he wanted to be when he was with them. For years, returning home at the end of the workday had felt like stepping from one set of exhausting demands into another. Now he began to experience his family as a powerful source of renewal. He became impeccable about his commitment to leave work by 6:30 P.M. and about his workouts.

在接下来6个月的时间里，罗杰每次下班回家几乎都会在公园附近停留片刻。眼泪虽然已经慢慢平息，但涌动的情感依然强烈。在公园停下成为罗杰的习惯，帮助他完成从工作到家庭的转变。每一次车子停下来，他就将工作抛之脑后，回想起家人对他多么重要，回想起自己希望如何陪伴家人。几年以来，回家对罗杰来说仿佛是从一个漩涡掉入另一个漩涡，他眼中只有无穷无尽的索求；而现在，他开始体会到家庭带来的积极精力。他每天6点半准时下班，午间的锻炼计划也坚持下来。

Three weeks after returning home, Roger instituted a second ritual around his children. Because he left each morning before they awoke, he decided to write each of them a note each day and slip it under their doors. It was a way to connect with his daughters, even though he didn’t see actually them, and to affirm their importance in his life. It also became a source of pleasure on its own terms. Some days, he wrote what he called “Roger’s Rules of Order,” usually in the form of short fables that he made up. On Sunday nights, he drew each of them a cartoon strip—something he had done for his college newspaper, but never since. When he was traveling, he sent an email to both girls in the mornings. Roger realized how important these rituals had become to his daughters one morning when he was rushed and failed to push a note under their doors. When he returned home that evening, both girls were waiting for him at the door with their arms folded. “Daddy, you forgot something this morning,” Alyssa said.

课程结束3周后，罗杰开始围绕孩子建立第二个仪式习惯。因为他每天在孩子们醒来之前就上班了，他决定每天给她们每人写一条留言，从门缝底下塞进去。这是与女儿们建立联系的方式，即使他不能时时刻刻见到她们，也要让女儿知道她们对自己的生命很重要。这个过程本身也充满了乐趣。有时候，他会在题目上写“罗杰的命令”，里面是他编出来的寓言故事。周日晚上，他会给孩子们画连环画——以前在大学报社画过，离校后就再也没有动过笔。如果碰上出差，他会在早晨给女儿们发邮件。有一天他走得匆忙，忘记往孩子的房门下塞纸条。晚上下班回来，两个女儿就在门口抱着手臂等他。“爸爸，你今天早上忘了些事情。”艾莉莎说。他这才发现这个仪式习惯对孩子们来说多么重要。

Roger also instituted a morning ritual of eating breakfast with his wife—alternating oatmeal, egg-white omelets and a protein drink. Eating at home also gave him an opportunity to spend time with Rachel before the kids got up. The chance to connect for a few minutes of uninterrupted time each morning very quickly became precious to both of them. It was far more enriching than sitting in silence behind a morning newspaper. Instead, he spent three minutes skimming the headlines and saved a more careful reading for the evening after his kids were in bed. Within a couple of weeks, Roger felt a dramatic upturn in the quality and the quantity of his energy, both at home and at work.

罗杰还建立了与妻子共进早餐的仪式习惯，分享麦片、蛋饼和蛋白质饮料。这段时间让他能在孩子们起床前陪伴瑞秋，度过一段不受打扰的二人时光，比沉默地读报有意义得多。他早晨只花3分钟浏览头条新闻，晚上孩子们上床睡觉后他再仔细阅读其他版面。几周后，不论是工作还是在家，罗杰的精力质量和水平都有了飞速提升。

Over the next couple of months, Roger launched two other rituals. The first was devoting the final fifteen minutes of his morning commute to thinking through the day ahead and revisiting his primary values. The second was making a call during his commute home to someone he cared about—his father and mother, one of his two siblings, or a friend. He could tell that his parents deeply appreciated hearing from him more often. The routine also became a great way to rekindle his connection with a good friend who had lived next door but had moved away the previous year. It turned out that the friend commuted home most nights at the same time that Roger did, and they began speaking for fifteen or twenty minutes, cell phone to cell phone, at least once a week.

在接下来的几个月里，罗杰还建立了另外两个仪式习惯。第一个是在上班途中最后15分钟里提前规划好一天的任务，重温自己的价值取向。第二个是晚上下班途中给自己关心的人打电话——父母，兄弟姐妹，或者朋友。他发现父母非常乐意跟他时常通话，他也重新联系上了从前的一位邻居兼好友。罗杰惊讶地发现，原来他和他的朋友经常走同一条路上下班。他们每次都会聊15～20分钟，每周至少通话一次。

Roger was also successful in sticking to his workout regimen. Within a month, he expanded it from three days to four, adding Sunday afternoons. Initially, he had planned just one workout on the weekends. He offered to take responsibility for the kids on the other day so that Rachel could have a couple of hours to work out herself. She was reluctant to be away from the children more than she already was during the week. Roger argued that she needed some time for herself and that working out would give her more positive energy when she was with them. Rachel finally suggested a compromise. It turned out that the local YMCA provided child care for parents using the facility, and so they joined as a family. Roger and Rachel began working out together on Saturday afternoons, and they brought their kids along. On Sunday at midday, Rachel went to work out by herself, while Roger took the girls out for brunch.

罗杰也成功地坚持了自己的健身计划。第一个月里，他就把每周锻炼的次数从3次增加到4次，加上了星期天下午。最初他计划周末只锻炼一次，另一天用来照顾孩子，让瑞秋也能出去锻炼。但瑞秋自己更愿意用周末陪伴孩子。罗杰劝说她也需要个人时间，锻炼可以提高她的精力水平，让她陪伴孩子时更有精力。最后瑞秋找到了一个两全其美的办法。当地的青年教会能帮助参加健身的父母照顾孩子，所以罗杰全家一起报了名。罗杰和瑞秋每周六下午都会带着孩子一起健身。星期天中午，瑞秋单独外出健身，罗杰自己带着两个女儿出去吃饭。

These rituals around working out, eating better and spending more focused time with his family were the primary ones that Roger undertook during the two months after he visited with us. While none of them related directly to his job, the changes he made not only influenced how he felt physically and his relationship with his family but also affected his productivity at the office. Feeling more positive and more energized, Roger became less edgy at work and he was able to concentrate better, especially in the afternoons after his workouts. Because he was getting more done in less time, he felt comfortable about leaving work earlier. At least twice a week he was out the door by 5:30 P.M. and home by 6:30—a full hour earlier than at any point since he started his job a decade earlier. Eight weeks after he left us, we got a call from Roger’s boss. “I don’t know how you did it, but the guy is reborn,” he told us. “It’s like he’s ten years younger and all fired up again.”

建立健身、饮食和陪伴家人的习惯是罗杰前两个月的首要任务。即使这些习惯并不与工作直接相关，但它们不但改善了罗杰的体能和家庭关系，还提高了他在办公室的效率。因为心态变得积极、精力更加充沛，罗杰在工作中也收起了棱角，注意力更加集中了，尤其是健身过后的下午。因为他能用更少的时间完成更多的任务，也有了提早下班的充分理由。每周至少两次他能在下午5点半出门， 6点半到家——比他10年来的下班时间整整提前了一个小时。课程结束8周后，我们接到了罗杰老板的电话。“我不知道你们怎么做到的，这个人简直像重生了一样，好像一下子年轻了10岁，重新充满了干劲。”

## GOING DEEPER

At three months, Roger began instituting several more rituals that were part of the second phase of his initial Action Plan. (See full plan in the Resources section that follows this chapter.) One was to better prioritize his work. Before coming to us, Roger had typically spent the first hour at the office answering emails and calls. Now, like many of our clients he committed himself to a routine of putting off responding to email and voice mail each morning until he first addressed at least one important, longer-range challenge.

课程结束3个月的时候，即行动计划的第二阶段，罗杰开始培养更多的习惯。（详见资料部分的完整计划。）其中一项是为工作事务划分优先级。参加培训课程之前，罗杰到办公室的头一个小时基本都用来回复邮件和电话。现在，就像其他客户一样，罗杰决定将这些应答事务推后，先来攻克至少一件重要的、长期的任务。

His second ritual focused on being more rigorous about his breaks. While he had become meticulous about stopping at precisely 1:00 P.M. on the two days that he exercised, he still tended to work continuously for as much as three to four hours at a stretch. Roger decided to build in one recovery break in the morning and one in the afternoon. Browsing in bookstores was one of his favorite activities, and he began using his morning break to walk to the Barnes & Noble three blocks from his office and spending fifteen minutes there. In the afternoons, he used his break to check in with his girls as they returned home from school and then to do ten minutes of deep breathing at his desk. He also shifted his afternoon snack from a candy bar to half of an energy bar, a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts.

第二个仪式习惯是严格执行间断休息。虽然他现在能每周两天准时在下午1点去健身房锻炼，但他还是会一口气工作三四个小时。罗杰决定在上午和下午各安排一段休息时间。逛书店是他的最爱，于是在上午的休息时间他会步行到公司附近的巴诺书店，在书店里待上15分钟。下午的休息时间里，他会给放学回家的女儿们打电话，然后在桌边做10分钟的深呼吸练习。下午的零食也从一条糖果变成了半条能量棒、一片水果和一把坚果。

The third ritual that Roger launched was to have a lunch with one of his direct reports every week—an outgrowth both of having defined kindness and respect for others as a primary value and a response to the feedback that he was critical and impatient. On the occasions that he felt it was important to give some kind of critical feedback, he made it a practice to begin and end by saying something positive.

第三个习惯是每周和一位直接下属共进午餐，既符合罗杰价值观里的善待并尊重他人，也能解决下属对他“挑剔” “急躁”的评价。如果要给予批评，他会使用“三明治原则”，从正面评价开始，以正面评价结束。

At six months, Roger returned to our facility for a follow-up. From the moment that he walked in the door, it was clear that he had changed in significant ways. He looked healthier but also more animated, engaged and upbeat. The physical changes were immediately measurable. Roger had lost twelve pounds. His body-fat percentage had declined from 27 to 19 percent. His cholesterol level had dropped from 245 to 185 and his blood pressure was well within the normal range. When we tested him, his endurance had increased by almost 25 percent and his strength by 35 percent. We also asked Roger to rate his level of engagement. Where he had put it at 5 at work and a 3 at home six months earlier, he now put it at 9 for both.

6个月之后，罗杰来到我们的训练中心作后续报告。从进门那刻，很容易感受到他整个人发生了重大的变化。他看起来更健康了，更有活力，思维更专注，情绪也更加积极。身体上的变化显而易见。他的体重减轻12磅，体脂比例从27%降至19%，胆固醇含量从245降到185，血压也在正常范围之内。在随后的延展测试中，他的耐力提升了25%，力量增强了35%。我们请罗杰为他的专注度打分， 6个月前他给工作打了5分，家庭打了3分，如今他给二者都打了9分。

## BUMPS IN THE ROAD

Not every aspect of Roger’s life was transformed. He admitted that he continued to smoke, especially on difficult days. He still wasn’t satisfied with his level of integrity and responsibility—following through in a timely way on his commitments. Too often, Roger told us, he continued to let sudden demands divert his attention from more important but less pressing priorities. When the demands mounted high enough, he still had a tendency to get impatient and curt with others. Roger told us that he was determined to create a ritual around behaving with more grace under pressure—using such situations not as an excuse for bad behavior but as a challenge to demonstrate leadership.

罗杰生活并非在每个方面都完成了积极的转变。他承认自己还在抽烟，尤其会在特别艰难的时期。他仍然觉得自己在按时履行承诺时正直和责任心不够。他的注意力还是经常被突发事件吸引，被迫搁置那些更为重要但不太紧急的事务。当事情越积越多，他还是有可能急躁草率地对待他人。为了在压力下表现更从容，他决定建立一个新仪式习惯，承担不良行为的责任，更好地展现出领导力。

The other continuing struggle for Roger was maintaining his rituals when he traveled. As rigorous as he had become about them at home, he had yet to create comparable ones on the road. He rarely built in time to work out. He packed his schedule so tightly that he found it very difficult to take breaks. He was also less careful about his eating, skipping meals during the day and grabbing anything he could find between meetings. At dinner with clients, he still sometimes ate and drank too much.

另一个困扰罗杰的问题是如何在出差过程中同样保持这些新习惯。在家的时候他已经做得很好，但他还没有为出差的情况制订相应的计划。出差时他很少健身，日程安排得满满当当，很难找到时间休息。因为在外地，所以他对饮食也不太上心，总是不吃正餐，然后在会议中途休息时有什么吃什么。如果要与客户共进晚餐，他还是很容易暴饮暴食。

We helped Roger to design one important new ritual and to extend several of his existing ones to his time on the road. The new ritual was aimed at helping him to deal better with high pressure—and to communicate more positive energy. We asked Roger to describe how he actually experienced pressure. What he felt first, he told us, was a rising anxiety in his chest, a flood of critical thoughts and a strong desire to seize control of the situation. When he found himself in those situations, we suggested that Roger begin by taking several deep abdominal breaths. We also asked him to think for a moment about someone whose method of handling tough situations he admired. He chose his boss. Finally, we asked him to visualize behaving the way that he imagined his boss would in crisis—and to use that as a model.

我们帮助罗杰建立了一项新仪式习惯，以便更好应对高压、获取更多正面精力。我们先请罗杰描述出他是如何感受到压力的。他说心中首先升起一股焦虑，然后出现一堆批判的想法，以及想要控制局面的强烈欲望。我们建议，如果他下次处于这样的情况，就进行几次腹部深呼吸。我们还请他回想一下自己钦佩的某个人的危机处理方式，他选择了他的老板。最后，我们让他将老板当作榜样，参考他的方式处理问题。

As for traveling, Roger realized that it was simply a matter of turning his attention to building rituals comparable to those he had at home. When it came to eating better, he decided that the most important ritual was to begin carrying healthy snacks with him so that he wouldn’t be tempted to grab junk food on the run. The best time to work out on the road, he concluded, was before client dinners, which was also a way to decompress after a long day. Roger began scheduling his workout time the same way that he would any other meetings and not letting anything interfere. He also made sure that he was booked only in hotels with fitness centers. Finally, Roger committed to having no more than one glass of wine during dinners with clients and to sip at it very slowly.

至于出差的问题，罗杰意识到他仅仅需要将在家养成的习惯延续下去。关于饮食，他认为随身携带健康零食很重要，这样就不用在路边买快餐了。最好的健身时间是晚餐开始之前，还能缓解一天积蓄的压力。罗杰开始像安排重要会议那样安排自己的健身时间，决不让任何事情干扰。他还留心每次都预订带有健身房的酒店房间。最后罗杰决定，即使跟客户吃饭，红酒也不会超过一杯，而且要慢慢啜饮。

There were times during the next several months, Roger reported, when a client ordered a particularly great bottle of wine, and the seductions were too great to resist. The same was true when it came to eating at a great restaurant. He also occasionally missed workouts when his schedule got too crowded. For the most part, however, Roger was successful at instituting his new travel rituals, even as he took some ribbing for fishing protein bars out of his briefcase in the middle of long meetings. After nine months, he reported that he had dropped an additional seven pounds.

罗杰承认，有一回客户点了一瓶好酒，他没抵住诱惑，多喝了两杯。同样让他破例的还有一家很棒的餐厅。如果日程太忙碌，他偶尔也会忘记锻炼。不过，大部分时间罗杰还是尽力适应新的出差习惯，即便有次会议上他掏出能量棒时被别人开玩笑。 9个月后，罗杰的体重又减了7磅。

No change proved more challenging for Roger—nor ultimately more satisfying—than learning to respond more gracefully under pressure. When he took the time to step back and walk himself through the ritual we had devised with him, Roger found that he was able to significantly reduce his reactivity. There were still occasions when the feeling of pressure to take action overwhelmed his capacity to be more reflective. With that in mind, he eventually created a second ritual for what he called “emergencies.” In those situations, his tactic was simply to quietly nod his head in acknowledgment, regardless of what he was feeling, and then to say something like “I understand, and I’d like to take a little time to digest this before I respond.” His primary commitment was not to react when he was feeling agitated or impatient. The effect on his direct reports, he told us, was heartening. The gentler and more encouraging he became, the more they responded. In the six months after his follow-up visit with us, his team’s overall revenues increased by more than 15 percent—a period during which his company’s overall performance was flat.

在罗杰看来，从容应对压力是最令他满足也最有挑战性的改变。当他回想起我们的建议，激动程度一下就降低了。但是压力偶尔还是会控制他的行为，因此他建立了第二项仪式习惯来应对“紧急情况”。不管当时心情如何，他都会安静地点点头，说“我了解了，不过我需要一点时间想一下”。他的首要任务是不在激怒或急躁的情况下做出回应。结果令人振奋：他态度越温和，言语越鼓励他人，下属们的反馈越多。在回访6个月后，他的团队营业额增长了15%——在整个公司业绩平平的情况下，这真是了不起的成就。

Twelve months after we first saw Roger, his career back on a fast track, he made another significant change in his schedule. One day a week, with permission from his boss, he began working at home. He felt convinced that he could use the time to escape the daily demands and to focus more attention on longer-range projects and issues that required more concentrated focus. At the same time, he was eager to be more involved with his children’s daily lives. On the day that he worked at home, he took both of his children to school, picked them up in the afternoon and committed to stopping work by 5:00 P.M. The deepened connection with his girls was deeply satisfying, and he also found that the day at home was highly productive.

一年以后，罗杰的事业迅速重回正轨。他在日程里加入了一项重大改变。老板批准他可以每周一天在家办公。他坚信可以利用这段时间避开日常琐事，将精力集中在需要更多专注力的长期项目上，同时也能更积极地参与孩子们的生活。这天他会接送两个女儿上学、放学，承诺下午5点结束工作。与女儿们更紧密的沟通让他感到满足，这天的工作效率也很高。

Skeptical and resistant as he was when he first came to see us, Roger was able to identify values and to create a vision that proved to be deeply compelling to him. They became both a high-octane fuel and a reliable touchstone when he was faced with difficult choices. His rituals were the means by which he lived out his vision, both at work and at home. “What amazes me most,” Roger told us, “is that once my values became clear and I got the hang of building rituals, most of the changes I made weren’t that hard. My life acquired a certain rhythm. I can feel how much my energy has rubbed off on the people in my life. My challenge now is just to feel the pulse and keep the beat.”

虽然第一次见到我们时，罗杰表现出怀疑和抗拒，但他最终树立了自己的价值观，构建了构想蓝图，并且受益匪浅。面对困难抉择时，它们既是动力的源泉又是可靠的试金石。他通过培养一系列习惯将构想蓝图变为现实，工作和家庭两全其美。“最让我惊讶的是，”罗杰告诉我们，“一旦价值观清晰起来，而我又懂得仪式习惯的重要性，大多数改变做起来也不那么困难了。我的生活有了特定的节奏，能深切感受到自己的精力带给他人的影响。现在我的挑战仅仅是感受到生命的脉动，并保持生活的活力。”
