# The Disengaged Life of Roger B.

When he came to work with us at our training facility in Orlando, Florida, Roger B. seemed to be living a quintessentially successful life. At forty-two, he was a sales manager for a large software company. He had a six-figure salary, responsibility over four western states, and eighteen months earlier he had been named a vice president, his fourth promotion in less than six years. He met his wife Rachel, thirty-nine, in college, and they began dating in their mid-twenties. Married for fifteen years, they had two children—nine-year-old Alyssa and seven-year-old Isabel—and Rachel had her own busy career as a school psychologist. They lived in a suburb of Phoenix, on a cul-de-sac with a half dozen other young families, in a house that they had helped to design themselves. Between their demanding careers and the challenge of raising two kids who had busy schedules of their own, life was very full. But it was also a life that they had worked hard to achieve. At first blush, it was difficult to see much of a problem.

罗杰在佛罗里达州奥兰多市的教学基地与我们见面时，已经是一位典型的成功人士了。他42岁，风华正茂，是一家大型软件公司的销售经理，拥有6位数的薪水，主管西部4个州的业务，用不到6年的时间实现了4次升迁， 1年半前刚被提拔为副总经理。他和39岁的妻子瑞秋相识于大学校园，在20多岁时确定恋爱关系。结婚15年，育有二女，艾莉莎9岁，伊莎贝尔7岁。瑞秋是一所学校的心理咨询师，工作繁忙。他们住在凤凰城郊区，与另外6个年轻的家庭是同一条巷的邻居，拥有一栋亲手设计的房子，双双奔波于繁忙的工作，还要为孩子安排充实的日程，生活可谓满满当当。但所有这些也是他们辛勤劳动的成果。不论寻求任何人的意见，都会说他们的生活充实又美满。

Nonetheless, when Roger came to see us, we knew that his boss was increasingly unhappy with his performance at work. “We considered Roger a rising star for many years,” his boss had told us. “I really don’t know what happened. Two years ago, we gave him a big promotion into an important leadership position, and since then he’s gone from an A-level performer to a C plus at best. It’s affecting his whole sales force. I’m disappointed and frustrated. I haven’t completely given up hope, but if something doesn’t change soon, he’s not going to make it. Nothing would make me happier than if you could help him get back on track. He’s a good man with a lot of talent. I would hate to have to let him go.”

尽管如此，罗杰需要我们的原因则是老板对他的工作表现越来越不满意。“多年来我们一直把罗杰当作希望之星，”他的老板告诉我们，“我真的不知道发生了什么。两年前，我们破格提拔他担任领导角色，从那往后他的表现就从A级直线下降，现在最多只能打C+，还影响到了整个销售团队。我很失望，也很沮丧。虽然现在对他还没有完全失去信心，但如果仍旧没有改善，他的事业也到此为止了。如果你们能帮助他重回正轨，我会非常高兴。他是个才华横溢的好人，我也不想失去他。”

A critical part of our process involves taking a closer look at what is going on beneath the surface of our clients’ lives. Facing the Truth begins with our Full Engagement Inventory—a highly detailed questionnaire designed to surface people’s behavioral patterns and to measure how effectively they are spending and recovering energy in all dimensions of their lives. In addition, Roger filled out a brief medical history and a comprehensive nutritional profile, detailing precisely what he had eaten on three designated days. When he got to our facility, we put him through a number of physical tests, which included assessing his cardiovascular capacity, strength, flexibility, body fat percentage and blood chemistry markers such as his cholesterol level. Obviously it isn’t possible to get the same physical data by reading this book, but if you aren’t doing the sort of regular cardiovascular and strength training recommended in chapter 3, you are almost certainly progressively losing energy capacity.

我们的工作很重要的一环是透过表面看清客户的生活中实质发生了什么。面对现实的第一步是“全情投入问卷”，我们通过一系列精心设计的问题构筑客户的行为模式，量化各方面精力的消耗及恢复情况。除此之外，罗杰还提交了一份简明用药史和完整的营养表，详尽记录了指定3天内的饮食情况。等他到达基地，我们安排他进行了数项体能测试，指标包括心血管容量、力量、灵活性、体脂比例以及血液生化指数，比如胆固醇水平。显然，通过阅读本书并不能获得相应的体征数据，但若读者不按照第三章推荐的方式进行心血管训练和力量训练，必定会逐步失去精力。

Roger’s data indicated five primary performance barriers: low energy, impatience, negativity, lack of depth in relationships, and lack of passion. While he found it disturbing to receive this feedback from colleagues, his self-assessment was only slightly more positive. All performance barriers, we have found, are attributable to poor energy management—either in the form of insufficient energy renewal, insufficient energy capacity or, more typically, both. In addition, any given performance barrier is almost always influenced by multidimensional factors.

罗杰的数据显示出5项表现障碍：精力低下，焦躁，消极，人际关系淡薄，还有缺乏激情。尽管收到如此评价让罗杰很是困惑，但他的自我评估也只比同事评估高出一点点。我们发现这些表现障碍都归因于低效的精力管理，他的各项精力不是补充不足就是储备不足，有时候也二者兼具。此外，几乎所有表现障碍都受到多重因素的影响。

## PHYSICAL IS FUNDAMENTAL

In Roger’s case, the most obvious contributing factor in all of his performance barriers was the way that he managed his physical energy. All through high school and college, he had been an athlete. He played basketball and tennis and prided himself on being in excellent shape. On his medical form, he rated himself as five to ten pounds over-weight, but in answer to another question, he acknowledged that he had gained twenty-three pounds since graduating from high school. His body fat percentage was 27—average for the male clients that we see, but more than 25 percent over the acceptable limit for a man his age. His belly now peeked out over his belt, a sign of middle age that he had always sworn would never happen to him.

罗杰所有的表现障碍中，最明显的共因是他的体能管理方式。从高中到大学，他一直是校运动员。篮球网球样样过人，还练就一副引以为傲的好身材。在药用表上，他对自己的评价是“超重5～10磅”。但在问卷中，他承认高中毕业后体重增长了23磅。他的体脂比例是27，是我们客户的平均水平，但却超出该年龄段体脂上限25%。他的肚腩已经越过了皮带扣。他从没想过自己也会经历典型的中年发福。

At his latest checkup, Roger’s blood pressure had been measured at 150 over 90, just on the cusp of hypertensive. He acknowledged that his physician had urged him to make some changes in his diet, and to get more exercise. His total cholesterol level was 235—significantly above the ideal level. Roger had quit smoking a decade earlier, although he confessed that he still had an occasional cigarette when he felt especially stressed. “I don’t consider that smoking,” he said, “and I don’t want to talk about it.”

罗杰最近一次血压测量结果是150/90，正好处于高血压临界点。他承认医生催促他调整饮食结构，多锻炼身体。他的总胆固醇量为235，远远高出理想水平。他10年前就戒了烟，也坦白偶尔压力特别大的时候还是会抽一支来解闷。“我不认为那算抽烟，”他说，“我也不想再讨论这件事了。”

Roger’s eating habits went a long way toward explaining his weight gain and his problems with low energy. Most days, he skipped breakfast altogether (“I’m always trying to lose weight”), but he frequently broke down at midmorning and ordered a blueberry muffin with his second cup of coffee. When he was in the office, he usually consumed lunch at his desk, and while he tried hard to limit himself to a sandwich and a salad, he frequently also had a large bowl of frozen yogurt for dessert. When he was traveling, he often just grabbed a hamburger and fries for lunch, or a couple of slices of pizza on the run.

罗杰的饮食习惯已经充分解释了他增重以及精力低下的问题。大多时间他总是不吃早餐（“我在减肥”），然后在10点左右变得饥肠辘辘，只好去餐厅点一份蓝莓松饼，并为自己续上第二杯咖啡。在办公室工作的时候，他总是在办公桌前解决午餐，虽然他努力把食物控制在一个三明治和一份沙拉的范围，但还是会拿一大碗酸奶冰淇淋当甜点。在外出差时，他总是用汉堡和薯条或外带披萨作为午餐。

Around 4:00 P.M. on most days, his energy flagging badly, Roger often treated himself to a handful of cookies, which always seemed to be around the office. Over the course of a day his energy spiked and crashed, depending on how long he had gone without eating and what sort of sugary snacks he ate. The energy crashes strongly influenced both his level of irritability and his capacity for focus. Dinner was Roger’s biggest meal and the primary factor in his weight gain. By the time that he sat down at 7:30 or 8:00 P.M., he was usually famished and ready for something substantial—a big bowl of pasta or a generous portion of chicken or steak, potatoes, a well-dressed salad and lots of bread. About half the time he managed to resist eating another sugary snack before bed.

大约下午4点钟，罗杰的精力降了半旗，他会奖励自己一把曲奇饼干——办公室常备零食。一天中，他的精力水平会急速上升然后断片，取决于他多久没有吃东西，以及补充的是哪种糖类零食。精力断层会强烈影响他的急躁程度和专注时间。晚餐是罗杰最丰富的一餐，也是导致他超重的罪魁祸首。等到7点半或8点的晚饭时间，他早已饥肠辘辘，准备好好安慰自己的肠胃——一大碗意大利面，或是大份的鸡肉或牛排，土豆，酱汁充足的沙拉，外加大量面包。只有一半的时间，他能抵制住晚间甜食的诱惑。

Roger nearly always managed to resist exercise, which would have offset some of the effects of overeating and also provided a powerful way to detoxify negative emotions and to renew mentally. His explanation was that he simply couldn’t find the time or the energy to work out. He was on the road most mornings at 6:30. By the time he got home in the evenings, beat from an hour-and-fifteen-minute commute, the last thing he wanted to do was take a jog, or jump on the stationary bike in his basement. Instead it sat unused alongside other earlier inspirations—a rowing machine, a Nordic track and a hulking pile of free weights.

罗杰几乎总是能抗拒运动，而运动本可以抵消暴饮暴食的部分后果，还能有效缓解负面情感，让思维恢复清醒。他的解释是没有时间，没有精力。早上6点半就要出门上班，晚上花1小时15分钟才能到家，最不愿做的就是出去慢跑，或者蹬一蹬地下室的自行车。因此自行车至今仍旧停在角落一动不动。同样遭受冷遇的还有罗杰早期购置的装备——一架划艇机，一架跑步机，还有各式杠铃。

The previous Christmas, Rachel had bought Roger a membership in the health club near his office and several sessions with a personal trainer. The first week he went three times and started to feel that he was on a roll. The second week he got there only once. Within a month, he had quit going altogether. During the warm weather, Roger played golf on most Saturdays, and while he wouldn’t have minded walking the course, his partners preferred riding in the cart. He tried to get out for a brisk walk on Sunday mornings, but family obligations often got in the way. The result had been a progressive drop in his endurance over the years. At this stage in Roger’s life, climbing two flights of stairs when the elevator in his office was out of order left him feeling winded—and embarrassed.

去年圣诞节，瑞秋送给罗杰一张他办公室附近的健身俱乐部的会员卡，附带私人教练课程。第一周他去了3次，感觉良好，第二周只去了一次。一个月过去，他就再也没到访过那家健身俱乐部。天气暖和的时候，周六他会去打高尔夫。虽然他不介意全程步行，但他的搭档更愿意乘小车。周日早晨他很想出去快步走，又被家庭琐事绊住脚步。这些情况导致他的耐力逐年下降。有次办公室电梯坏了，仅仅爬两层楼就让他气喘吁吁，以他现在的年龄来看，着实令人尴尬。

To unwind from the stresses of the day, Roger typically had a martini when he got home at night and a glass or two of wine with dinner, which only made him more tired. Even so, he found it hard to get himself to bed at a reasonable hour, and when he finally turned out the light around 12:30 or 1:00 A.M., after taking one last check of his email, he often slept fitfully, and at most for five to six hours. At least once or twice a week, the struggle to fall asleep reached the point that he took a sleeping pill.

为了释放工作的压力，罗杰晚上回家通常要喝一杯马提尼，外加晚餐时的一两杯红酒，这反而让他更添疲惫。即便如此，他也很难按时上床睡觉。当他查完最后一遍邮件，关灯睡觉，已经是12点半或凌晨1点了。最多5～6个小时的睡眠也总是时梦时醒。每周至少有一两晚，他需要安眠药才能入睡。

On the nights he entertained clients, Roger acknowledged that he often had more to drink. Dinners started and ended later, and the wine usually flowed freely. Between a cocktail reception and a long dinner, it wasn’t uncommon to consume three or four glasses of wine in the course of an evening. Not only did that add several hundred empty calories to his diet, it also frequently left him feeling groggy the next morning.

罗杰承认，招待客户时他喝得更多。与客户的晚餐开始得更晚，结束也更晚，饮酒如饮水。餐前鸡尾酒加上正餐，三四杯红酒下肚很常见。这不仅给他的营养表平添几千卡路里，还让他一早醒来时眩晕无力。

Without caffeine, Roger would have had a hard time getting through his days. He tried to limit himself to two cups of coffee in the morning—three on a day when he really felt exhausted. He had twice tried to quit coffee, but when he did, he got terrible headaches. By keeping a nutritional log before coming to visit us, Roger also discovered that he was adding to his caffeine intake by consuming two or three diet colas each afternoon. Cumulatively, Roger’s choices took a severe toll not only on the quantity and quality of energy available to him, but also on his focus and his motivation.

如果没有咖啡因帮忙，罗杰很难撑下来一整天。他试图把上午的咖啡限制在两杯以内——特别疲倦的话会有三杯。他也曾两度试图戒掉咖啡，但结果头痛的状况又加重了。找到我们之前，罗杰一直记录着自己的营养摄入情况。每天下午的两到三瓶健怡可乐更增加了咖啡因摄入。长此以往，不仅罗杰的精力储备和质量受到了威胁，连专注力和进取心都岌岌可危了。

## RUNNING ON EMPTY

At the emotional level, Roger’s primary performance barriers were impatience and negativity. He found this sobering. Just as he had grown up thinking of himself as an athlete, so Roger had always considered himself easygoing. In high school, and in his fraternity at college, he was known as friendly and funny, the guy you could always count on for a good time. At the office in his early years, he was the person who made everyone in the office laugh. Over time, however, his humor had acquired an edge. Where it had once been mostly gentle and self-deprecating, now it was often sarcastic and edgy.

在情感层面，罗杰的首要表现障碍是急躁和消极。这个结论让他很是吃惊。因为他长大后特别注意维持自己的运动员形象，对外表现相当随和。不论高中还是大学，别人眼中的他都是友善风趣，可以放心交往的类型。工作早期，他也曾是办公室里的开心果。好景不长，随着工作年份的增长，幽默带上了棱角，曾经的温和自嘲变成了尖刻的讽刺。

Low energy was plainly a factor since it made Roger more vulnerable to negative emotions. At the same time, there was little about his current life that made him feel positive. During Roger’s first seven years at his company, the pressures were high, but the opportunities were great. His boss was a nurturing man who mentored him, liked his ideas, gave him lots of freedom and helped him to advance rapidly up the corporate ladder. His boss’s positive energy made Roger feel better about himself.

精力低下显然是根源之一，它让罗杰难以抵抗消极情绪的侵袭。与此同时，罗杰现在的生活也无法带给他积极向上的情绪。工作的最初7年中，罗杰的压力很大，但是机遇也不一般。他的老板善于培养员工，指导他，欣赏他的想法，给他很大空间自由发挥，提携他，让他得以平步青云。老板自身的正能量也带动了罗杰的自信心。

Now the company was experiencing a slowdown, expenses were being cut, layoffs had begun and everyone was expected to do more with less. His boss had been given broader responsibilities, Roger saw much less of him, and he couldn’t help but feel that he had fallen out of favor. It affected not just his mood, but also his passion for his work, and ultimately his performance. Energy is highly infectious, and negativity feeds on itself. Leaders have a disproportionate impact on the energy of others. Roger’s moods powerfully influenced those who worked for him, much as the feeling of being neglected by his own boss deeply affected Roger’s energy.

而现在，公司正处于低潮期，经费缩减，开始裁员，每个人承担的工作更多，收入却不相匹配。老板的负担更重了，约见罗杰的机会也少了许多，他忍不住怀疑自己是否已经失去了老板的青睐。这个念头不仅影响了罗杰的情绪，还打击了他的工作热情，最终连累了他的工作表现。精力具有极强的传染力，负面情感开始滋生蔓长，领导者对其他人的精力影响尤其明显。罗杰的情绪强烈地传递给下属，正如老板的忽视影响了他自己的精力。

Relationships are one of the most powerful potential sources of emotional renewal. For years, Roger had thought of Rachel as both his lover and his best friend. Now, with so little time together, the feeling of romance and intimacy seemed like a distant memory and sex had become much less frequent. Their relationship was increasingly transactional. Conversations focused largely on household logistics and negotiations—who was going to pick up the dry cleaning or the takeout dinner, which kid needed a ride to which after-school activity. They spent very little time talking with each other about what was really going on in their lives.

爱情本是情感疗伤的最好灵药。罗杰一直将瑞秋当作爱人和挚友。因为缺少共同相处的时间，两人间的浪漫感和亲密感已经变成遥远的记忆，连亲热的次数都少了许多。他们之间的氛围越来越公事公办，话题都围绕着家庭事务和条件协商——谁去取干洗衣物或外卖，谁送孩子去参加课外活动。现在他们极少就各自的生活交流感想。

Rachel had her own preoccupations. Her job as a psychologist covering several schools was demanding in itself. A year earlier, her father had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s at the age of seventy-seven and his deterioration was rapid. What little time Rachel previously had for herself—particularly for working out, which she craved as a way to keep her weight down and to relieve tension—was now gone. Instead, she spent much of her free time helping her mother with the increasingly demanding task of caring for her father. The pressure of her father’s illness, added to the demands of being a mother and working at a full-time job, had plainly sapped her energy reserves. It also made her even less available to Roger. He understood the stresses that Rachel was under, but couldn’t help feeling a bit abandoned, much as he did by his boss.

瑞秋也有自己的事业。作为心理咨询师，她经常要跑好几个学校，工作强度很大。一年前，她77岁的父亲被确诊为阿兹海默症，病情很快恶化。瑞秋的个人时间都被征用了——尤其是锻炼时间，她一直渴望通过锻炼保持苗条的身材，缓解紧张的神经。现在她用大量时间帮助母亲照顾越来越病重的父亲。父亲的病情无疑为作为母亲和全职工作者的她雪上加霜，也耗尽了她的精力储备。她更拿不出时间陪伴罗杰了。罗杰理解妻子承担的压力，却还是不由自主萌生出被抛弃的感觉，跟工作中的感受如出一辙。

Meanwhile, Alyssa, nine, had begun having some problems in school. After testing, it turned out that she had some modest learning disabilities. She became convinced that she was “stupid,” and it was beginning to affect her schoolwork and her social life. Roger knew that Alyssa needed attention and reassurance, but often he just couldn’t summon the energy to reach out to her in the evenings. Isabel, the seven-year-old, seemed to be doing fine, but Roger’s fatigue also affected his relationship with her. When she sought him out to play cards or Monopoly with her, he often begged off or suggested that they watch television together instead.

这时， 9岁的艾莉莎课业也出现了问题。学校测试显示她有轻微的学习障碍，她开始认定自己是“傻子”，妨碍了学业和人际交往。罗杰知道艾莉莎需要关注和安慰，但他无法拿出足够的精力帮助她。 7岁的伊莎贝尔目前看上去一切都好，但罗杰的疲倦也影响了父女交流。每当她想找爸爸陪她玩纸牌或者大富翁时，他总是好言婉拒，或者干脆提议大家一起看电视。

As for friendship, there just wasn’t much time, given all the other demands in his life. The three friends that Roger did see regularly were his golfing buddies, and while he found the time they spent together relaxing, it wasn’t especially satisfying. Competing noisily on the golf course and then smoking cigars and drinking beer in the clubhouse afterward felt more like fraternity life than real friendship. Rachel didn’t have much use for the guys and resented the time that Roger spent playing golf. He was gone for five or six hours on Saturdays, and she complained that the time would be better spent with the kids, or doing errands. Roger believed that he deserved at least one chunk of time for himself after his tiring weeks, but he worried guiltily that Rachel had a legitimate point. After all, she took no comparable time for herself. The irony was that even with the golf, his weekends at home rarely left him feeling restored or renewed.

至于友情，考虑到生活中已经有足够多需要操心的事情，看似更微不足道了。罗杰经常见面的三个朋友都是高尔夫球友，即便在一起的时间很放松，还是填补不了友情的空缺。他们在高尔夫球场闹哄哄地竞争，在俱乐部里抽雪茄喝啤酒，感觉更像兄弟会而不是真正的友谊。瑞秋不太跟这些人往来，也不喜欢罗杰在周六打高尔夫，一走就是五六个小时。她觉得这个时间用来陪伴孩子或做实事会更好。而罗杰认为，经过劳累的一周，自己至少值得一些放松和休息的时间。可他还是会感到内疚，毕竟妻子从来没有同样的休闲时间。而且讽刺的是，即使打了高尔夫，周末也很少让他有焕然一新和重装上阵的感觉。

## THE FIGHT TO FOCUS

The way that Roger managed his energy physically and emotionally helped to account for his third performance barrier: poor focus. Fatigue, unhappiness with his boss, frustration with Rachel, guilt about not spending more time with his children and the increased demands of his new job all made it difficult for him to stay focused mentally at work. Managing his time, which had never been much of an issue when he worked primarily as a salesman, was significantly more difficult now that he was expected to supervise forty people in four states. For the first time in his career, Roger found that he was distracted and inefficient.

罗杰对身体和情感的管理方式导致了第三项表现障碍：专注力差。疲倦，对老板不满，与瑞秋不合，内疚自己没有更多陪伴孩子，新职位的压力，这些因素让他很难把精力集中在工作上。当他还是普通销售员的时候，时间管理从来不是问题。而现在，他需要管理4个州共40名员工，时间突然变得捉襟见肘。步入职场以来，罗杰第一次感到自己精力分散、效率低下。

On a typical day in the office, Roger received between fifty and seventy-five emails, and at least two dozen voice mails. Because he traveled as much as half of the time, he began carrying a BlackBerry. That made it possible to pick up his email anytime, anywhere. The problem was that he found himself forever responding to other people’s issues and rarely setting his own agenda. Email also affected his attention span. He found it increasingly difficult to sustain concentration on any given task for long. Where he once thought of himself as creative and resourceful—he had designed the customer-tracking software that the whole office now used—there seemed to be no time anymore for longer-term projects. Instead, Roger lived his life from email to email, demand to demand, crisis to crisis. He rarely took breaks and his focus seemed to deteriorate as the day wore on.

在办公室的一天，罗杰通常要接收50～75封邮件，至少两打语音信息。因为他一半时间都在外面，他开始随身携带黑莓手机，让自己随时随地都能收发邮件。时间一长，他发现自己永远都在回应别人的问题，而不是执行自己的日程安排。电子邮件也会分散他的注意力，他发现长时间做某项任务变得越来越难。他曾认为自己创意十足、足智多谋，还设计了整座办公室的客户追踪软件，可他现在已经没空接手长期任务了。罗杰的工作内容变成了一封接一封的电子邮件，一个接一个的指标下达，一件接一件的危机处理。他很少休息，专注力也日渐恶化。

Like nearly everyone he knew, Roger rarely left his work at the office. On his commute home at the end of the day, he usually spent his time on the cell phone returning calls. He answered email in the evenings and on the weekends. During the family’s first European vacation the previous summer, Roger had felt compelled to check his voice mail and email every day. The prospect of returning home to a thousand unread emails and two hundred voice mails seemed worse, he told himself, than taking an hour out of each vacation day to stay current. The result was that Roger almost never disconnected completely from work.

就像他认识的所有人一样，罗杰也从不把工作只留在办公室。在回家的路上，他总是用手机回电话，晚间和周末还在回邮件。去年夏天全家第一次去欧洲度假，罗杰还是强迫症一般每天查邮件和语音信息。他对自己说，回到家发现1000封未读邮件和200条语音信息等着他显然更可怕，还不如假期内每天抽出1个小时跟进工作。所以在某种意义上，罗杰从未真正离开过办公室。

## WHAT REALLY MATTERS?

The truth was that Roger now spent so much of his life responding to external demands that he had lost touch with any sense of what he really wanted from life. When we asked what gave him the greatest sense of passion and meaning in his life, he came up empty. He didn’t feel much passion at work, he admitted, even though his authority and his stature had increased. He didn’t feel much at home, even though it was clear that he loved his wife and children and considered them his highest priorities. The powerful source of energy that can be derived from connecting to a clear sense of purpose simply wasn’t available to Roger. Unmoored from deeply held values, he didn’t have much motivation to take better care of himself physically, or to control his impatience, or even to prioritize his time and focus his attention. With so much to keep him busy, he spent very little energy reflecting on the choices that he had made. Thinking about his life only made him uncomfortable anyway, since nothing seemed likely to change.

实际情况是，罗杰花费了太多时间应付外界的问题，反而不再思考自己对于生活的期望。我们问他，生活中最能给他带来激情和满足的是什么，他却张口无言。即便自己在公司的地位和威望都在上升，他还是没有太多的工作热情。在家也是一样，虽然他的确深爱妻子和孩子们，把她们视为至宝。精力的强大源头在于目标清晰，而罗杰显然缺乏这种动力。他也未曾培养深刻的价值观，激励自己更好地照顾身体，或者控制焦躁，更好地规划时间、集中注意力。这么多事情让他手忙脚乱，他没空反思自己是否做对了每一个抉择。思考人生只会让他更加消沉，因为所有事情看起来都无法改变。

Roger had nearly everything that he once thought he wanted from life, but more often than not what he felt was tired and frustrated, overworked and underappreciated. Above all, Roger told us, he felt like a victim of factors beyond his control.

罗杰几乎拥有了他曾经渴望的一切，但他却越来越感到疲惫、沮丧，形单影只。最后，罗杰告诉我们，他觉得自己变成了无能为力的牺牲品。

> I am a good guy, a decent guy, and I’m doing the best I can for my family. Sure I’m struggling, but I’m just trying to meet my responsibilities. I’ve got house payments and car payments and I’m trying to save for college for the kids. I would love to stay in shape, but between my commute and the hours I put in at work, I just can’t find the time. It’s true I’ve put on some weight, but when you live your life on the run, it’s hard to eat healthy meals. Yeah, I eat snacks during the day, but how bad are a couple of cookies and an occasional bowl of frozen yogurt? A cigarette or two a day and a couple of drinks in the evening are just small pleasures that help take the edge off. It’s not like I’m addicted.
