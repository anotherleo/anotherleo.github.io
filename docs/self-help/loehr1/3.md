# The Pulse of High Performance: Balancing Stress and Recovery

The concept of maximizing performance by alternating periods of activity with periods of rest was first advanced by Flavius Philo-stratus (A.D. 170–245), who wrote training manuals for Greek athletes. Russian sports scientists resurrected the concept in the 1960s and began applying it with stunning success to their Olympic athletes. Today, “work-rest” ratios lie at the heart of periodization, a training method used by elite athletes throughout the world.

通过运动和休息交替进行可以最大限度提高表现，这条理论最初由斐洛斯特拉图斯提出，他是古希腊运动员训练手册的编撰者。前苏联运动科学家于20世纪60年代重启了这项概念，指导本国的奥运会选手取得了惊人的成功。如今，“训练-休息”的比例搭配仍是建立训练周期的基础理论，被全球的顶尖运动员广泛采用。

The science of periodization has become more precise and more sophisticated over the years, but the basic concept hasn’t changed since it was first advanced nearly two thousand years ago. Following a period of activity, the body must replenish fundamental biochemical sources of energy. This is called “compensation” and when it occurs, energy expended is recovered. Increase the intensity of the training or the performance demand, and it is necessary to commensurately increase the amount of energy renewal. Fail to do so and the athlete will experience a measurable deterioration in performance.

对训练周期的研究正朝着更精确复杂的方向发展，但其基础理论与2000多年前初建时并无二致。通过一定时间的活动消耗，人体需要从基础生化源获取能量。这一过程叫作“补偿”，消耗的能量通过补偿而得以恢复。随着训练强度增大、对运动员要求提高，能力的恢复和补偿程度也必然相应增加，否则，运动员的表现将会逐渐下降。

Energy is simply the capacity to do work. Our most fundamental need as human beings is to spend and recover energy.

精力简单来讲就是做事的能力。人类最基本的需求是精力的消耗与恢复。

We need energy to perform, and recovery is more than the absence of work. It serves not just health and happiness, but also performance. Nearly every elite athlete we have worked with over the years has come to us with performance problems that could be traced to an imbalance between the expenditure and the recovery of energy. They were either overtraining or undertraining in one or more dimensions—physically, emotionally, mentally or spiritually. Both overtraining and undertraining have performance consequences that include persistent injuries and sickness, anxiety, negativity and anger, difficulty concentrating, and loss of passion. We achieved our breakthroughs with athletes by helping them to more skillfully manage energy—pushing themselves to systematically increase capacity in whatever dimension it was insufficient, but also to build in regular recovery as part of their training regimens.

我们需要精力来创造最佳表现，而精力的恢复尤为重要。它不仅确保我们享有健康和幸福，还能提升我们的做事能力。几乎所有精英运动员客户来找我们时都面对着水平发挥的难题，而这些难题归根结底都是精力消耗和恢复的不平衡。他们在体能、情感、思维和意志的一个或多个层面要么过度训练，要么训练不足。二者都会直接体现在运动员的表现上，包括持续的伤病、焦虑、消极、愤怒、难以集中精力和失去激情。我们以帮助运动员更好地管理精力为突破口，系统地增强某个能力不足的层面，并在训练日程中加入定期恢复的内容。

Balancing stress and recovery is critical not just in competitive sports, but also in managing energy in all facets of our lives. When we expend energy, we draw down our reservoir. When we recover energy, we fill it back up. Too much energy expenditure without sufficient recovery eventually leads to burnout and breakdown. (Overuse it and lose it.) Too much recovery without sufficient stress leads to atrophy and weakness. (Use it or lose it.) Just think about an arm placed in a cast for an extended period of time in order to protect it from the “stress” to which it is ordinarily subjected. In a very short time, the muscles of the arm begin to atrophy from disuse. The benefits of a sustained fitness program decrease significantly after just one week of inactivity—and disappear altogether in as few as four weeks.

平衡压力和恢复不仅在竞技体育中有重要意义，也同样应用于生活中各方面的精力管理。精力消耗导致储备减少，精力恢复带动储量上升。过度消耗而恢复不足最终将导致精力衰竭崩溃，恢复超出消耗则导致萎缩和衰弱。想想一只打着石膏的手臂吧，石膏的本意是保护手臂不被过度使用，如果超过一定时间，手臂肌肉反而因为静养变得无力，甚至发生肌肉萎缩。持续健身能带来身心改善，但若停止一周，曾经的改善就会大幅退步，只要停止4周，这种改善就会完全消失。

The same process occurs emotionally, mentally and spiritually. Emotional depth and resilience depend on active engagement with others and with our own feelings. Mental acuity diminishes in the absence of ongoing intellectual challenge. Spiritual energy capacity depends on regularly revisiting our deepest values and holding ourselves accountable in our behavior. Full engagement requires cultivating a dynamic balance between the expenditure of energy (stress) and the renewal of energy (recovery) in all dimensions.

情感、思维和意志的层面里亦是如此。情感的深度和适应力取决于外界交往的积极程度和内省习惯。思维的敏锐度会因为缺乏思维挑战而减退。意志精力依赖于不断温习深层价值取向，为自我行为负责。全情投入需要在各个层面培养精力消耗（压力）和精力再生（恢复）的动态平衡。

We call this rhythmic wave oscillation, and it represents the fundamental pulse of life.

我们称之为有节奏的波动，它代表了生命的本质脉动。

The more powerful our pulse, the more fully engaged we can be. The same is true organizationally. To the degree that leaders and managers build cultures around continuous work—whether that means several-hour meetings, or long days, or the expectation that people will work in the evenings and on weekends—performance is necessarily compromised over time. Cultures that encourage people to seek intermittent renewal not only inspire greater commitment, but also more productivity.

波动越强，我们越能够做到全情投入。这一点在组织层面依旧成立。如果管理者和经理们围绕长时间持续的工作建立起企业文化——不论是一开几个小时的会议，还是鼓励下属晚上和周末加班加点，员工的工作表现必然会随着时间延长变得越来越差。鼓励人们适度休息的企业文化不仅能够提高员工的忠诚度，也会给组织带来更高的效率。

Instead, most of us tend to live far more linear lives. We assume that we can spend energy indefinitely in some dimensions—often the mental and emotional—and that we can perform effectively without investing much energy at all in others—most commonly the physical and the spiritual. We become flat liners.

与理想状态相反，多数人的生活更趋于单线化。人们往往一厢情愿地假设某些层面的精力可以无限消耗——通常是思维和情感方面，认为某些层面不需投注太多精力就能高效产出——通常是身体和精神方面。长此以往，我们的生活也就平淡无味了。

## THE PULSE OF LIFE

Nature itself has a pulse, a rhythmic, wavelike movement between activity and rest. Think about the ebb and flow of the tides, the movement between seasons, and the daily rising and setting of the sun. Likewise, all organisms follow life-sustaining rhythms—birds migrating, bears hibernating, squirrels gathering nuts, and fish spawning, all of them at predictable intervals.

自然本身存在规律的脉动，在活跃和休息之间有节奏、波浪形地交替。涨潮退潮，四季更替，日升日落，不胜枚举。同理，所有有机体都遵从恒久的节奏——鸟类迁徙，熊类冬眠，松鼠收集坚果，鱼儿产卵，生物的活动都有一定的间歇。

So, too, human beings are guided by rhythms—both those dictated by nature and those encoded in our genes. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is an illness that is attributable both to changes in seasonal rhythms and to the body’s inability to adapt. Our breathing, brain waves, body temperature, heart rates, hormone levels and blood pressure all have healthy (and unhealthy) rhythmic patterns.

因此，人类也具有内在的节奏，有些是自然所为，有些由基因决定。季节性情感障碍由季节变化和身体机能无法相应调整共同导致。我们的呼吸、脑电波、体温、心律、荷尔蒙水平和血压都有健康（或不健康）的节奏波动。

We are oscillatory beings in an oscillatory universe. Rhythmicity is our inheritance.

我们是波动世界内的波动个体。节奏性存在我们的基因中。

Oscillation occurs even at the most basic levels of our being. Healthy patterns of activity and rest lie at the heart of our capacity for full engagement, maximum performance and sustained health. Linearity, by contrast, ultimately leads to dysfunction and death. Just picture for a moment the undulating wave form of a healthy EEG or EKG—and then think about the implications of their opposite: a flat line.

波动甚至会出现在人体的基本层面上。张弛有度是全情投入、维持机能和保持健康的关键。相反，单线化运动最终会导致机能障碍和死亡。想象一幅健康的脑电图或心电图是如何起伏波动的，再想象它的反面，是不是一条直线？

At the broadest level, our activity and rest patterns are tied to circadian rhythms (circa dies, “around a day”), which cycle approximately every twenty-four hours. In the early 1950s, researchers Eugene Aserinsky and Nathan Kleitman discovered that sleep occurs in smaller cycles of 90- to 120-minute segments. We move from light sleep, when brain activity is intense and dreaming occurs, to deeper sleep, when the brain is more quiescent and the deepest restoration takes place. This rhythm is called the “basic rest-activity cycle” (BRAC). In the 1970s, further research showed that a version of the same 90-to 120-minute cycles—ultradian rhythms (ultra dies, “many times a day”)—operates in our waking lives.

广义来讲，我们的“活动-休息”模式遵从生理节奏，大约每24小时循环一次。 20世纪50年代初，研究员阿瑟林斯基和克莱特曼发现，睡眠有90～120分钟的周期，从浅层睡眠——大脑活动频繁和做梦的阶段，到深度睡眠——大脑静止并深层修复。这个过程称作“活跃-休整基础循环”（BRAC）。到了70年代，进一步的研究表明，大脑清醒状态下也存在同样的90～120分钟的周期，即次昼夜节律。

These ultradian rhythms help to account for the ebb and flow of our energy throughout the day. Physiological measures such as heart rate, hormonal levels, muscle tension and brain-wave activity all increase during the first part of the cycle—and so does alertness. After an hour or so, these measures start to decline. Somewhere between 90 and 120 minutes, the body begins to crave a period of rest and recovery. Signals include a desire to yawn and stretch, hunger pangs, increased tension, difficulty concentrating, an inclination to procrastinate or fantasize, and a higher incidence of mistakes. We are capable of overriding these natural cycles, but only by summoning the fight-or-flight response and flooding our bodies with stress hormones that are designed to help us handle emergencies.

次昼夜节律掌控一天里精力的涨退。生理指数如心跳、激素水平、肌肉张力和脑波活动在循环周期的前段都会升高；经过1个小时左右，所有数值都开始下降。大约90～120分钟之后，身体开始渴望休息和恢复，并发出一些信号，如打哈欠和伸懒腰，阵发饥饿感，压力增大，难以集中，做事拖拉，胡思乱想，容易犯错等。多数人克服自然循环的方法就是勉力斗争，让身体释放压力荷尔蒙，使自己能够应对突发事件。

The long-term cost is that toxins build up inside us. We can only push so hard for so long without breaking down and burning out. Stress hormones that circulate chronically in our bodies may be temporarily energizing, but over time they prompt symptoms such as hyperactivity, aggressiveness, impatience, irritability, anger, self-absorption and insensitivity to others. Override the need for oscillation long enough and the symptoms may extend to headaches, back pain, gastrointestinal disorders, and ultimately to heart attacks and even death.

长此以往，毒素会在体内积累。我们再逼迫自己也终有限度，时间过长或压力过大就变得精疲力竭甚至崩溃。压力荷尔蒙在体内定期循环，或许能暂时保持机体活力，但时间一长就会出现多动、咄咄逼人、急躁、烦躁、愤怒、自私自利、对他人漠不关心等症状。如果人们始终忽略张弛有度的法则，还会面临头痛、背痛、肠胃功能紊乱、心脏病甚至死亡的危险。

Because the body craves oscillation, we will often turn to artificial means to make waves when our lives become too linear. When we lack sufficient energy to meet the demands in our lives, for example, we turn to stimulants such as caffeine, cocaine and amphetamines. When we can’t relax naturally, we may begin to rely on alcohol, marijuana and sleeping pills to cool down. If you are drinking several cups of coffee to stay alert during the day and a couple of drinks or several glasses of wine to disengage in the evening, you are simply masking your own linearity.

因为身体需要张弛有度，我们常常通过人工方式制造波动，缓解生活的单线化。当精力储备不足以应对现状时，我们会投奔咖啡因、可卡因、安非他命等刺激物。如果我们无法通过自然方式得到休息，则会依赖酒精、大麻和安眠药的帮助。如果你白天需要咖啡提神，晚上需要酒精放松，那么你就是在描画自己的直线生活。

## THE TIME BETWEEN POINTS

To live like a sprinter is to break life down into a series of manageable intervals consistent with our own physiological needs and with the periodic rhythms of nature. This insight first crystallized for Jim when he was working with world-class tennis players. As a performance psychologist, his goal was to understand the factors that set apart the greatest competitors in the world from the rest of the pack. Jim spent hundreds of hours watching top players and studying tapes of their matches. To his growing frustration, he could detect almost no significant differences in their competitive habits during points. It was only when he began to notice what they did between points that he suddenly saw a difference. While most of them were not aware of it, the best players had each built almost exactly the same set of routines between points. These included the way they walked back to the baseline after a point; how they held their heads and shoulders; where they focused their eyes; the pattern of their breathing; and even the way they talked to themselves.

学习短跑运动员，就是把生活拆分成一系列可以掌控的阶段，既满足生理需求，又符合自然规律。这个想法最初是吉姆发现的，当时他正与多位世界级网球选手合作。作为效能心理学家，吉姆的目标是找到最优秀的竞技选手与普通选手的差别。他花了数百小时观看顶级选手的比赛，研究场地录像，结果却令他大失所望。这些选手比赛当中的技能习惯并无大异。当他把目光转向选手们的得分之后的行为，终于豁然开朗。虽然大部分人都不自知，但最佳选手们在两轮比赛期间有固定的行为模式，包括得分后走回基线时头和肩膀如何摆正，视线看向哪里，呼吸模式，甚至自言自语的习惯等。

It dawned on Jim that these players were instinctively using the time between points to maximize their recovery. Many lower-ranked competitors, he began to see, had no recovery routines at all. When he hooked up the top players to EKG telemetry, which allowed him to monitor their heart rates, he made another startling discovery. In the sixteen to twenty seconds between points in a match, the heart rates of top competitors dropped as much as twenty beats per minute. By building highly efficient and focused recovery routines, these players had found a way to derive extraordinary energy renewal in a very short period of time. Because lesser competitors had no comparable routines between points, their heart rates often remained at high levels throughout their matches regardless of their level of fitness. The best competitors were using rituals to recover more efficiently and to better prepare for each upcoming point.

吉姆恍然大悟，这些选手利用比赛的间隙力争最大限度恢复体力，而许多排名靠后的选手根本没有恢复体力的习惯。在监测顶级选手的心率时，他又有了其他发现。得分之后间的16～20秒内，顶级选手的心跳竟然能够降至每分钟20次。通过建立高效的体力恢复机制，这些运动员能够在极短的时间内完成精力再造。普通选手没有相应的赛间习惯，在整场比赛中心率都停留在较高的水平，因此身体很难支撑下来；而顶尖选手会利用细小的习惯更有效地恢复体力，为赢得下一分做好准备。

The performance consequences of instituting precise between-point rituals were dramatic. Imagine two players of relatively equal talent and fitness in the third hour of a match. One has been regularly recovering between points, while the other has not. Clearly, the second player will be far more physically fatigued. In turn, fatigue has a cascade effect. A tired player is more susceptible to negative emotions such as anger and frustration, which will likely push his heart rate still higher, and likely lead to muscular tension. Physical fatigue also makes it far more difficult to concentrate. The same phenomenon applies even for those of us who work in sedentary jobs. Imagine that you have been sitting for long and continuous hours at your desk, operating under very high pressure. Fatigue is a likely consequence, and so is susceptibility to negative emotions and to distraction, all of which ultimately undermine performance.

得分间隙休息的影响是惊人的。我们设想一下，技术水平和身体条件势均力敌的两位选手进入一场比赛的第三个小时，其中一位始终利用得分间隙休息调整，另一位则没有。显然后者的身体更感劳累，而劳累又会带来其他负面情感，如愤怒和沮丧，使得他的心率进一步升高，肌肉僵硬。身体劳累也会让人难以集中注意力。普通人在高压之下连续伏案工作几个小时，劳累是必然的结果，随之而来的还有负面情感，注意力分散，这些最终都将降低你的表现。

In tennis, Jim’s research proved this in measurable ways. The more linear or unvarying players’ heart rates became, the worse they tended to play and the more likely it was that they lost their matches. Too much energy expenditure without sufficient recovery caused their heart rates to become chronically elevated. Their performance was equally compromised when their heart rates remained chronically low—typically a sign that they were not committed enough or had given up the fight.

在网球运动，吉姆证实了这个结论。选手的心跳越是一成不变，他们的表现越会逐渐变差，更有可能输掉比赛，因为精力消耗却得不到补充会导致心跳逐渐加快。同样，心跳迟缓的选手也发挥不出应有水平，因为他们不够投入，或者已经放弃了比赛。

Even in a sport such as golf, which requires very little expenditure of physical energy, rituals that balance energy expenditure with recovery are critical. Jack Nicklaus was remarkable for his skill and consistency, but also for his remarkable ability to analyze the elements that contributed to his success:

甚至像高尔夫这样体能消耗很少的运动，保持精力消耗和再生的平衡也十分重要。尼克劳斯的技能和表现一直为人称道，他对自己成功秘诀的总结也很中肯：

> I was blessed with the ability to focus intensely on whatever I’m doing through most distraction and usually to the exclusion of whatever else might otherwise preoccupy me. Nevertheless, I can’t concentrate on nothing but golf shots for the time it takes to play 18 holes. Even if I could, I suspect the drain of mental energy would make me pretty fuzzy-headed long before the last putt went down. In consequence, I’ve developed a regimen that allows me to move from peaks of concentration into valleys of relaxation and back again as necessary.
>
> 我拥有在任何情况下高度集中的能力，摒弃那些让我分心的事物。然而，我无法在打完18洞的过程里始终集中精力，即便可以，我怀疑我的思维也会过度损耗，思维变得混沌，最终还是无法推杆入洞。因而我制订了一套步骤，帮助我完成从高度集中到惬意放松的过渡，反之亦然。
>
> My focus begins to sharpen as I walk onto the tee, then steadily intensifies as I complete the process of analysis and evaluation that produces a clear-cut strategy for every shot I play. It then peaks as I set up to the ball and execute the swing when, ideally, my mind picture of what I’m trying to do is both totally exclusionary and totally positive.
>
> 在我走向球座时，意识开始变得敏锐，在我分析场地、思考策略的过程中继续集中，在我立好球、挥杆时达到顶峰。那时我的思维完全不被外界干扰，只有脑海中规划的清晰路线。
>
> Unless the tee shot finds serious trouble, when I might immediately start processing possible recoveries, I descend into a valley as I leave the tee, either through casual conversation with a fellow competitor or by letting my mind dwell on whatever happens into it. I try to adhere to this pattern whether I’m playing my best or worst, but obviously have to work harder at it when things aren’t going well.
>
> 除非开球失误，需要我立刻寻找补救办法，否则从离开球座起我就退入了惬意的山谷，要么跟其他选手随意聊天，要么放任我的思想天马行空。不管有没有发挥出最好的水平，我一直坚持这个模式，不过，事情不顺时当然应该更加努力一点。

Balancing stress and recovery is valuable in any performance venue. In 1998, for example, the United States Army undertook a study to assess productivity during warfare. The measure was how many shells a gunnery crew could land on a target during a three-day period. One crew was told to shoot as many shells as it could manage over the entire three days. The second crew was told to take intermittent naps. For the first day, the nonstop shooters landed more shells on the target than their colleagues. By the second day, the accuracy of the nonstop shooters progressively waned and the intermittent nappers gained the lead for good.

压力和恢复的平衡在任何效能至上的领域中都意义非凡。 1998年，美国陆军进行了一项作战效率的研究，衡量一组炮手能够在三天里击中目标多少次。第一组被要求在3天里尽可能发射炮弹，第二组人被要求不时停下休息。第一天，不休息的小队击中目标的次数更多；第二天，不休息的炮手准确度急剧下降，经过休息的炮手们反超得分，并一直领先到最后。

Periods of recovery are likewise intrinsic to creativity and to intimate connection. Sounds become music in the spaces between notes, just as words are created by the spaces between letters. It is in the spaces between work that love, friendship, depth and dimension are nurtured. Without time for recovery, our lives become a blur of doing unbalanced by much opportunity for being.

恢复周期对创造力和亲密关系都同等重要。声音通过音符间的停顿空白组成了音乐，如同字母和空白组成了单词。就在工作的空白时段，爱、友谊、深度和维度得以延伸。如果没有恢复的时间，我们的生活将在失衡中变得一片混乱。

## RECOVERY AT WORK

Several years ago, the magazine Fast Company asked a series of successful professionals to talk about how they avoided burnout in the face of highly demanding jobs. Nearly every one described very specific routines that they had instituted to insure they regularly renewed themselves. Maggie Wilderotter, the president of Wink Communications, which develops interactive forms of television, developed something that she called a “lion hunt.” “I prowl through the office, asking people what they’re working on,” she explained. “This gives me a chance to connect with employees whom I don’t usually talk to. Lion hunts are incredibly relaxing because—even if they last just thirty minutes—they take me away from a schedule that requires me to push, push, push. I’ve never burned out because I don’t let myself get to that point. You’ve got to be able to pace yourself and allow time for plenty of breaks. . . . Time is a finite resource and we all place infinite demands on it. I view time as an opportunity, as a chance to make choices about how I spend that resource.”

几年前，《快公司》杂志采访过数位成功人士，询问他们如何避免高强度压力下工作的过度劳累，几乎所有人都提到了定期更新精力的方法。发明了交互式电视的温克传播公司董事长维尔德罗特发明了一套自称为“猎狮”的活动。“我‘潜伏’在办公室里，问大家手头上都在忙些什么，与平日不太交流的员工增进感情。‘猎狮’能让我放松下来，哪怕仅仅30分钟，也能让我从迫在眉睫的日程中短暂离开。我从来不会过度劳累，因为我不会让自己工作到那种程度。你必须要控制好自己的节奏，留出时间休息……时间是一种有限的资源，我们也应该有限度地索取。我将时间当作机遇，一个决定资源分配的机会。”

Carisa Bianchi, president and CEO of the advertising company TBWA/Chiat/Day in San Francisco, builds recovery into her frequent travel. “I never work on airplanes—no computer, no phone, nothing,” she said. “I read books and magazines and I listen to music—things that I don’t usually have the time to do. You can always find reasons to work. There will always be one more thing to do, but when people don’t take time out, they stop being productive.” For Joe Gibbs, a former pro football coach who now runs a race-car company, recovery rituals focus around vacations. “On my calendar, I mark the days on which I tend to get away with my family,” he explained. “They’re marked with big yellow X’s. We take a four-day weekend each month. Around Christmastime we spend nine days either skiing or vacationing someplace warm.”

李岱艾广告公司旧金山分公司首席执行官比安奇将精力恢复的过程融入了频繁的出差时间。“我从来不在飞机上工作，不碰手机，不碰电脑，不办公，只是阅读书籍报刊，听听音乐，做那些我通常没有时间做的事。要想工作总有理由，因为事情来得总比你的处理速度快。但如果不腾出时间休息，你就会失去效率。”前专业足球教练吉伯斯现在经营一家赛车公司，他的休息秘诀则是假期。“我会把跟家人度假的日子在日历上用荧光笔圈起来。我们每月有一次四天的周末。圣诞节假期有九天，我们要么去滑雪，要么去温暖的地方度假。”

Bill Norman, executive vice president of the furniture company Herman Miller, described how he meticulously manages his schedule to maximize productivity on the job by minimizing distractions and building in plenty of time for energy renewal. “I stopped using voice mail six or seven years ago and I don’t use a cell phone at all,” he explained. “I know people for whom work is their life, their sole interest. But I think it’s very important to do things outside of work that you enjoy. I enjoy photographing landscapes and taking close-up nature shots. It refreshes me and helps me stay focused. Photography exercises a set of creative muscles in my brain that don’t necessarily get worked out in business—the ones that develop your intuitive mind, which can be critical for on-the-job decision making.”

赫曼米勒家具公司的副总裁诺曼描述了他如何悉心规划日程，将分心事物降到最低，留出足够的休整时间，以便最大化工作产出。“我从六七年前就停止了使用语音信息，现在也不用手机。我见过视工作为生命的人，把工作当作唯一的爱好。但我认为工作之余做一些自己喜欢的事也非常重要。我喜欢外出采风，走进自然，自然让我重新振作，变得更加专注。摄影练习需要不断调动大脑的创造力，有时工作都未必有相应的效果。它能培养直觉思维，在工作决策时会特别有帮助。”

## RENEWING ORGANIZATIONAL ENERGY

Balancing stress and recovery can be especially powerful on an organizational level. Bruce F. runs a division of a large telecommunications company and he came through our program with members of his top team. Along the way, it emerged that he liked to hold meetings that ran as long as three to four hours without a break. Immensely energetic himself, Bruce acknowledged that there was a macho element to these marathons, but he also told us that he considered the ability to sustain concentration over long periods a key measure of a strong executive. We pointed out that if his goal was to maximize productivity, he simply wasn’t managing his team’s energy efficiently. Given his demands, his executives might well force themselves to hang in at long meetings, and some would obviously do so more effectively than others. None of them, however, could possibly be as focused and sharp at the end of four nonstop hours as they had been at the start of the meeting.

平衡压力和恢复精力在组织层面有着强大的力量。布鲁斯经营着一家大型电视集团的分部，他带着公司高层管理者们来到我们的培训基地。在调研过程中，我们发现他习惯连续开会三四个小时，中间没有休息。布鲁斯是一个精力充沛的人，认为这种马拉松式的风格能激起人们的勇气，他也认为，长时间集中注意力是高管的考核指标之一。我们向他指出，如果他的目标是团队产出最大化，那么他并没有做到高效地管理团队精力。由于老板作风如此，高管们也只有强迫自己适应冗长的会议，有些做到了，有些没做到，然而，没有人能在连续四个小时之后还能保持会议初始的敏锐和专注。

At first Bruce was skeptical about the whole notion of recovery. He was moved, however, by the story of Jim’s between-point research and most especially by the quality of recovery that players were able to get in a very short period of time. When Bruce left us, he decided to experiment with building brief periods of recovery into his own workdays. Almost immediately, he discovered that he not only returned from his breaks more physically energized, but also that he felt more positive emotionally. An enthusiastic man by nature, Bruce became a true believer in the power of intermittent recovery. He continued to experiment with different forms, and eventually settled on two that took his mind completely off work and proved to be especially restorative.

起初布鲁斯并不相信精力再生的说法，但是他被吉姆的得分间隙研究打动了，尤其是运动员在极短时间内体力大幅回升的可行性打动了他。离开咨询室，布鲁斯决定亲身体验一下，在工作日程中加入休息时间。他几乎立刻就发现，休息过后不仅体力更加充沛，情绪也变得积极向上。布鲁斯立刻成为了间歇休息的忠实执行者，不断尝试新的休息方式，最终找到了两种能让他完全从工作中抽离、最大限度恢复体力的方式。

Bruce’s first recovery strategy was walking up and down a dozen flights of stairs in his office building. The second was juggling. Shortly after leaving us, he began teaching himself to juggle using three balls. Within six months, he could handle a half-dozen, and the experience took his mind completely off work and gave him a pure sense of joy. Several weeks after his visit to us, Bruce completely changed the way that he conducted meetings. He began scheduling an inviolable fifteen-minute break every ninety minutes—and he requested that no one discuss business during the breaks. “People took a cue from me,” Bruce said. “Our recovery breaks just loosened up our whole organization. We get more done at our meetings now in less time, and we have more fun doing it.”

第一个是在他的办公楼里爬楼梯，上上下下十几层。第二个是空中抛物杂耍。最初他自学抛3个物体，练习6个月后就能够抛接6个物体。这项活动让他的心思完全摆脱了工作，在技能进步中感受单纯的喜悦。咨询结束几周后，他就完全改变了以往的开会方式，雷打不动地每90分钟组织15分钟的休息，并要求大家在休息期间不要谈论工作。“人们嗅到了我发出的信号，”他说，“休息期间整间公司都松弛下来了。我们用压缩的时间讨论了更多的议题，开会的过程也变得更加有趣。”

## A WORLD HOSTILE TO REST

Without being aware of it, Roger B. was living a highly linear life. By working long hours and rarely shutting down, even when he was home, he was relentlessly spending mental energy without getting much recovery. Fatigue prompted anxiety, irritability and self-doubt, and he had very few positive sources of emotional renewal, even from his primary relationships. In the language of sports, Roger was overtraining mentally and emotionally and undertraining physically and spiritually. Because he expended precious little energy in activity and exercise, he had progressively lost endurance, strength and resilience. Because he had grown disconnected from deeply held values or a sense of purpose, the spiritual dimension represented another flat line in his life—a potential source of energy that he simply had not cultivated.

罗杰在不自知的情况下，生活已经极其趋向单线化。长时间工作，极少休息，即便在家里，他也在不停消耗自己的思维精力，从来不给自己恢复的时间。疲倦带来焦虑、易怒和自我怀疑，但是他缺乏情感再生的源泉，即使婚姻也无法带他回到正面积极的轨道。用运动术语来讲，罗杰在思维和情感上过度训练，却在体能和意志上训练不足。由于他在训练中过度投入了有限的宝贵精力，渐渐地失去了耐力、力量和灵活性。因为逐渐淡忘了自己的价值取向和人生目标，他的精神领域变成一潭死水，甚至无法调动意志精力帮助他恢复。

Roger was not much different than many of us, in part because the choices he was making are so socially sanctioned. We live in a world that celebrates work and activity, ignores renewal and recovery, and fails to recognize that both are necessary for sustained high performance. As physiologist Martin Moore-Ede, the president of Circadian Technologies and the author of The Twenty-Four-Hour Society, puts it:

罗杰跟我们中的大多数人并无不同，因为他的日常选择正是社会大众的通病。这个世界欢迎工作和活力，却无视恢复与休息，殊不知后两者正是持久的高效表现的必要因素。生理学家摩尔艾德是昼夜节律技术公司主席，还是《24小时社会》一书的作者。他说：

> At the heart of the problem is a fundamental conflict between the demands of our man-made civilization and the very design of the human brain and body. . . . Our bodies were designed to hunt by day, sleep at night and never travel more than a few dozen miles from sunrise to sunset. Now we work and play at all hours, whisk off by jet to the far side of the globe, make life-or-death decisions or place orders on foreign stock exchanges in the wee hours of the morning. The pace of technological innovation is outstripping the ability of the human race to understand the consequences. We are machine-centered in our thinking—focused on the optimization of technology and equipment—rather than human-centered—focused on the optimization of human alertness and performance.

> 问题的中心是根本性的冲突，一方是人工文明的严格要求，另一方则是人类大脑和身体的固有设计……我们的身体被大自然设计成日出而作、日落而息的模式，黎明和天黑之间徒步距离超不过几十英里。现在我们却24小时不间断地工作和娱乐，坐上飞机就能一日千里，短短一上午就能做出关乎生死的决定，或是在国外股票市场中交易。科技革新的步伐已经超过了人们思考后果的能力。我们的思维变得机械化——追求技术和设备优化，而不是人性化，专注于最大化人性和表现。

At the most practical level, our capacity to be fully engaged depends on our ability to periodically disengage. For most of us, this requires an entirely new way of thinking about how to manage our energy. Many of us treat life as a marathon that doesn’t end until it finally ends for good. Along the way, we learn strategies for conserving our limited resources. This may mean expending energy at a certain steady level at work but rarely fully engaging, or pushing very intensely on the job and then having little energy left to invest at home. Or it may mean slowly disengaging in every sphere of life, as Roger had begun to do.

从最实用的角度看，全情投入的能力取决于周期性休息的能力。对多数人来说，要做到全情投入，我们需要从新的角度思考如何管理精力。我们许多人把生活看作一场没有尽头的马拉松，人生终结才是长跑的终点。这个过程中，我们不断学习方法，让自己保留有限的精力。这意味着我们在工作中只维持一定量的精力消耗，却导致自己做不到全情投入；又或者将精力过度消耗在工作上，无法全心投入家庭；也可能意味着像罗杰一样，在生活的方方面面都变得心不在焉。

The inexorable advances in technology—meant to help us stay more connected—often serve instead to keep us from ever fully disconnecting. Consider the way that Robert Iger, the president of the Walt Disney Company, has described the impact of email on his life: “It’s just completely changed the rhythm of my workday. I try to avoid turning on the computer when I wake up, because I know if I do, I won’t read my newspapers. By the time I do log on, around 6 A.M., twenty-five messages have accumulated since I last checked before going to sleep.

科技的进步永不止息。它本该帮我们更好地感知周围的事物，然而却成为现实中导致我们无法全情投入的祸因。迪士尼公司主席艾格曾这样描述电子邮件对他的影响：“它完全改变了我工作的习惯。起床后我不愿打开电脑，因为我知道一旦开机，今天就读不成报纸了。如果我在早上6点左右登录电邮，肯定会有25封以上的未读邮件静静地躺在收件箱里，而我昨晚临睡前才刚刚查收过。

> THE DYNAMICS OF ENGAGEMENT
>

It really affects your attention span. All of a sudden, you find yourself turning around in your chair just to see what’s there. Without thinking about it, you start answering them, and before long, forty minutes have gone by. I now find myself purposely avoiding meetings just to handle the increasing volume of email. The umbilical cord to work is longer than it’s ever been.” Iger is scarcely alone. A study conducted by America Online in 2000 found that 47 percent of its subscribers took their laptops on vacation, and 26 percent continued to check their email every day.

电邮真的会影响你专心做事的时间。一旦新邮件提醒响起，你就会条件反射般地打开电脑查收，在来得及思考之前，你的手已经自动开始回复了。不知不觉， 45分钟就在回复邮件中过去了。我发现我已经开始有意地避免开会，只是为了控制不断增长的邮件数目。工作时长达到了史无前例的高度。”而艾格并非特例。美国在线网站（America Online） 2000年发起的一项研究表明， 47%的用户度假期间会带上笔记本电脑， 26%的人每天都要查收邮件。

Because we have overridden the natural rhythms that once defined our lives, the challenge is to consciously and deliberately create new boundaries. We must learn to establish stopping points in our days, inviolable times when we step off the track, cease processing information and shift our attention from achievement to restoration. Moore-Ede calls this a “time cocoon.” As Wayne Muller puts it in his lovely book Sabbath:

由于我们习惯于反天性而为，无视自然赋予的节奏，因而有意地划出工作和休息的界限更为重要。我们必须学会为一天画上休止符，强迫自己在固定的时间离开跑道，停止处理信息，把目标从工作成果转向精力恢复。摩尔艾德把它称为“时间茧蛹”。韦恩·穆勒在力作《安息日》中写道：

> The busier we are, the more important we seem to ourselves and, we imagine, to others. To be unavailable to our friends and family, to be unable to find time for the sunset (or even to know the sun has set at all), to whiz through our obligations without time for a mindful breath, this has become the model of a successful life.
>
> 我们越是忙碌，越会高看自己，认为自己对他人来说不可或缺。我们无法陪伴亲人朋友，不知疲倦，没日没夜，只管四处救火，不给自己留下喘息的时间。这就是现代社会的成功典型。

We have lost connection, Muller argues, to the simple but profound message of the Twenty-third Psalm: “He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul.” Intermittently disengaging is what allows us to passionately reengage.

穆勒说，我们已经淡忘了诗篇23篇中简单又深刻的道理：“他使我躺卧在青草地上，领我在可安歇的水边。他使我的灵魂苏醒。”不时休息会带给我们重新投入的热情。

## STRESS ADDICTION

Working at a feverish pace without breaks may actually be addictive. Stress hormones such as adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol fuel arousal and create a seductive rush—the so-called adrenaline high. When we operate at a high enough intensity for long enough, we progressively lose the capacity to shift to any other gear. Our natural inclination is to push harder when demand increases. Over time we resist precisely what would make us more effective: taking breaks and seeking restoration. In effect, we get stuck in overdrive, unable to turn off the engine.

狂热不停歇的工作节奏实际上有可能令人上瘾。压力荷尔蒙如肾上腺素、去甲肾上腺素和皮质醇会让人亢奋，创造出一种带有诱惑的冲动，也就是人们所说的肾上腺素迷幻。我们在高度紧张的状态下长时间运转，会渐渐失去换挡减速的能力。当需求增多时，我们会本能地逼迫自己。慢慢地，我们开始抗拒本能帮助我们高效运作的事物——停顿、休息和自我恢复。然后我们就会陷入超速怪圈，再也无法关闭引擎。

Take Dick Wolf, the executive producer of Law & Order and half a dozen other network television series. He once told a reporter that he had worked as many as thirty-four days consecutively, and gone as long as four years without a vacation. “The scary thing,” he explained, “is that I’ve lost the ability to shut off, even on a weekend, even when I’m up in Maine, where we have a vacation house away from it all, and even if I have nothing to do when I’m there. I find myself feeling guilty if I’m not working. I’ll think, ‘I really should be doing something.’ And I’ll almost always find something to do. It’s an inability to pull the plug and just vegetate.” It never dawned on Wolf that what he called vegetating might actually be a powerful way to refill his energy reservoir.

《法律与秩序》制片人迪克·沃夫对记者说，他曾连续34天没有周末，整整4年没有休过一次假。“最可怕的是，即便是周末，即使在缅因度假，即使根本没有事情需要我操心，我仍旧停不下来。停止工作会让我产生负罪感。我一定要找点事情做，事实是我总能找到事情做。关闭电源、无所事事变成了最困难的事情。”沃夫或许没有意识到，他口中的无所事事或许正是补充精力储备的绝佳途径。

For Mark Ethridge, a former managing editor of The Charlotte Observer, the costs of his own addiction seemed clearer. “More and more what I find is that you don’t really live in the present anymore,” he explained. “You’re never fully engaged in what you’re doing at any given moment, because what you really want to do is finish it in order to get on to something else. You kind of skim along the surface of life. It’s very frustrating.”

对《夏洛特观察报》前主编马克·埃斯里奇来说，成瘾的代价更为明显。“我发现自己越来越不能集中在当下的任务上，不论何时何地做什么都不能全情投入，因为你的脑海里只想赶紧结束这件事，好开始下一件事情，生活好像停留在浅尝辄止的层面，真令人伤感。”

Any addictive behavior—including work—prompts a highly linear form of energy expenditure. It is no wonder that efforts to rehabilitate drug and alcohol addicts are referred to as “recovery.” “Overwork is this decade’s cocaine, the problem without a name,” says Bryan Robinson, who has written widely about the phenomenon and estimates that as many as 25 percent of Americans have the addiction. “Workaholism is an obsessive-compulsive disorder,” he writes, “that manifests itself through self-imposed demands, an inability to regulate work habits and an overindulgence in work—to the exclusion of most other life activities.” Unlike most addictions, workaholism is often admired, encouraged and materially well rewarded. The costs are more long term. Researchers have found that those who describe themselves as workaholics have a significantly higher than average incidence of alcohol abuse, divorce and stress-related illnesses.

任何成瘾行为，包括工作，都会导致精力储备急剧消耗。嗜毒者和嗜酒者的戒瘾过程被称为重塑习惯，这并非巧合。“过度工作是这个时代的可卡因。”布莱恩·罗宾森说，他曾撰文描述这种社会现象，文中估计， 25%的美国人都存在这样的问题。“工作狂是一种强迫症，通过自我强加的要求，无法约束工作习惯，放纵自己沉迷工作，忽视一切工作以外的事情。” 工作狂不像其他的瘾症被视作有害，却往往备受推崇，甚至回报丰厚，可怕的代价则长期潜伏。研究者已经发现，自称工作狂的人比普通人更易酗酒、离婚，产生其他压力相关的病症。

Under the pretext of research for this book, Tony decided to attend a Workaholics Anonymous meeting in New York City, near his home. In truth, he was also curious to see if his own work habits fit the definition. When Tony got to the meeting, there were four other people gathered around a table in a church basement. It turned out that the group’s size hadn’t increased significantly since its founding a decade ago—hardly a surprise when you think about it. How many workaholics would be willing to take time out to attend a meeting about working too hard? This one lasted an hour, and as Tony was leaving, one of the participants approached him. “Welcome to the French Resistance,” the man said with a sly smile. “There are five million workaholics in New York, and you’ve just met the only four who are in recovery.”

在本书的前期准备中，托尼决定参加一场工作狂匿名互助小组会。他也的确好奇自己的工作习惯是否符合工作狂的范畴。当托尼到达位于教堂地下室的会场时，只有4个人围坐在圆桌旁。原来，从10年前建会以来，互助小组的规模一直没有显著的增长。想一想其实不难解释，有多少工作狂愿意花时间参加一个致力于克服过于勤奋的会议？这场会议进行了1个小时。当托尼要离开时，一位参与者向他走来。“欢迎加入法国保卫战，”他露出一个促狭的微笑，“纽约有500万工作狂，你刚刚见到了仅有的4名正在康复的人。”

## DEATH FROM OVERWORK

It is not the intensity of energy expenditure that produces burnout, impaired performance and physical breakdown, but rather the duration of expenditure without recovery. In Japan, the term karoshi can be translated literally as “death from overwork”—most commonly from heart attack and stroke. The first case of karoshi was reported in 1969. The Japanese Ministry of Labor began to publish statistics on the syndrome in 1987 and the National Defense Council for Victims of Karoshi was launched the following year. Some ten thousand deaths a year in Japan are now attributed to karoshi, and research shows that there are five key factors:

高强度的精力消耗并非是过度疲劳、效能打折和体力崩溃的直接原因，持续消耗加恢复不足才导致了这样的后果。日本人创造了“过劳死”的概念，通常表现形式为心脏病和中风。第一起过劳死案例发生在1969年。日本劳工部自1987年开始公布过劳死相关数据，全国过劳死受害者委员会于次年建立。每年，日本有数以万计的死亡案例与过劳相关。研究者发现过劳死亡的5个明显诱因：

* Extremely long hours that interfere with normal recovery and rest patterns 妨碍正常恢复和休息模式的超长时间工作
* Night work that interferes with normal recovery and rest patterns 妨碍正常恢复和休息模式的夜班工作
* Working without holidays or breaks 无假期无休息的工作
* High-pressure work without breaks 高压无休息的工作
* Extremely demanding physical labor and continuously stressful work 高强度体能消耗和持续高压的工作

What these five factors have in common is a pattern of chronic energy expenditure and an absence of intermittent recovery. The number of Japanese workers who put in more than 3,120 hours a year—an average of more than sixty hours a week—increased from three million, or 15 percent of the workforce, in 1975, to seven million, or 24 percent, in 1988. One case study described a worker who died suddenly at the age of forty-five. It turned out that he had worked thirteen consecutive days, including six successive night shifts. His job was assembling engine parts for Mazda Motor Company, and he worked on a line where the speed was two minutes per car. The methods devised to assure maximum efficiency were so unforgiving that workers had almost no time at all to recover. “Under this production method,” the researchers concluded, “the worker resembles a mouse running helplessly in a rotating wheel in order to avoid electric shock. . . . ” No comparable research on the health or consequences of overwork exists in the United States, but America is the only country in the world in which employees work more hours per week than the Japanese.

这五种诱因的共同点在于长期的精力消耗模式和缺乏间歇休息。每年工作3120小时（平均每周超过60小时）的日本工人从1975年的300万增长至1988年的700万，劳动力占比从15%增至24%。某个案件中，一位年仅45岁的工人突然身亡，专案调查组发现他已连续工作13天，其中包含连续6天的夜班。他在马自达汽车公司的引擎组装线上工作，工厂的标准是20分钟组装完一辆车。本意是提高效率的方式让工人们吃不消，几乎没有时间休息。“在这种生产方式下，”研究者总结道，“工人们就像旋转轮上无助的小白鼠，一旦停下就会被电击惩罚。”美国还没有类似的针对过劳影响的研究，但美国是全球唯一一个每周工作时间超过日本的国家。

Nancy Woodhull was the epitome of high energy, a founding publisher of USA Today and a highly successful executive with a very busy and varied life. “I’m not the type of person,” she once explained, “who can just sit around the pool and not do anything, so I take a Dictaphone to the pool, and when I have ideas, I can record them. Not being able to do that would be very stressful to me. People will say to me, ‘Nancy, relax, recharge your energy,’ and I say, ‘I’m being energized by getting these ideas down.’ Having access to a Dictaphone allows you to be more productive. So does having a cellular phone, and so does having a computer. You take all these tools and there really is no need for downtime. Anyone can find me, anywhere, anytime.”

南希·伍德哈尔是精力充沛的职业经理人，也是《今日美国》的创刊人之一。作为典型的成功人士，她曾说：“我不是那种可以坐在游泳池旁放空脑袋的人。我总会带一支录音笔去游泳池，有了灵感就记录下来。夺走我的录音笔会让我感到不适。人们总是对我说，‘南希，歇歇吧，给自己充充电’，我会说，‘把这些点子记下来就是充电’。一支录音笔会让你更加高效，手机和电脑也是。把这些东西都带上，我就不需要停工休息了。大家可以随时随地找到我。”

Less than ten years after she described this modus operandi, Woodhull died of cancer. She was fifty-two years old. There is no way of determining conclusively whether there was any relationship between Woodhull’s work habits and her early death, but her profile was not significantly different from many of the Japanese who die from karoshi. There is also considerable evidence that highly linear forms of behavior—too much eating, too little sleep, too much hostility, too little physical activity, too much continuous stress—lead to a higher incidence of illness and even early death.

然而，就在慷慨分享工作方式后不到10年，伍德哈尔就因癌症去世了，享年55岁。她的工作习惯与早逝是否相关还不能下定论，但她的情况跟过劳死的日本工人并无二致。许多证据表明，高度单线化的生活方式，包括暴饮暴食、睡眠缺失、心焦气躁、缺少锻炼、长期压力过大等都有高致病风险，甚至可能导致过早死亡。

Basedow’s disease represents a precursor to karoshi—a response to highly linear stress. It shows up especially in athletes who have overtrained, pushing themselves relentlessly with very limited recovery. Among its symptoms are increased resting heart rate, decreased appetite, disturbed sleep, higher resting blood pressure, irritability, emotional instability, loss of motivation and increased incidence of injuries and infections. We see many of these symptoms in the executives with whom we work.

巴塞多氏病是过劳死的先兆，也是长期承担压力的后果，在过度训练的运动员中尤其高发，因为他们总是不断突破自己的极限，却极少休息和恢复。巴塞多氏病的症状有：静止心率升高，胃口不佳，睡眠不良，静止血压高，易怒，情绪不稳，失去动力，受伤、感染几率增大等。我们也在客户中发现了许多同样的症状。

William D., a midlevel manager at a large consumer company, came to us with one of the most common performance barriers that we see. In the mornings, he was full of energy, and he charged through his obligations at high intensity. He estimated that he got more than 70 percent of his day’s work done before lunch. By early afternoon, however, his energy flagged considerably, and with it his enthusiasm and his focus. By the time he got home, he felt completely wiped out and complained that he had nothing left to give. He wondered if he might have Lyme disease or chronic fatigue syndrome and went to his doctor to be checked out. The tests came back negative. What then was the explanation? Put simply, demand was increasing while his capacity was diminishing. At fifty, William wasn’t as resilient as he had been at forty or thirty. To maintain his current capacity, he had to be more attentive to intermittent recovery.

威廉是一家大型消费品企业的中层管理人员，他的问题是一种最常见的表现障碍。早上到达办公室时他还精力满满，然后高强度地做事，在午餐之前已经完成了一天中70%的工作。然而刚到下午，他的精力就摇旗投降了，连同他的工作热情和专注力一同丧失。等晚上回到家，他感觉自己已经被掏空了，拿不出一点精力分给家人。他怀疑自己患上了莱姆病或慢性疲劳综合症，就预约医生做身体检查。检查结果是否定的。这到底怎么回事？简单来说，就是压力增加而能力不足。 50岁的威廉已经不具备他40岁或30岁的恢复能力了。为了维持现有体力，他应当更注重间歇休息。

In the aftermath of his work with us, William made one relatively simple change in the way he worked. He began taking a break every 90 to 120 minutes, during which he ate something, drank some water and took at least a brief walk. Based on this change alone, within two weeks William estimated a 30 percent increase in his energy in the afternoons.

结束我们的咨询课程后，威廉在工作安排中加入一项小小的变化。他开始每90～120分钟休息一次，吃点东西喝点水，出去走一走。仅靠这一项改变，两周时间内，威廉估计自己下午的精力上升了30%。

## WHEN WHAT YOU HAVE IS NOT ENOUGH

Regularly renewing our energy insures that we can sustain full engagement—so long as demand remains constant. But what happens when increased demand overwhelms our capacity and even a full tank is not enough?

定期恢复精力确保我们可以持续全情投入——只要生活对我们的要求不会改变。但一旦生活的要求超出了我们的能力，即使全情投入也达不到要求，我们该怎么办呢？

The answer is paradoxical—and precisely the opposite of what you’ve probably been told most of your life. To build capacity, we must systematically expose ourselves to more stress—followed by adequate recovery. Challenging a muscle past its current limits prompts a phenomenon known as supercompensation. Faced with a demand that exceeds the muscle’s current capacity, the body responds by building more muscle fibers in anticipation of the next stimulus.

这个问题的答案充满了矛盾，也违反了常识。为了提升能力，我们需要系统性地增大压力，随后得到充分休息。提升肌肉极限，就要说到“超量补偿”的概念。若现有的肌肉力量不足以达到要求，身体就会通过制造更多肌肉纤维来应对下一次刺激。

We grow at all levels by expending energy beyond our normal limits, and then recovering.

通过超极限消耗精力并有效恢复，我们会在各方面成长。

The same is true, we have found, of “muscles” at all levels—emotional, mental and spiritual. The catch is that we instinctively resist pushing beyond our current comfort zones. Homeostasis is a state of equilibrium—the biological maintenance of the status quo. When we challenge our equilibrium, discomfort serves as an early warning system, alerting us that we are entering uncharted territory and urging us to return to safe ground. In the case of real danger, the experience of alarm is useful and self-protective. Subject a muscle to excessive demand, for example, and you risk significant injury. But expose the muscle to ordinary demand and it won’t grow.

同理，我们发现情感、思维和意志层面的“肌肉”也有增长空间。人们从本能上抗拒走出自己的舒适圈。恒定性是一种平衡，是维持生理现状的表现。一旦我们挑战这种平衡，就会触发警报系统，提醒我们正在进入未知领域，敦促我们返回安全地带。在遇到真正的危险时，这种警报非常有用，有助于我们自我保护。因此即使是为了塑造肌肉，我们也需要冒着受伤的危险。但如果停留在正常范围内使用肌肉，肌肉永远不会增长。

Expanding capacity requires a willingness to endure short-term discomfort in the service of long-term reward.

拓展能力需要，为了长期回报接受短期不适。

The same paradoxical phenomenon applies to achieving long-term satisfaction and well-being. “We can experience pleasure without any investment of psychic energy, whereas enjoyment happens only as a result of unusual investments of attention . . . ,” writes psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, author of Flow. “The best moments [in our lives] usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.” Most of us have experienced this phenomenon. The intensity of pleasure that we derive from a given activity tends to diminish over time. Much as we fear change, the deepest satisfaction comes from our willingness to expose ourselves to new challenges and engage in novel experiences.

追求长期效益和健康时也会出现同样的矛盾。“我们可以不投入任何意志精力就获得乐趣，但是只有在倾注关心时才谈得上享受。”《心流》的作者、心理学家米哈里·契克森米哈写道，“最佳时刻，往往发生在一个人的身心为了达成艰难目标或完成有意义的事情，而自愿达到极限的时候。”大多数人都有过这种体验。一件事情的乐趣会随着时间逐渐减少。即便我们惧怕改变，自愿应对挑战、敢于革新依旧能够为我们带来深深的满足感。

The willingness to challenge our comfort zones depends partly on our degree of underlying security. To whatever degree we are consumed by anxious concerns and attempts to fill deficits—for energy, or material security, or self-esteem—we are less willing to expose ourselves to any discomfort. When there isn’t much fuel in our tanks and our inner experience is that we feel threatened, we tend to hoard the energy we have and use our limited stores in the service of self-protection. We refer to this phenomenon as defense spending. Accurately assessing the level of threat in our lives is critical if we are to continue to grow rather than forever defending what we have.

是否愿意挑战舒适区有部分取决于我们潜在的安全感。不管我们多么焦虑地尝试填补空缺，都不会倾向于做出让自己不适的选择。一旦燃料不足，感觉到对自我存在的威胁，我们会选择贮存现有的精力，利用有限的资源保护自我。我们把这种现象称作防卫支出。如果想获得持续成长而非固步自封，准确评估生活的威胁等级就尤为重要。

## VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY STORMS

Throughout our lives, we face storms of varying levels of intensity in all dimensions: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. When the force of the storm is greater than we can handle physically, the result might be a broken bone, or a heart attack. The first imperative is to protect the injured limb or organ from further stress. A physician puts a broken arm in a cast to protect the bone as it heals, or prescribes bed rest immediately following a heart attack. But we can’t leave the cast on or remain sedentary for too long. Inactivity very quickly causes atrophy and loss of strength.

我们在整个人生中都会面对大小不一的风暴，体能、情感、思维和意志层面比比皆是。当风暴的力量非现有体力所能抗衡，可能会导致骨折或者心脏病，此时最需要做的就是保护受伤的部分不再暴露于危险之下。外科医生会用石膏保护断裂的骨头，或要求心脏病患者卧床休息。但我们不能一直佩戴石膏或者一直躺在床上，因为静止不动会导致肌肉萎缩无力。

Rehabilitation is the process by which we systematically build back capacity. The approach is always the same: gradual and incremental exposure to increasing doses of stress. Push too hard or too quickly, and you are likely to get hurt again. This is true of a broken arm or a damaged heart, but it applies equally to other dimensions in which sudden storms have sapped our strength. If you are the victim of a violent crime, or lose a loved one, or get fired from a job, the first need is for healing, recovery and time to regroup. Rebuilding energy capacity requires gradually reexposing ourselves to the demands of the world that dealt us the setback in the first place. So long as sufficient healing has occurred, it is often possible to build capacity past our previous limits.

复健是我们系统性地恢复能力的过程。复健的方式大同小异：让受伤的部分承受从轻到重的压力。用力过猛或操之过急都会导致二度受伤，不仅是骨折的手臂或受伤的心脏，其他层面遭受打击时同样如此。如果你是暴力事件的受害者，刚刚失去心爱的人，或者最近被开除，你的第一选择应该是疗伤和康复，给自己重整旗鼓的时间。重塑能力需要把自己再一次置于曾经受伤的环境。只要恢复得充足，我们的极限都会达到新的高度。

The same principle applies to building capacity by conscious choice. Think about an infant venturing away from his mother, but turning back frequently to make sure that she is still there. The infant is testing his current comfort zone. His mother’s smile of reassurance is a source of emotional recovery and positive renewal. It makes him feel empowered to take a few steps further into the unknown, to continue expanding his capacity. Without that reassurance, he comes scurrying back to his mother. We are not so different as adults. When we feel threatened, we tend to retreat. Recovery is a means of detoxifying and refueling so that we can return to the storm with renewed energy. When we feel challenged rather than threatened, we are more willing to extend ourselves, even if that means taking some risk and experiencing some discomfort along the way.

这条规律同样适用于主动拓展能力的情况。试想，一个婴儿冒险离开母亲身边，一定会经常折回来看她是不是还在原地，他是在测试自己的安全区。母亲宽慰的微笑是孩子情感精力的源泉，让他敢于向未知前进，继续挑战自己的极限，若这一点得不到保证，他就会跌跌撞撞地投回母亲的怀抱。成年人也一样，我们遇到威胁也会退缩。恢复是治疗和鼓励的过程，我们通过恢复才得以重新投入风暴之中。因此，当我们面临挑战而不是威胁时，也会愿意主动拓展自我，即使意味着需要冒风险或接受不适。

When we first suggested to Roger B. that he lacked sufficient capacity in part because he hadn’t exposed himself to sufficient stress, he was incredulous. “My life is more stressful than ever,” he insisted. “I’m getting less help from my boss, and I’ve got more people to supervise, fewer resources and more competition. If what you’re saying is right, how come I’m not getting stronger?” Many of our clients initially raise the same question.

当我们第一次向罗杰提出，缺乏能力在某种程度上是因为他没有承担足够的压力时，他觉得难以置信。“我的生活压力从来没有这样大过，”他坚持道，“我的老板帮不了我，我还要管理众多的下属，市场资源越来越少，竞争越来越多。如果你们的理论是正确的，我怎么没有变得更强？”许多客户最初都会提出这样的问题。

The answer, we tell them, is that the key to expanding capacity is both to push beyond one’s ordinary limits and to regularly seek recovery, which is when growth actually occurs. There was no area of Roger’s life in which he was doing both. At the physical and spiritual level, he wasn’t spending enough energy to build capacity. Because he was undertraining those muscles, they continued to atrophy.

对此，我们的答案是，能力拓展的关键在于，既要超出日常的极限，又要定期休整恢复，二者兼备才能成长。罗杰显然没有做到后者。他在体能和意志层面没有尽力拓展能力，而这两方面的“肌肉”长期使用不足，只会继续萎缩下去。

In the other two dimensions—mental and emotional—Roger was overtraining, subjecting himself to excessive stress without sufficient intermittent recovery. The result was that he felt overwhelmed. His solution was simply to keep pushing. What he needed was time to detoxify and change channels in order to periodically renew mentally and emotionally. Roger was pushing himself too hard in some dimensions and not hard enough in others. The ultimate consequence was the same: diminished capacity in the face of rising demand.

在思维和情感层面，罗杰又犯了过度训练的错误，没有得到充足的休整，便把自己一次次推入过度的压力当中，结果只能让自己越来越难以应对压力。因为不重视休息，他只会继续逼迫极限，导致恶性循环。他需要的是排毒的时间和改变的方法，允许自己定期恢复情感和思维精力。某些层面过度训练和另一些层面训练不足都会导致同样的结果：在生活越来越高的要求下，我们的能力只会越来越弱。

## BEAR IN MIND

* Our most fundamental need as human beings is to spend and recover energy. We call this oscillation. 精力的消耗与恢复是人类最基本的需求。我们称其为波动。
* The opposite of oscillation is linearity: too much energy expenditure without recovery or too much recovery without sufficient energy expenditure. 波动的反面是直线：精力消耗大于恢复，或者精力恢复大于消耗。
* Balancing stress and recovery is critical to high performance both individually and organizationally. 压力与恢复的平衡对于个人或团体的高效表现都至关重要。
* We must sustain healthy oscillatory rhythms at all four levels of what we term the “performance pyramid”: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. 我们必须在四个层面都保持健康波动的节奏，即“效能金字塔”的组成部分：体能，情感，思维和意志。
* We build emotional, mental and spiritual capacity in precisely the same way that we build physical capacity. We must systematically expose ourselves to stress beyond our normal limits, followed by adequate recovery. 我们培养情感、思维和意志能力的方法与体力相同，必须系统性地将自己置于超出惯常极限的压力当中，并在过后得到充分恢复。
* Expanding capacity requires a willingness to endure short-term discomfort in the service of long-term reward. 拓展能力需要为了长期回报接受短期的不适。
