# Spiritual Energy: He Who Has a Why to Live

The quantity of energy we have to spend at any given moment is a reflection of our physical capacity. Our motivation to spend what we have is largely a spiritual issue. Fundamentally, spiritual energy is a unique force for action in all dimensions of our lives. It is the most powerful source of our motivation, perseverance and direction. We define “spiritual” not in the religious sense, but rather in more simple and elemental terms: the connection to a deeply held set of values and to a purpose beyond our self-interest. At the practical level, anything that ignites the human spirit serves to drive full engagement and to maximize performance in whatever mission we are on. The key muscle that fuels spiritual energy is character—the courage and conviction to live by our values, even when doing so requires personal sacrifice and hardship. Supportive spiritual muscles include passion, commitment, integrity and honesty.

我们随时可以取用的精力储备量反映了身体素质，取用精力的动机则属于精神层面的范畴。本质上说，意志精力是一股掌管所有维度行为的独特力量。它是动机最丰富的源泉，指点方向。这里的意志并非是指宗教概念，而是最简单最基本的定义——通向最深层的价值取向和超越个人利益的意图。实际上，无论我们有什么使命，任何能够点燃人类精神的事物都有助于全情投入、促进最佳表现。意志精力的关键动力在于性格品质——按照价值取向生活的勇气和信念，即使面对艰难困苦和个人牺牲也在所不惜。意志精力的支持部分包括激情、奉献、正直与诚实。

Spiritual energy is sustained by balancing a commitment to others with adequate self-care. Put another way, the capacity to live by our deepest values depends on regularly renewing our spirit—seeking ways to rest and rejuvenate and to reconnect with the values that we find most inspiring and meaningful. When we lack sufficient spiritual energy, we must find systematic ways to go deeper—to challenge our complacency and expediency. In Roger B.’s case, the disconnection from a compelling sense of purpose had robbed him of passion and of any clear sense of direction. He operated instead in survival mode, doing what was necessary to fill immediate needs and to get by day-to-day. Often, he felt like a victim. Roger didn’t think much about the long-term consequences of his choices largely because he didn’t have a vision of what he wanted from life or where he was headed. The result was that all of his energy systems were compromised.

在为他人奉献和照顾自己之间找到平衡，意志精力才能延续下去。换句话说，按照最深层的价值观生活，取决于有规律地促进意志精力的再生——找到休息和再生的方式，重新发现我们所认为最有激情和意义的价值。若意志精力不能满足需求，则需要系统培养，挑战我们的自满感觉和一时的权益之计。以罗杰为例，严重的目标缺失感抹灭了他的激情，阻碍了他前进的方向，因而他转入生存模式，只能满足最基本的生存需求，过一天算一天。他还常常将自己塑造成受害者的形象。罗杰之所以不考虑自身行为的长期后果，很大程度是因为他不清楚自己的人生意义和前进的方向，最终导致所有精力系统都受到了伤害。

It is often around tragedy that people discover the importance of spiritual energy. When the actor Christopher Reeve became a quadriplegic following a horseback-riding accident in 1995, it would hardly have been surprising if he had felt overcome by despair. Very briefly, he said later, he contemplated suicide. But within a short time, Reeve managed to tap into a fierce source of spiritual energy—the desire to continue to be there for his family, to help find a cure for his condition and to continue to make a contribution in the world—not least by serving as an inspiration for others in his situation. This fierce sense of purpose helped Reeve to mobilize hope and optimism and to move forward with focus and clarity, even with a severely compromised source of physical energy and a dramatically increased vulnerability to fear, frustration and despair. Spiritual energy effectively saved his life.

人们往往在悲剧发生之后才会意识到意志精力的重要性。著名演员克里斯托弗·里夫1995年在骑马事故中不幸瘫痪，很自然地整日被绝望情绪笼罩。后来他提到过，自己甚至有过自杀的念头。但是他很快就找到了自己的意志精力来源——想要继续陪伴家人，寻找此类病症的治疗方法，继续为这个世界贡献力量。这种强烈的意愿帮助里夫振作起来，在体能严重不足、极易产生脆弱绝望情绪的情况下，最终依靠希望、乐观恢复了专注和清晰的思维。意志精力有效地挽救了他的生命。

The employees of the bond trading company Cantor Fitzgerald collectively drew upon a deep reservoir of spiritual energy in the face of a very different tragedy. The company’s headquarters was on four of the top floors of One World Trade Center, and more than two-thirds of the one thousand employees in Cantor’s New York offices died on September 11, 2001. The company’s computer systems and massive amounts of data were also destroyed, and it was unclear whether Cantor itself could survive. The remaining employees were understandably shocked, grief-stricken and in many cases traumatized. In energy terms, the physical, emotional and mental drain on their energy capacity was enormous.

债券交易公司坎托·菲茨杰拉德的员工面对无常灾难也展现了巨大的意志力量。这家公司的总部位于世贸中心的顶层，纽约办公室的一千名员工有三分之二都在“9·11事件”中不幸罹难。计算机系统和大量数据遭到损毁，公司前途生死未卜。幸免于难的人沉浸在震惊和悲痛中久久不能平复，许多人遭受精神创伤。从精力角度来看，这场灾难对体能、情感和思维精力的消耗是巨大的。

What allowed Cantor’s employees to move forward, it turned out, was tapping into a compelling sense of purpose. Efforts to save the firm certainly served their own financial needs, but their cause became much bigger than that. Within days, Howard Lutnick, Cantor’s chairman, announced that 25 percent of any profits the firm earned during the subsequent five years would go to the families of employees who had lost their lives. This decision mobilized the remaining employees to fight for a purpose beyond themselves. The survivors became “a band of brothers,” as one of them put it, drawn together by the shared tragedy and the challenge ahead.

支持坎托的员工度过难关的是强烈的目标感。挽救公司当然有利于个人财务，但他们的使命远远不止于此。悲剧发生几天后，公司总裁霍华德·卢特尼克发表声明，公司在未来5年内所有盈利的25%将作为抚恤金发放给遇难员工的家属。这项决策让幸存的员工拥有了超越个人利益的奋斗目标，他们把自己称作“兄弟连”，因为共同的悲剧和挑战而凝聚在一起。

The result was a fierce level of dedication. Employees began to work twelve-to sixteen-hour days. According to Heidi Olson, an employee who had left the firm but felt compelled to return after September 11: “Everything we took for granted was gone. So I just did whatever had to be done. It is like being a mom—in that spiritual sense of doing whatever is needed for the good of the family.” Along the way, Cantor Fitzgerald employees discovered previously untapped emotional resources—patience, compassion, the ability to uncomplainingly endure difficult makeshift working conditions—that helped them get through the trauma. Their commitment to a higher mission helped them to focus and persevere for long hours, even as they operated on limited sleep. If there was a risk in the long term, it was that the failure to adequately replenish their physical, mental and emotional energy reserves might eventually prompt burnout and breakdown. In any case, it is hard to imagine a more vivid example of the profound source of spiritual energy that can be tapped—even in the worst adversity—by a shared vision and a commitment to a mission larger than - one’s self.

整个公司戮力同心的效果是惊人的。坎托员工每天自发工作12～16个小时。海蒂·奥尔森本已离职，“9·11事件”后又重新回到公司。“我们曾看作理所当然的事物都失去了。我只是做了自己应该做的事情。就好像一个母亲，要为家庭付出一切。”在奋斗的过程中，坎托公司的员工们汲取了未曾发觉的情感——耐心、怜悯，面对临时的倒班工作也毫无怨言。这些最终成为帮助他们渡过难关的力量。坚定的目标使得他们在睡眠有限时也能集中精力长时间工作。如果说存在长期的风险，那就是得不到充分恢复的体能、思维和情感精力有可能最终会导致衰竭而崩溃。很难再找出一个能够如此生动的例子，说明在最艰难的情况下，共同的目标和超越自我的信念才能激发出最磅礴的意志力量。

To understand the significance of purpose on a more everyday level, consider the case of Ann F., a high-level executive at a large cosmetics company. For much of her adult life, Ann had tried unsuccessfully to quit smoking, blaming her failure on a lack of self-discipline. Smoking took a quiet but undeniable toll on her health and her productivity at work—decreased endurance from shortness of breath, more sick days than her colleagues, and nicotine cravings that distracted her during long meetings. She was obviously aware that smoking put her at considerably higher risk of an early death. On the other hand, smoking provided a strong source of sensory pleasure, and it was a way to allay her anxiety and to manage social stress. Above all, the physical addiction had an overwhelming hold over her.

若要从日常生活说明目标的重要性，我们来看看安的例子。安是一家大型化妆品公司的高管。成年以后，安一直尝试戒烟却没有成功，她把戒烟失败归结为自律性差。抽烟渐渐开始影响她的身体和工作——呼吸短促导致耐力变差，经常请病假，尼古丁上瘾时无法在会议上集中精神。她意识到，烟草已经将她笼罩在过早死亡的风险之下。而另一方面，抽烟是她的长期爱好，也是减轻焦虑、缓解社会压力的有效方式。最重要的是，她的身体已经对尼古丁产生了很强的依赖性。

On the day that Ann learned she was pregnant for the first time, she decided to quit smoking right then and there. Until the day that her child was born, she never picked up another cigarette. She resumed smoking before she had left the hospital. A year later, Ann became pregnant for a second time, and once again she stopped smoking for the subsequent nine months. As she had the first time, she was easily able to overcome her intermittent cravings, but true to her first experience, she resumed smoking right after her second child was born. “I - don’t understand it,” she told us plaintively.

当安得知自己怀孕了，她决定立刻戒烟。一直到孩子出生，她都没有碰过香烟。不过生下孩子出院之前，她就迫不及待地重拾香烟。一年之后，安第二次怀孕了，她又一次停止吸烟。就像第一次那样，在9个月的孕期里她很容易就克服了对尼古丁的渴望，却在孩子出生后立即恢复吸烟。“我也不明白怎么回事。”她哀怨地对我们说。

The explanation was actually very simple. When Ann was able to connect the impact of smoking to a deeper purpose—the health of her unborn child—she gained access to a wellspring of focused purpose. Quitting was easy. Once her child was born and she no longer had such a clear sense of purpose, the lure of smoking became compelling again. Understanding cognitively that it was unhealthy to smoke, feeling guilty about it on an emotional level, and even experiencing its negative effects physically were all insufficient motivations to change her behavior.

原因其实很简单。当抽烟关系到一件更为重大的事情——未出世孩子的健康，她就从专注的目标中获得了更多的力量。一旦孩子出生，使命感消失，她就很难经得起烟草的诱惑。在认知层面意识到吸烟有害健康，在情感层面为吸烟的行为感到惭愧，甚至在身体层面感受到吸烟的负面影响，都不足以构成安改变行为的动机。

To quit smoking, Ann needed the unique motivation that comes from connecting to a spiritual source of energy. We helped her to reconnect to that energy in three ways. The first was simply to point out that secondhand smoke is itself insidious, and that if she continued smoking she would be exposing her children to a health hazard, as well as sending a signal to them that smoking is acceptable. We also pushed Ann to face the reality that continuing to smoke increased dramatically the odds that her children would grow up without a mother. Because family and concern for others were among her key values, they became a source of motivation to quit smoking. Finally, we helped Ann to acknowledge that smoking was a primary cause of her poor health and her low energy, both of which took a serious toll on her performance at work and ultimately on her capacity to be engaged at home.

若要成功戒烟，安需要精神层面的独特动机。我们想出三种理由。首先，二手烟本身就是潜在的危险，如果她继续抽烟，就会威胁到孩子们的健康，还等于向他们传达了吸烟无害的信号。我们也迫使安认清现实，继续抽烟会严重危害她的健康，孩子们可能会过早失去母亲。对家人的关怀是安重要价值的取向，它成为了戒烟的有力动机。最后，在我们的引导下，安意识到，抽烟是造成她亚健康状态和精力不足的罪魁祸首，导致她在工作中表现不佳，也最终影响了她与家人相处时的精力。

More than at any other level, spiritual energy expenditure and renewal are deeply intertwined and tend to occur simultaneously. Nearly all contemplative traditions talk about spiritual “work” and spiritual “practice.” These activities may be aimed at being of service to others or deepening our compassion or helping us to experience our interconnectedness. Spiritual renewal, on the other hand, comes from feeling inspired by and reconnected to our sense of purpose and our deepest values.

与其他层面相比，意志精力的消耗与更新有着更为紧密的联系，往往同时发生。几乎所有的自省传统都会提到精神功课和精神实践，或为了服务他人或为深化人们的怜悯之心，或为了帮助人们体验内心联结。而意志精力的更新恰巧来源于价值观和使命感的启发和重获。

Some activities generate considerable spiritual renewal without demanding significant energy expenditure. These include walking in nature, reading an inspirational book, listening to music, or hearing a great speaker. Spiritual practices, by contrast, can be renewing and demanding at the same time. Meditation, for example, requires mobilizing highly focused attention to quiet the mind, but may also prompt a rejuvenating experience of expansive openness, connectedness and even joy. Like yoga, meditation is a practice that can cut across all dimensions, building spiritual capacity while also providing mental and emotional recovery.

有些活动不需太多精力就能大幅获得精力再生，例如在自然中散步，读一本给人启迪的书，听音乐，或者听一场精彩的演讲。反之，精神功课既是精力消耗的过程，也是精力更新的过程。例如，冥想需要调动高度的注意力使思维平静，同时也会带来意志的开阔、内心的沟通，甚至喜悦的情感。冥想像瑜伽一样贯穿所有的精力层面，构造意志能力的同时，也提供思维和情感的再生源泉。

Prayer, too, requires the effort of concentration and contemplation, but can also serve as a source of emotional and spiritual comfort. Reflecting regularly on our deepest values and holding ourselves accountable to them is both difficult and taxing, but it may also be inspiring and energizing. At a more basic level, devoting time and energy to our children can be both a spiritual “practice”—sacrificing our own pressing needs for theirs—and also a rich source of renewal, emotionally and spiritually. The same is true of all service to others, which involves considerable effort and even inconvenience, but may also provide a profound source of meaning and deep satisfaction.

祷告需要集中精神，也同样会带来情感和精神上的安慰。经常思考我们的价值取向并做出与之契合的行为实属不易，但它们同时也是激发灵感和动力的方式。就更基本的层面而言，为孩子投入时间和精力也是一种精神实践——牺牲自己的精力服务他人，同时也是情感和精神的丰富源泉。这一道理同样适用于所有为他人服务的时刻，需要投入大量的精力，甚至会给自己带来不便，但是同样会带来深切的意义和满足感。

## GARY A.: APATHY, DISAFFECTION

At forty-seven, Gary A. was a top executive at a large financial services firm. After twenty years with the company, he felt increasingly disengaged. He had begun to question why exactly he was doing his job, and whether it was really worth it. He was generously compensated, but the more we talked with him, the more it became clear that he hungered to do more than just increase his net worth and climb the executive ladder in his company. He felt a parallel hunger in his personal life. He and his wife had divorced ten years earlier, and while they shared custody of their two daughters, his travel schedule and long hours had limited his time with them. Both daughters were now in their twenties, living in different cities, and his regrets ran deep, especially about the lost opportunities to connect with them through their shared love of sports. While Gary had been an excellent athlete himself, and both girls had played soccer and basketball all through high school, he had rarely made it to any of their games.

42岁的加里是一家大型金融服务公司的高管。在公司耕耘20年有余，他感觉自己越来越难以投入工作，并开始质疑自己工作的动机。公司给他的回报是丰厚的酬劳，但随着深入交流，我们发现，他想要的不仅是收入增加、职位升迁。他需要填补个人生活的空缺。加里与妻子离婚10年了，虽然两人共同拥有两个女儿的监护权，但是频繁的长期出差导致他无法陪伴女儿。两个孩子现在已经长大成人，在不同的城市里各自生活，他的懊悔反而更深一层，后悔没有通过运动爱好与女儿沟通交流。加里自己是一位出色的运动员，两个女儿在高中时期分别是足球、篮球运动员，他却很少到场加油。

When we asked Gary what might give him a greater sense of meaning and purpose in his life, he couldn’t come up with an answer at work. Once we opened the possibility to the rest of his life, he answered without missing a beat: “Coaching kids.” It was too late with his own kids, he said, but coaching struck him as a way that he could make a contribution and feel fulfilled. It happened that Gary lived near a group foster home for orphans and children whose parents had been deemed unfit to care for them. Gary had passed the home on his way to work for years and barely given it a second thought. Now he decided to try volunteering his services. As it happened, the administration was looking for someone to coach its boy’s basketball team. The job required a commitment of three nights a week, along with games on most Saturdays, but Gary was determined to do it.

我们问加里，什么能给予他的生活的最大的目标和意义？他无法给出与工作相关的答案。一旦我们开启了对未来生活假设，他立刻答道：“给孩子们当教练。”他说，自己虽然很遗憾没能辅导女儿，但可以通过这种方式回馈社会，充实生活。他家附近刚好有一所寄养之家，专门收留孤儿和父母无法继续监护的孩子，加里每天上班都会经过那里，但几乎从未关注过它。现在他决定尝试为它服务。这家机构恰好在招聘男篮教练，每周需要抽出3个晚上指导球队，而且比赛时间大多集中在周六。但是加里还是决心一试。

His obvious skill as a player won him instant respect, but it was his nurturing style that eventually won the hearts of the kids on the team. Gary was sixteen when his own father died, and his high school basketball coach’s steadfast encouragement and support, even when Gary’s play fell off dramatically, had been deeply meaningful to him. The kids he was now coaching had even more harrowing stories to tell—of being abandoned, beaten, abused—and Gary saw a way to use basketball to build both their self-confidence and their connections with each other.

加里突出的篮球技能很快就得到大家的认可，但最终为他赢得孩子们爱戴的是他的教育方式。加里的父亲去世时他才16岁，即便他的场上表现一塌糊涂，高中时的篮球教练还是一如既往地鼓励他、支持他，这对他产生了深远的影响。而加里现在指导的孩子们则有更为不幸的过去——抛弃、暴力和虐待，他决心用篮球帮助他们建立自信，架起与外界沟通的桥梁。

It didn’t happen quickly. Gary spent the first several weeks of practice breaking up fights and trying with limited success to get the kids to keep their attention on practice. The team lost its first three games, and Gary had to throw one of the most talented players off the team after he physically assaulted a teammate. But Gary’s patience and persistence eventually bore fruit. The team began to win its share of games, but even more than that, they began to genuinely work together as a team. For Gary, the rewards were immense. He loved coaching and he loved the kids. The exhilaration he felt spilled over into the rest of his life. For the first time in years, he felt alive and connected.

成功并没有很快出现。最初几周的训练课程里，加里花了大把时间把打架的队员拉开，徒劳无功地让孩子们把注意力集中在训练上。篮球队输掉了前3场比赛，然后加里又不得不把一位好手开除出篮球队，因为他无端攻击了另一位队友。加里的耐心和坚持最终获得了回报。篮球队开始赢比赛，更重要的是，他们开始作为团队协同合作。这一点对加里来说意义重大。他喜欢做篮球教练，也喜欢孩子们。这股兴奋渗入了生活的各个方面，多年来他头一次感到自己充满活力，意志充实。

Three months after he first visited us—a month into his coaching—it dawned on Gary that there was an obvious parallel opportunity at work: serving as a mentor to the younger people who worked for him. The company had never rewarded nor given much priority to this role—or to leadership generally—but to Gary the analogies to coaching suddenly seemed obvious. Here was another chance to make a real difference. He launched a ritual around spending time away from work with the young traders in his department. His interest was not so much in improving their technical skills as it was in helping them to manage their careers and sort out their priorities, both at work and in the rest of their lives.

与我们合作3个月之后——也就是加入篮球队1个月后，加里意识到，自己在工作中同样可以扮演导师的角色，为年轻人提供指导。尽管公司对他的要求并没有明确加入导师一项，加里还是认为这个决定是顺理成章的，可能会为他人带来改变一生的机会。他开始与年轻交易员们进行工作以外的交流，并非为了提升他们的职业技能，而是指导他们规划职业生涯，分清工作和生活中的轻重缓急。

This proved especially significant as the stock market began to melt down. Gary’s steadiness in the face of the downturn and his refusal to panic proved to be invaluable to many of his traders. He spent many breakfasts and lunches simply listening to them. In addition to offering counsel on how to navigate a difficult environment—and serving as a role model—he helped them to see that their self-worth didn’t have to rise and fall with the market. Several of them even followed his lead and volunteered at different social service organizations. One actually became his assistant coach.

在股票市场开始急转直下时，这点变得尤为重要。面对低迷市场，加里镇静如常，安抚了许多交易员的心。他用很多早餐和午餐的时机倾听他们的想法。除了用亲身体会教年轻人如何渡过困境，他还让他们认识到，自我价值不会随着市场情况而改变。人们甚至效仿他，加入社会团体，提供志愿服务，还有人当上了他的篮球队的副教练。

Demanding as it was to take time for his traders amid the pressures of a difficult market, Gary found it both rewarding and energizing. For the first time in two years, he started to look forward to coming to work, and to feel a sense of mission. The rewards that he derived from his mentoring—both at work and with his basketball team—gave him back far more energy than he expended.

在市场困境的压力下，时间更显珍贵。可通过与年轻人的交流，加里感受到满足，浑身充满了活力，开始带着使命感走进办公室。他为下属和篮球队付出的努力，最终回报给他意想不到的精力提升。

## “WHAT LIFE EXPECTS FROM US”

Expanding spiritual capacity requires subordinating our own needs to something beyond our self-interest. Because we often perceive our own needs as urgent, shifting attention away from them can prompt very primitive survival fears. If I truly focus my attention on others, we worry, who is going to look out for me? It is a mark of courage to set aside self-interest in order to be of service to others or to a cause. The irony is that self-absorption ultimately drains energy and impedes performance. The more preoccupied we are with our own fears and concerns, the less energy we have available to take positive action.

拓展意志精力需要将自己的需求置于次位，为超出个人利益的目标让路。人们往往认为自身需求迫在眉睫，注意力一旦转移，便会引发原始的生存恐惧。如果我把精力用在别人身上，谁来关照我？但具有讽刺意味的是，自私自利反而会削弱精力，妨碍表现。我们越是被自己的恐惧和担忧掌控，越难调动精力做出正确举措。

Subordinating our self-interest to something beyond ourselves may feel threatening at first, but as Gary discovered, it can also be immensely rewarding—a means by which to experience a deeper sense of meaning and greater self-worth. The commitment to live according to our deepest values not only creates a more stable center in our lives but also helps us to better navigate the challenges we face along the way.

将个人利益置后起初会让人倍感不安，但加里却认为这样做回报颇丰——提升个人价值、丰富人生意义。深层的价值取向所带来的生活方式不仅是生活的主心骨，还能帮助我们更好地应对各种挑战。

Viktor Frankl has written movingly about the power of spiritual capacity to transform even the most horrifying circumstances. Frankl was the psychologist who survived the Nazi concentration camps and went on to write the classic Man’s Search for Meaning. In it he quotes Nietzsche’s famous words, “He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.” Frankl goes on to describe the way this insight helped to save his own life, even as others were dying around him:

维克多·弗兰克尔（Viktor Frankl）曾动情地总结，意志力量甚至可以扭转最可怕的情况。弗兰克尔是纳粹集中营中幸存的心理学家，他创作了《活出生命的意义》这本经典巨著。书中他引用了尼采的名言：“知晓生命的意义，方能忍耐一切。”弗兰克尔也描述了在不断有人死去的环境中，这个认知如何挽救了他的生命：

> Woe to him who saw no more sense in his life, no aim, no purpose, and therefore no point in carrying on. He was soon lost. What was needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—hourly and daily. Our answer must consist not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answers to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.
>
> 生而没有意义的人是痛苦的，没有目标、没有目的、无需继续忍受。他很快就会迷失。我们的人生态度需要从根本上转变。我们既要自己学着转变，也要向绝望之人伸出援手，告诉他我们对生活的期待其实并不重要，重要的是生活于我们有何期望。我们要停止追问生命的意义所在，每时每刻提醒自己接受生命的检视。我们的回应不仅体现在言语和冥想中，还要贯穿我们的行为举止。生命的终极意义是担起责任，找寻难题的答案，并且完成生命为每个人设定的任务。

As Frankl saw it, we must make our own meaning—actively build spiritual capacity. Doing so necessarily involves discomfort. “Mental health is based on a certain degree of tension,” he wrote, “the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become. . . . What man actually needs is not a tensionless state, but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.”

弗兰克尔认为，我们必须创造出自己生活的意义，即积极拓展意志能力。这样做会毫无疑问地引起不适。“思维健康需要保持一定的张力，它存在于已取得的和未完成的目标之间，存在于个人现状和理想自我的差距……人们需要的并非是毫无紧张感的环境，而是为了自己选择的有价值的目标努力付出。”

Lance Armstrong offers a particularly inspiring example. In the early 1990s, Armstrong was a top American cyclist and by his own description, highly self-absorbed. In 1996, at the age of twenty-five, he was diagnosed with a virulent form of testicular cancer. In a short time, it spread to his lungs, and then to his brain. His odds of survival were put at less than 3 percent. Somehow Armstrong survived and, equally miraculously, he returned to cycling. In 1999, three years after his original cancer diagnosis, he won the Tour de France, the most challenging bicycle race in the world—and he went on to win it the next three years as well. As Armstrong saw it, surviving cancer was a far greater and more significant achievement—in large part because it pushed him beyond his own narrow ambitions:

兰斯·阿姆斯特朗是一个鼓舞人心的榜样。 90年代初期，阿姆斯特朗已经成为美国顶级的自行车运动员，用他自己的话说，那时的他“只顾自己”。 1996年， 25岁的阿姆斯特朗被诊断出患有致命的睾丸癌，并迅速扩散到肺部和大脑。医生估计他只有3%的康复概率。然而阿姆斯特朗奇迹般地活了下来，并重新回到了赛场。 1999年，也就是在诊断出癌症3年之后，他在环法自行车大赛中获得总冠军，并且连续七年拔得头筹。在阿姆斯特朗看来，战胜癌症是一项比冠军更重大的成就——带他走出了狭隘的人生意义：

> The truth is that if you asked me to choose between winning the Tour de France and cancer, I would choose cancer. Odd as it sounds, I would rather have the title of cancer survivor than winner of the tour, because of what it has done for me as a human being, a man, a husband, a son and a father. . . . The one thing the illness has convinced me of beyond all doubt—more than any experience I’ve had as an athlete—is that we are much better than we know. We have unrealized capacities that sometimes only emerge in crisis. So if there is a purpose to the suffering that is cancer, I think it must be this: it’s meant to improve us.
>
> 如果你让我在赢得环法大赛和战胜癌症之间做选择，我会选择战胜癌症。虽然听上去不可思议，但在我看来癌症生还者比环法大赛冠军的头衔更有意义，因为癌症我重新认识了自己作为男人、丈夫、儿子和父亲的角色……病魔教会了我一件事——我的运动员生涯从未告诉我，我们比自己想象的要坚强得多。每个人都拥有许多未知的潜力，只能在困境中才会激发它们。如果癌症的折磨具有意义，那一定是让我们变成更好的自己。

## VALUING OTHERS

Barry F. was the CEO of a large information services company, and he thought of himself as a benevolent boss who treated his employees well. Nonetheless, one of the most consistent pieces of feedback he got from his direct reports was that he persistently kept them waiting and seemed not to value their time. This was a criticism, he acknowledged, that he had received for many years, and he couldn’t deny its truth. Unfortunately, he told us, there was nothing he could do about it. Barry’s daily schedule as CEO was packed. He never purposely kept anyone waiting, but calls and other demands piled up and he didn’t express much hope of changing his behavior.

巴里是一家大型信息服务公司的首席执行官，他自视是个和善的老板，对员工非常好。然而直接下属给出的最多反馈说是他总是让他们等待，不尊重他们的时间。他承认自己一直都收到这样的评价，他们说得没错，但他也无能为力。作为首席执行官他的日程很满，他也不是故意让别人等待，可是总有各种电话和突发事件，他觉得改变的希望非常渺茫。

That perception changed dramatically during our work on identifying the values that Barry held most dear. He was unequivocal in identifying the number one value in his life: respect for others. Both of his parents had modeled this behavior and he spoke about it with great conviction.

当我们询问巴里最重视的价值取向时，这个看法有了改变。他毫不含糊地说，最重要的价值观是尊重他人。他的父母都是尊重他人的楷模，他也很确信自己也是一样。

“How then,” we asked, “does respect for others square with keeping people waiting?”

“既然这样，”我们问道，“让别人等待是否符合尊重他人的定义？”

There was a long silence. “It doesn’t,” he said finally.

我们得到的是一段长久的静默。“的确不符合。”他最终说道。

When it came time to create Barry’s action plan, respecting people’s time became one of his primary commitments. When we spoke to Barry several months later, he told us that keeping on schedule had been difficult at first. He worried that he would antagonize the chairman of his company, members of his own board and key clients if he tried to end meetings with them at a specific time. What made it possible was reconnecting to the value he placed on respect for others. “The first thing I did was get more focused about covering my agenda in the time allotted,” he explained. “In cases where time begins to run out and we still aren’t finished, I now simply stop and explain that I am very sorry, but that I have made it a policy not to keep people waiting and that we’ll have to schedule more time later. What I found is that it seems to make even the people I am meeting with feel more respected. It also makes them much more efficient about getting through their agendas.” Simply acknowledging how important he felt it was to respect others gave Barry the determination to make a change that had eluded him for years.

所以我们在帮助巴里制订行为规范时，尊重他人的时间摆在了首要位置。几个月后我们回访巴里，他告诉我们，最初严格遵守日程非常困难。他担心按时结束会议的举动会惹恼公司主席、董事会和重要客户。但考虑到尊重他人的原则，他必须执行下去。“我首先会尽力在计划时间内集中精力完成所有议程，如果时间到了会议还没有结束，我会停下来对大家说抱歉，但我不能让别人干等，所以未完成的议题只有下次开会继续讨论。我发现这样做之后，即使是参加会议的人也感觉受到尊重，开会变得更加高效。”仅仅是重新认识到尊重他人在自己心中的价值，巴里就能够下决心做出改变，解决困扰他多年的问题。

## JEREMY G.: INDECISIVE, CONFLICT-AVOIDANT

At thirty-seven, Jeremy G. worked as the business manager for the Internet division of a large consumer company committed to selling more of its products through the Web. Brilliant at creating deal structures and working creatively with numbers, Jeremy was charged with helping the company build a Web presence quickly while minimizing the company’s financial exposure. By his own view and that of his colleagues, his primary performance barrier was his difficulty in taking a strong stand and his discomfort with conflict.

37岁的杰里米是一家大型消费品公司互联网部门的商务经理，工作内容是通过网络销售更多的商品。他擅长设计交易结构和数字处理，很快就帮助公司建起网站，降低了公司的财务风险。在自己和其他同事眼中，他的主要表现障碍是立场不坚定，害怕与他人冲突。

Jeremy told us that he simply felt more comfortable when people got along, and that he preferred not to make waves. He resisted the suggestion that he told people what he thought they wanted to hear, but he acknowledged that it was very important to him to be well liked. He was so attuned to how others were feeling—about him and about whatever issue was on the table—that he often found it hard to identify what he really felt himself. On the one hand, this made him an empathic listener and an easy person to be around. On the other hand, it made him passive and indecisive, which had long since prompted his colleagues to stop looking to him for insight. Rather than being a significant voice in strategy discussions, he served largely as the person who ran the numbers.

杰里米告诉我们，他更喜欢大家一团和气，不愿意引起争端。他不愿意承认自己总是说别人爱听的话，但讨人喜欢对他来说确实非常重要。他关注别人对他的看法、对事情的看法，却不清楚自己的感受。这使得他成为一个具有同情心的倾听者，容易相处；同时也令他地位被动、优柔寡断，导致同事不再向他寻求意见。他并不是战略讨论中的重要声音，只是个默默无闻的数字处理员。

It never occurred to Jeremy that the obstacle he faced was primarily spiritual and that what he lacked was access to the focused energy that comes from connecting to one’s deepest values. His challenge, we suggested, was to shift his orientation from placating his bosses and worrying so much about what they thought about him to trusting his own voice and taking clear stands based on their merits. That didn’t mean he had to be confrontational or antagonizing. He could still treat others with respect while holding his own ground.

杰里米从未发觉，他的表现障碍主要是精神层面的，缺乏与深层价值取向的沟通。我们建议他，注意力的重点不要放在安抚上司、担心他们对他的看法上，而是要相信自己的声音、明确表达立场。这并不意味着他要变得激进好斗、与人为敌，而是在尊重他人的同时坚守自己的立场。

When it came to creating an appropriate ritual, we suggested that Jeremy begin by building mental preparation time into every morning. Doing so would give him a chance to rehearse his remarks before prospective meetings, and to visualize his suggestions being accepted and valued. From our work with athletes we learned that visualizing a performance challenge in advance is a very effective way to allay anxiety and to perform without awkwardness or self-consciousness. Jeremy also decided to set aside time before meetings to research the subject to be discussed, in order to be fully informed even about issues outside his expertise.

至于改变的方法，我们建议杰里米每天早晨进行心理建设，在会议之前排练自己的发言，想象自己的意见被大家肯定和接受的场景。从我们与运动员的合作经验来看，在思维中提前预演可以有效缓解焦虑，不被自我意识或尴尬的念头干扰。杰里米还决定在开会之前预习议题，确保对讨论内容有全面的了解。

The third dimension of Jeremy’s ritual was designed for the meetings themselves. As issues arose, he asked himself a simple question “What do I really believe here?” and then tried to listen for his instinctive response. Doing so, he found, helped him avoid being distracted by other points of view. If he found himself agreeing with a point of view too readily, he asked himself a second question: “Who am I trying to please here?” It proved to be a highly effective way for Jeremy to ensure that he was speaking from a place of conviction.

第三个步骤专为会议打造。与别人出现分歧时，他首先要问问自己：“我的真实想法是什么？”倾听自己的直觉答案，使他不被别人的意见左右。如果他发现自己太急于赞成某个观点，就要提出第二个问题：“我想取悦谁？”结果，这一方法有效确保他从客观的角度进行发言。

## LINDA P.: LACK OF FOLLOW-THROUGH, UNRELIABILITY

Linda P. was an executive in charge of buyers for a large department store chain. She had a dozen people reporting directly to her, and two hundred people in her division. Linda came to see us largely because she felt overwhelmed by her job and unable to create any sense of balance in her life. Married with an eight-year-old daughter, she worked most nights until 8:00 P.M., and often until 9 P.M. Her husband was self-employed, had a much more flexible schedule, and was effectively the primary parent. Linda didn’t worry about her daughter’s well-being, but she felt bereft about not seeing more of her. At work, meanwhile, she sensed a growing morale problem with her direct reports that baffled her.

琳达是一家大型连锁百货公司的采购部主管，她有十几名直接下属，部门人员多达200人。琳达找到我们，觉得生活失衡，被工作压得喘不过气来。尽管已婚并有一个8岁的女儿，多数时间她还是会工作到晚上8点，有时9点。她的丈夫做个体生意，时间要灵活得多，也是对女儿更尽责的一个。琳达并不担忧女儿的衣食，却失落于自己不能常常见到她。同时，她察觉到直接下属中存在着越来越严重的士气问题，却一时束手无策。

Linda thought of herself as a model of integrity—someone who was trustworthy, fair, straightforward and caring. She took pride in trying always to do the right thing. She was stunned, therefore, to discover that the primary performance barrier cited by colleagues on her Full Engagement Inventory was that she was unreliable and couldn’t be counted on to live up to her commitments.

琳达把自己看作正直的典范，值得信任，待人公平，坦诚又乐于助人，总是选择做正确的事情。当同事们在调查问卷上指出她不可靠且言而无信时，她的讶异可想而知。

We define integrity—a key ingredient in character and a primary spiritual muscle—as doing what you say you are going to do when you say you are going to do it. By this measure, Linda was perceived to fall considerably short. The key decisions for the department flowed through her, and her colleagues reported that she constantly made promises about getting work done that she failed to keep. Because Linda was so personally well liked and because her direct reports were aware how busy she was and how hard she worked, they were reluctant to hold her accountable. The result was that projects got backed up, leaving the people who worked for her feeling both frustrated and disempowered.

这里我们首先定义一下正直的概念——一种言出必行的重要品格和美德。依此标准来看，琳达的确没有做到。部门的关键决策都需要她拍板，同事们说她总是保证要完成某事，结果往往食言。因为琳达本人很受欢迎，下属们也知道她事务繁忙、工作努力，因而他们都不愿把责任丢给她，结果导致项目延期，部门员工都倍感挫败，无精打采。

At first, Linda serenaded us with rationalizations: “I am incredibly busy, and I do the jobs of three people,” and “I never make a promise that I don’t intend to keep,” and “I eventually get it all done, and when I don’t, it’s because the project really didn’t merit a high priority in the first place.” None of these explanations was likely to make the people who worked for her feel better, we pointed out, nor to solve the logjams she was creating. The simple truth was that Linda overestimated her capacity to efficiently meet the demands that she took on. That was what kept her at work late, left her feeling exhausted, and undermined her sense of connection with her family.

起初琳达试图向我们解释：“我真的很忙，一个人要做三个人的工作，”还有“如果我不打算遵守承诺，从最开始就不会保证”，以及“我最终都会完成，如果没完成，那是因为这些事情本身就不太重要”。我们指出，这些解释都不足以安抚她的下属，也无益于解决现在的僵局。真相其实很简单，琳达高估了自己的做事能力。这也是她工作到很晚的原因，使得丈夫承担了大部分家庭责任，也损害了她与家人的关系。

> 将承诺放入待办事项，并规定完成日期

As Linda tried to understand her own behavior better, she began to realize that it stemmed from a strong need for control and an unwillingness to trust others and to delegate. The fact that the people who worked for her felt resentful and frustrated was something that Linda found unacceptable. It was especially intolerable to think of herself as lacking integrity—a value that she put near the top of her list.

琳达剖析了自己的行为，意识到她的问题其实来源于控制欲，不信任他人，不愿放权。部门员工的埋怨和不满让琳达难以接受，评价她缺乏正直更让她不能忍受，毕竟这是她最重要的价值观之一。

Linda created a simple ritual around commitment. Aware that her impulse was to take on every project put before her, she decided to institute a more structured, deliberate way of making such decisions. When any new challenge arose, she paused and asked herself two key questions. The first was “Is this something I need to do myself?” If her answer was yes, the second question was: “When does it need to be finished, and can I reasonably get it done by then?” If she had any doubt, she checked her calendar, and if she decided to take it on, she made an immediate addition to her to-do list, including a promised completion date.

琳达改变了自己随意承诺的习惯。她清楚自己总想承接所有摆在面前的工作，于是决定用一种更理智、更慎重的态度来选择。新任务出现时，她首先问自己：“这件事需要我亲自来做吗？”如果答案是肯定的，再问自己第二个问题：“什么时间必须完成，我有没有能力遵守？”如果她心存疑问，就会先对照自己的日程表；如果她接下工作，立刻把它加入待办事项，并写出明确的截止期限。

“When I tell someone that I am going to do something, I make an absolute commitment, and I repeat it out loud,” Linda told us later. “Very quickly I stopped making so many promises. I got better about prioritizing my time, and I began to delegate more of my responsibilities.”

“如果我告诉别人我要做什么事情，就等于许下了承诺，还会大声重复它。”琳达后来告诉我们。“我很快就不再轻易许诺了。时间变得充裕起来，因为我开始学会把工作分给其他人去做。”

Giving up a certain amount of control raised difficult issues for Linda, and she continued to struggle with the feeling that if she didn’t oversee key activities herself, they wouldn’t get done right. At times, feeling frustrated, she took the job back into her own hands. Ultimately, however, she devised a solution to this impulse that was largely successful. She simply established very clear standards and objectives and held people accountable to them. Rather than take over a job herself when she wasn’t satisfied with the result, she began giving it back to the responsible person to fix. Two very different kind of outcomes ensued. Two of her direct reports could not meet her standards, no matter how many times she sent jobs back. It finally dawned on her that they were the wrong people for their jobs and that she had been avoiding seeing this truth by taking over their work.

放弃一部分控制权对琳达来说并不容易，她感觉如果不亲自监督重要活动，别人会做不好。有些情况下，她还是会变得沮丧，把事情收回自己手里。但是她最终找到了解决办法。她只负责提出明确的目标和要求，把责任分给他人。若不满意最终成果，她会找来负责人补救，而不是自己动手修整。在此过程中，有两位下属无论被返回多少次，始终不能达到她的要求，她终于意识到他们不适合这样的工作，而自己以前宁愿替他们完成工作也不愿面对事实。

Linda decided to let one of the executives go and encouraged him to find work that better suited his talents. The other executive she reassigned to a job she believed was a far better fit. Sure enough, the executive began to excel. As for Linda’s other direct reports, most of them palpably rose to the challenge of taking more responsibility and demonstrating a level of skill, creativity and initiative that exceeded - Linda’s expectations. “The truth is that my beginning to let go changed the atmosphere in my group,” Linda told us. “People took much more ownership, the quality of our work improved, and I began leaving a lot earlier most nights.”

琳达决定解雇其中一人，鼓励他寻找与能力相符的工作；将另一个人指派到她认为更适合他的项目上，结果他很快就崭露头角。至于其他下属，大多数都承担起了更多的责任，并展现了超出她预想的才能、创意和主动性。“事实上，我的放手改变了整个团队的氛围，”琳达说，“员工有了更多的掌控权，工作质量都提高了，大多数时候，我每天的下班时间也提早了。”

## MICHAEL D.: LACK OF TRUTHFULNESS, EXAGGERATION

If integrity has to do with reliably living up to our commitments, honesty is about telling the truth, to ourselves and to others. Both are key spiritual muscles. Michael D. is an investment adviser at a financial services company. He was sent to us by his boss late in 1999, along with other advisers in his division. Michael was annoyed to be pulled away from work for three days and skeptical that our program would be of much use to him. A top performer, he earned a very good income and rated himself very highly in nearly every category of our Full Engagement Inventory. Much of the feedback that he received from colleagues was likewise positive. Most rated him as highly focused, organized, friendly, optimistic and even-tempered.

如果正直是关于遵守承诺，诚实则是对自己和他人说真话。二者都是精神肌肉的重要组成部分。迈克尔是一家金融服务公司的投资顾问， 1999年下半年他的老板把他和其他顾问送到我们这里培训。迈克尔很不乐意占用3天的工作时间，对培训效果也非常怀疑。他是部门的骨干员工，收入良好，自评问卷几乎每一项都打了高分。同事们对他的反馈也很正面，大家评价他做事专注、有条理，亲切友好，积极向上，脾气温和。

The one area in which Michael received consistently low ratings was trustworthiness. He didn’t find this entirely surprising, but it annoyed him. “They don’t get it,” he told us. “I’m much more honest about myself than they are. I admit who I am. I’m a salesman. I’m a promoter and a storyteller. My job is to get people excited about my products, to create positive spin. I don’t sell stocks and bonds, I sell hope and promise. If I was a stickler with the facts, I’d never sell anything.” He took a similar view about competing for clients. “People in the office will tell you I’m manipulative and tricky. The truth is I’m very straightforward. I do what it takes to get clients, and then I do very well for them.”

迈克尔得到低迷评价的一项是“可信任度”。虽然他对此并不惊讶，却还是心生不快。“他们不明白，”他告诉我们，“我可比他们诚实多了，我承认自己的为人。我是销售员，要做推广就要善于讲故事。我的能力就是让大家对产品产生渴望，打造正面影响。我卖的不是股票和债券，而是希望和承诺。如果我只说事实，就什么也卖不出去。”他对于办公室里的竞争也有类似的看法。“办公室里的人会告诉你们我喜欢操控别人，爱耍花招。实际上我是很直接的人。我会尽我所能拉近客户，然后为他们做好事情。”

Michael had built a very successful practice through the 1990s based on his willingness to make big, bold bets, especially on technology stocks, with the wind of a bull market behind him. As far as Michael was concerned, his continuing success was his best defense. “I deliver the goods,” he said, and he found very little of our program useful beyond the information about how to expand his physical capacity. Six months later, in mid-2000, Michael returned to us with his fellow financial advisers for the second stage of our training. At first, we were surprised to see him at all. It turned out that he was in a very different place. Three months earlier, the dot com crash had begun, and the stock market—most notably the NASDAQ—had dropped precipitously.

迈克尔在整个90年代业绩斐然，因为他下注大胆，在科技股方面尤其敏锐，更不用说借上了整个牛市的东风。迈克尔认为，他的成功就是最好的证据。“我做到了。”他说，并且批评我们的培训除了体能拓展技巧之外毫无用处。 6个月之后，即2000年的年中，迈克尔和其他投资顾问来到我们公司进行第二阶段的培训。起初，我们很惊讶会再次看到他，后来才知道他的情况已今非昔比。 3个月前网络板块开始崩盘，股票市场——主要是纳斯达克——一落千丈。

When technology stocks went into freefall, several of Michael’s biggest bets plummeted in value. His own portfolio took a beating and so did his performance for his clients. The experience was both humbling and sobering, and it caused Michael to do some soul searching. He had, he realized, gotten caught up in his own hype, allowing himself to believe that the future was limitless. As the market plummeted, he was forced to step back and take time to reflect. He found that he could no longer kid himself. It had been the Emperor’s new clothes all along, he concluded, and he was convinced that the market was headed significantly further down.

随着科技股进入自由落体，迈克尔几笔最大的投注价值暴跌。自己的投资组合受到打击，他对客户的服务也打了折扣。这段经历磨平了他的锐气，也让他逐渐清醒，开始探索内心。他意识到，他也被自己的大肆鼓吹所迷惑，相信未来无限光明。当市场受到重创，他也被迫退后反思，发现不能再自欺欺人。他总结说，一直以来不过是穿着新装的皇帝。最关键的是，他认为市场还会继续下滑。

Michael spent a good deal of his time during his second visit wrestling with the issue of how to proceed with his clients. So long as he was making a lot of money for himself and for them, Michael didn’t worry much about overstating or exaggerating or shaving the truth here and there. The fact that his clients were now suffering by virtue of his recommendations made him feel deeply uneasy. In the end, he decided that he didn’t feel comfortable encouraging them to hold on, much less to make new investments in the market. Telling the truth—at least the truth as he now saw it—seemed like the only way to stop the damage and to feel comfortable with himself, even if that meant losing clients.

在第二次到访中，迈克尔花了许多时间思考如何与客户继续合作。曾几何时，只要能为客户赚钱并填满自己的荷包，他并不介意言过其实或刻意隐瞒。现在，客户因为他的推荐蒙受损失，这让他十分不好受。最后，他无法继续鼓励他们坚持下去，更无法劝说他们继续往投资。说出事实——至少是他知道的事实——看上去是唯一可以制止损失、安抚良心的做法，即便这意味着可能会失去客户。

Specifically, Michael decided to sell a significant percentage of his holdings and take the losses, and to maintain a large cash position for the near term. He also resolved to speak personally with each of his clients to explain his decision, and to try to address their concerns as honestly as he could. Finally, he launched a very simple ritual to address the issue of trustworthiness. His instinct for exaggeration was so great that he often did it reflexively—doubling a projected number, or overstating the progress of a deal, or simply dressing up his comments with superlatives. The ritual that he introduced addressed accountability. Whenever Michael made a statement to a client or to a colleague, he determined to take a moment afterward to monitor his own accuracy. He was amazed to discover how frequently inaccurate information seemed to emerge from his lips. It made him feel like Jim Carrey in Liar, Liar.

迈克尔决定卖出相当一部分股票，承担损失，以保证近期的现金储备。他也打算私下向客户们解释他的决定，并且尽可能诚实地回应他们的担忧。在改变行为方面，言过其实的冲动太过强烈，几乎变成了条件反射——把预估的数字翻一番，夸大交易的进度，或者在评价中使用最高级词汇。所以迈克尔决定，如果向客户或同事做陈述，过后都要自查言语的准确度。当他意识到自己随口说出了多少不准确的信息，感觉自己变成了《大话王》的主角。

Michael’s second commitment was to correct himself as quickly as possible when he caught himself exaggerating, no matter how embarrassing that might be. He was relieved to discover that increasing his awareness and holding himself accountable had a huge impact on his behavior. After correcting himself a half-dozen times during the first couple of weeks of his ritual, he found that he was able to catch himself in most instances before he actually said something inaccurate. Within a month, speaking the truth had become more reflexive.

迈克尔第二个承诺是一旦发现自己夸大其词就立刻纠正，不论自己的处境会变得多么尴尬。令他欣慰的是，有意承担责任给他的行为带来了正面影响。几周后，经过数次脱口后又自我纠正的尴尬，他已经能在大多数场合夸大其词之前就控制住自己。一个月后，讲真话变得更自然了。

A few of Michael’s clients did decide to move their business elsewhere, but the overwhelming majority stayed put. Michael’s earnings diminished significantly and so, for a time, did his reputation in his firm. But over the course of the next eighteen months, the value of the stocks that he had sold early in 2000 continued to decline precipitously, along with the rest of the market. Many of his fellow investment advisers suffered huge losses, for themselves and their clients, while - Michael’s conservative portfolio held its own. His relationships with his clients grew closer. Many of them felt deeply appreciative that his decision had saved them from far more considerable losses, and they were also moved by his concern for their welfare. By mid-2001, Michael’s client list had actually grown, largely from referrals, and his passion for what he was doing was higher than it had been at the height of the bull market. For the first time, he felt that he was genuinely serving clients rather than simply trying to maximize his earnings.

的确有一部分迈克尔的客户决定撤走交易，但绝大多数还是留了下来。迈克尔的收入严重蒸发，在公司的名声也一落千丈。但在接下来一年半里，之前他赔本卖掉的股票持续暴跌，整个市场继续走低，其他同行和他们的客户都蒙受了巨额损失，迈克尔的保守被证明是明智的。他与客户的关系更加紧密，许多人都很感激他挽救了他们的财产，阻止了更加糟糕的情况，也被他真切的关心打动。到了2001年中，迈克尔的客户数量不降反升，很多都是现有的客户介绍的，他的工作热情甚至超出了牛市时的最高水平。他头一次感觉到自己在为客户服务，而不是只顾扩大自己的利益。
