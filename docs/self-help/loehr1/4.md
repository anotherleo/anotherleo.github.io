# Physical Energy: Fueling the Fire

The importance of physical energy seems obvious for athletes, construction workers and farmers. Because the rest of us are evaluated more by what we do with our minds than with our bodies, we tend to discount the role that physical energy plays in performance. In most jobs, the physical body has been completely cut off from the performance equation. In reality, physical energy is the fundamental source of fuel, even if our work is almost completely sedentary. It not only lies at the heart of alertness and vitality but also affects our ability to manage our emotions, sustain concentration, think creatively, and even maintain our commitment to whatever mission we are on. Leaders and managers make a fundamental mistake when they assume that they can overlook the physical dimension of energy and still expect those who work for them to perform at their best.

体能的重要性对运动员、建筑工人和农民来说不言自明。因为其他职业更看重思维劳动，所以人们容易低估体能在效能中扮演的角色。在大多数工作中，体能被完全从效能公式中抹去，然而实际操作中，体能是燃料的基本来源，即使大部分工作时间都是坐着一动不动。它不仅是敏锐度和生命力的核心，还影响着我们管理情绪、保持专注、创新思考甚至投入工作的能力。领导者和经理们往往会犯基本的错误，忽略精力对体能的需求，却仍然期望下属随时保持最佳表现。

At the time we met Roger B., he had never thought much about managing his energy in any part of his life, and he gave virtually no attention to the physical dimension. He realized that he would probably feel better if he got more sleep and exercised regularly, but the way he saw it, he simply didn’t have the time. He knew that his diet wasn’t very healthy, but he couldn’t summon much motivation to change. Instead, he tried not to think about the consequences of his choices. Mostly what Roger felt was busy—and numb.

当我们遇到罗杰的时候，他从未想过管理任何方面的精力，对体能更不屑一顾。他也意识到，如果睡眠充足、定期锻炼，身体可能会舒适些，但按他的话来讲，他就是没有时间来睡眠和锻炼。他知道自己的饮食习惯称不上健康，但也没什么动机做出改变。他只是不让自己思考饥一顿饱一顿带来的后果。大部分时间，罗杰能感受到的只有忙碌和麻木。

At the most basic level, physical energy is derived from the interaction between oxygen and glucose. In practical terms, the size of our energy reservoir depends on the patterns of our breathing, the foods that we eat and when we eat them, the quantity and quality of our sleep, the degree to which we get intermittent recovery during the day, and the level of our fitness. Building a rhythmic balance between physical energy expenditure and recovery insures that the level of our energy reserves remains relatively constant. Pushing past our comfort zone—and then recovering—is a means by which to expand physical capacity wherever it is insufficient to meet demand.

从生理学的角度看，精力来源于氧气和血糖的化学反应。从实际生活来看，精力储备取决于我们的呼吸模式、进食的内容和时间、睡眠的长短和质量、白天间歇恢复的程度以及身体的健康程度。建立起体能消耗和恢复的节奏性平衡，能够确保精力储备保持在相对稳定的水平。走出舒适区，然后等待恢复，则是拓展体力的方法，适用于体力无法满足要求的情况。

The most important rhythms in our lives are the ones we typically take for granted—most notably breathing and eating. Few of us even think about breathing. Oxygen becomes precious only in those rare instances when we can’t get enough—choking on a piece of food, getting caught in an ocean undertow, or suffering from a disease such as emphysema. Even significant changes in our pattern of breathing tend to go unnoticed. Anxiety and anger, for example, typically prompt faster and shallower breathing, which can be valuable in responding to an immediate threat. Very quickly, however, such a breathing pattern reduces our available energy and compromises our ability to restore mental and emotional equilibrium. The result can be a cycle that reinforces itself, which explains why one of the simplest antidotes to anger and anxiety is to take deep abdominal breaths.

生命中最重要的节奏常常被我们视为理所当然，尤其是呼吸和进食。但是几乎没有人会思考呼吸相关的事情。氧气只有在缺氧时才显得弥足珍贵——被食物噎住，被海面下的暗流困住，或者患上肺气肿之类的疾病时。呼吸模式即使发生了重大改变，也很少引起人们的警觉。焦虑或生气时呼吸会变得浅而急促，这种模式在我们受到即时威胁时会帮上大忙，然而它会迅速燃烧精力储备，损害我们重塑思维和平复情感的能力，诱发恶性循环。这也解释了为什么应对愤怒和焦虑最简单的方法就是用腹式呼吸。

The breath is a powerful tool for self-regulation—a means both to summon energy and to relax deeply. Extending the exhalation, for example, prompts a powerful wave of recovery. Breathing in to a count of three and out to a count of six, lowers arousal and quiets not just the body but also the mind and the emotions. Deep, smooth and rhythmic breathing is simultaneously a source of energy, alertness and focus as well as of relaxation, stillness and quiet—the ultimate healthy pulse.

呼吸是自律的有力工具，既能集聚精力，又能带来深度放松。延长呼气时间有利于精力恢复。三次一组吸气、六次一组呼气可以使体能、思维和情感平复下来。深度、平静、有节奏地呼吸会激发精力、敏锐和专注，也能带来放松、宁静和安宁。这就是健康的终极脉动。

## STRATEGIC EATING

The second critical source of physical energy in our lives comes from the foods we eat. The costs of not eating enough—renewing energy with food that gets converted into glycogen—are clear. Most of us have not had much experience with prolonged hunger, but we all know the visceral feeling of being hungry and its impact on our ability to function effectively at all levels. On an empty stomach, it is difficult to be concerned with much besides food. Chronic overeating, on the other hand, represents too much “recovery,” leads to obesity and compromised energy, and has both performance and health consequences. Foods high in fats, sugar and simple carbohydrates provide recovery, but in a much less efficient and energy-rich form than low-fat proteins and complex carbohydrates such as vegetables and grains.

体力的第二个重要来源是食物。进食不足的代价——不能从食物中摄取足够的糖原转化为能量——是明显的。大多数人都没有体验过长期饥饿，但我们都清楚饥肠辘辘的感觉，以及它对我们各方面能力有效功能发挥的影响。饥饿的情况下，除食物之外很难有其他事物能吸引注意力。另外，长期过度进食则是过度“恢复”的典型代表，导致身体肥胖，损害精力。高糖高脂的食物和简单碳水化合物可以产生精力，但它们与低脂蛋白和蔬菜谷物等复合碳水化合物相比，不仅转化效率低，释放的能量也不如后者丰富。

Eating better obviously has benefits in and of itself, including losing weight, looking better and improving health, all of which may have positive energy consequences. Our primary aim is to help clients sustain a steady, high-octane source of energy throughout the day. When you awake in the mornings, after eight to twelve hours without eating, your blood glucose levels are at a low ebb, even if you don’t feel consciously hungry. Eating breakfast is critically important. It not only increases blood glucose levels, but also jump-starts metabolism.

吃得好显然有很多益处，包括减重、外形漂亮和促进健康，带来积极精力。我们的首要目标之一，就是帮助客户全天保持稳定、高质的精力。早晨起床时， 8～12个小时没有进食，即使你并不感到饥饿，血糖水平也在衰退，这时早餐就显得尤为重要，它不仅能提高血糖水平，还能强力推动机体新陈代谢。

It is equally important to eat foods that are low on the glycemic index, which measures the speed with which sugar from specific foods is released into the bloodstream. (See Glycemic Index Examples in Resources.) A slower release provides a steadier source of energy. The low-glycemic breakfast foods that provide the highest octane and longest lasting source of energy, for example, include whole grains, proteins and low-glycemic fruits such as strawberries, pears, grapefruit and apples. By contrast, high-glycemic foods such as muffins or sugary cereals spike energy for short periods but prompt a crash in as few as thirty minutes. Even a breakfast traditionally viewed as healthy—an unbuttered bagel and a glass of orange juice—is very high on the glycemic index and therefore a poor source of sustaining energy.

选择升糖指数低的食物同样重要。升糖指数用以测量糖分从食物进入血液的速度（详见《实用资料》中食品升糖指数举例）。缓慢释放的糖分能够提供更稳定的精力。一顿低升糖指数的早餐可以提供高效并持久的精力，例如全麦食物、蛋白质和低糖水果——草莓、梨子和苹果等。相反，高升糖指数的食物如松饼和甜麦片短期内可以激发精力，但30分钟后精力水平就会显著下降。即使是传统意义上的健康早餐——不涂黄油的面包圈和一杯橙汁——升糖指数也很高，不能帮助人们较好地维持精力。

The frequency with which we eat also influences our capacity to stay fully engaged and to sustain high performance. Eating five to six low calorie, highly nutritious “meals” a day insures a steady resupply of energy. Even the most energy rich foods won’t fuel high performance for the four to eight hours that many of us frequently permit to pass between meals. In one study at New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital, subjects were placed in an environment with no clocks or time cues. Provided with food, they were told to eat whenever they were hungry. They did so an average of once every ninety-six minutes.

我们进食的频率也会影响保持全情投入的能力和维持最佳表现的能力。一天内吃五至六餐低热量而高营养的食物能够供应稳定的精力，因为即使精力最丰富的食物也不足以支持4～8小时的高效表现，但这是我们许多人的两餐间隔时间。纽约西奈山医院的一项实验中，受试者被安置在一个无法得知时间的场所，工作人员告知他们只要感到饥饿便可进食，结果他们的平均进食频率为每96分钟一次。

Sustained performance depends not just on eating at regular intervals but also on eating only as much as you need to drive your energy for the next two to three hours. Portion control is critical both in managing weight and in regulating energy. It is just as problematic to eat too much, too often, as it is to eat too little, too infrequently. Snacks between meals should typically be between 100 and 150 calories and once again should focus on low-glycemic foods such as nuts and sunflower seeds, fruits, or half of a typical-size 200 calorie energy bar.

想要维持良好表现，不仅要定期进食，还要每次摄入足以维持两至三个小时精力的食物。控制进食量在管理体重和管理精力两方面都很关键。多吃多餐跟少吃少餐一样有问题。两餐之间的零食热量应该控制在100至150卡路里之间，并选择低升糖指数的食物，例如坚果、葵花籽、水果或半条200卡的能量棒。

To maximize physical energy capacity, we must become more attuned to what satisfaction actually feels like—neither hungry nor stuffed. Most of us spend far too much time at one end of the scale or the other, often swinging wildly between the two extremes. (See Hunger Scale below.) We allow too much time to elapse between meals and then compensate by eating too much at once. Because our energy requirements tend to diminish as evening approaches and our metabolism slows, it makes sense to eat more calories earlier in the day and fewer in the evening. In one study of children ages seven to twelve, for example, subjects were classified into five weight categories, from thin to obese. On average, they all consumed about the same number of calories per day. The one variable, it turned out, was that the children in the two heaviest categories ate less at breakfast and more at dinner than their leaner counterparts. In a second study at the University of Minnesota, researchers compared groups of people on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet. Those who ate the largest percentage of their food earlier in the day felt less tired and lost 2.3 pounds a week more than those who ate the most later in the day.

为将体能最大化，我们必须让自己更加熟悉进食适当的程度——不感到饥饿也不感到撑胀。大多数人总是陷入两个极端（详见下方的饥饿指数），花了太长时间消化食物，又一次吃太多补回来。因为精力需求到夜晚会减少，新陈代谢也会减缓，因而早上多摄入热量、晚上少摄入热量是有科学道理的。在一项关于7～12岁孩子的研究中，受试者被分为从瘦到胖5个重量级。孩子们每日平均摄入的卡路里总量相同，结果最重的两个级别与其他人的差别在于早餐吃得少，晚餐吃得多。明尼苏达大学进行了另一项研究，研究者比较了每日摄入2000卡路里的人群，一天当中进食早的人群比后半天才大量进食的人群疲劳感更少，每周还会减重2.3磅。

Drinking water, we have found, is perhaps the most undervalued source of physical energy renewal. Unlike hunger, thirst is an inadequate barometer of need. By the time we feel thirsty, we may be long since dehydrated. A growing body of research suggests that drinking at least sixty-four ounces of water at intervals throughout the day serves performance in a range of important ways. Dehydrate a muscle by as little as 3 percent, for example, and it will lose 10 percent of its strength and 8 percent of its speed. Inadequate hydration also compromises concentration and coordination.

我们还发现，喝水或许是最常被人忽略的体能再生方式。口渴不会像饥饿一样散发出明显的信号，等我们感到口渴的时候，身体或许已经缺水很久了。一家研究机构称，每天至少饮用1.8公斤水对维持体能有诸多好处。肌肉若缺水3%就会失去10%的力量和8%的速度。喝水不足也会损害大脑的注意力和协调能力。

Drinking more water may even have health and longevity benefits. In a study of 20,000 people, Australian researchers found that those who drank five eight-ounce glasses of water a day were significantly less likely to die of coronary heart disease as those who drank two glasses of water or less. One possible reason is that dehydration may elevate risk factors such as blood viscosity. By contrast, the consumption of coffee and caffeinated sodas provided no statistically significant heart benefits. Like high-sugar foods, caffeinated drinks such as coffee, tea and diet colas provide temporary spikes of energy. Because caffeine is a diuretic, however, it prompts dehydration and fatigue in the long run.

多喝水还有助于健康和长寿。澳大利亚的研究员在一项2万人的调查中发现，每天喝5杯230毫升水的人比喝2杯以下的人死于冠心病的几率更小，有可能是因为缺水会升高血液黏稠的风险。然而，摄入咖啡和咖啡因饮料并未被证明对心脏有益。与高糖食物一样，咖啡因饮料如咖啡、茶和健怡可乐能瞬间提升精力，但由于咖啡因利尿，长期饮用依旧会导致缺水和疲倦。

## GEORGE D.: LOW ENERGY

George D., forty-one, is a music company executive who had long taken enormous satisfaction from work that he found creatively challenging and exciting. Increasingly, however, he complained that he had lost his passion for work and that he lacked the boundless energy that fueled him through his twenties. His first obstacle was all too visible. At five feet, eleven inches, he weighed 240 pounds, at least 50 more than his ideal weight and nearly all of it added during the past decade. His body fat percentage was 30—more than 10 percent above the maximum acceptable level for a man his age. Imagine for a moment the energy consequences of dragging around an extra fifty pounds each day. On average, we find that our clients gain approximately ten pounds a decade following college. Thirty-five percent of Americans are currently overweight, and another 25 percent are obese, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services—an epidemic rise during the past twenty years. In George’s case, we focused on how his eating habits might be affecting his basic energy levels and his sense of passion.

41岁的乔治是一家音乐公司的管理层人员，他曾一直热爱这份创意与挑战兼备的工作，带给他极大的满足感。然而，他渐渐抱怨自己对工作失去了热情，体力也不像20多岁时那么予取予求。他面临一项非常明显的问题：乔治身高1.8米，体重240磅，至少超出理想体重50磅，都是在过去10年里积攒起来的。他的体脂比例达到30，超出该年龄段体脂上限的10%。大家可以设想每天额外负重50磅带给你的精力消耗。我们发现，客户走出大学校门后的10年里会平均增重10磅。据卫生与公众服务部称，美国有35%的人超重，另外有25%的人属于肥胖范畴。这是过去20年间开始的变化趋势。对于乔治，我们的注意力主要放在研究饮食习惯如何影响他的基本精力水平和工作热情上。

It turned out that George’s routine during the past several years was to eat lightly for much of the day, surviving mostly on coffee in the mornings and a salad or a bagel for lunch. Around 3:00 P.M. he would begin to feel both deeply fatigued and famished. When sweets weren’t available on his floor, he ran up to the employee cafeteria, long after it had stopped serving full meals for lunch, and grabbed a bag of chips and a piece of cake or a candy bar, rationalizing that he hadn’t eaten breakfast or lunch. At night, he ate whatever his wife served. Because she knew he was hungry by the time he got home, she made enough for several helpings.

我们发现，在过去几年里乔治习惯于在白天吃得少：早餐喝咖啡，午餐是一份沙拉或一个面包圈，然后在下午3点左右他感到疲倦和饥饿。管理层的楼层不卖食品，他就跑去员工餐厅，可是早已过了午餐时间，他只能买一袋薯片、一块蛋糕或一条糖果，用没吃早餐和午餐宽慰自己。晚上，妻子准备什么他就吃什么。因为知道他回家时经常饥肠辘辘，妻子总会准备丰盛的食物抚慰他空空的胃。

George’s problems began with skipping breakfast, perhaps the most important meal of the day. As we noted earlier, a high-octane breakfast not only increases blood glucose levels but also jump-starts metabolism. George experimented with several breakfast foods before deciding to alternate each day between whole-grain cereal with plain yogurt and a smoothie: protein powder, skim milk, a banana, and strawberries or blueberries. He also limited himself to a single cup of coffee, and replaced the coffee mug that he was used to carrying around with a bottle of water. At mid-morning, he ate half of an energy bar or a handful of pumpkin seeds or mixed nuts, an ample supply of which he kept in a desk drawer and also in his briefcase. The latter was especially useful when he found himself stuck in an airport, or taking a long drive in his car.

乔治不吃早餐就有问题。早餐是一天中最重要的一餐，我们之前说过，高质量的早餐不仅能够提高血糖水平，还可以强力推动新陈代谢。乔治尝试了多种食物，才决定用酸奶全麦麦片或加奶果汁——蛋白粉，脱脂牛奶，香蕉，草莓和蓝莓轮流作为早餐。他也限制自己只喝一杯咖啡，并用瓶装水代替以前随身携带的咖啡杯，上午吃半条能量棒或一把南瓜籽，有时是混合坚果，在抽屉和公文包里储备足量的食物：抽屉负责办公室工作的时间，公文包里的食物负责机场堵车或者长途旅行。

For lunch, George found a gourmet food shop two blocks from his office that had a salad bar stocked with an appetizing array of fresh vegetables, fruits and other healthy items. Each day he was able to create a different salad that was healthy but also appealing and even included very small amounts of high fat foods that he liked, such as cheese. At 3:00 P.M. when he ordinarily would have gone to the cafeteria for chips and sweets, George reached into his desk for one of the energy-rich snacks that he hadn’t eaten in the morning.

至于午餐，乔治找到了一家离办公室两个街区的食品店，里面的沙拉吧供应新鲜的水果、蔬菜及其他健康食品。他每天都可以尝试不同搭配，既美味又有趣，有时还会加一点他喜欢的高脂食物如奶酪。下午3点通常是乔治奔向餐厅买薯片和糖果的时间，现在他伸手从抽屉里拿一条上午没吃完的能量棒就好了。

For as long as he could remember, the two experiences that George most associated with food were intense hunger and bloatedness. As he began to eat smaller amounts at regular two -to-three-hour intervals, it dawned on him that for the first time he felt satisfied. Carrying a water bottle wherever he went and sipping at it all day long helped to keep his hunger at bay.

一直以来，乔治对于进食的印象要么伴随着饥饿，要么伴随着饱胀。开始每2～3小时的少量进餐习惯后，他才头一次体会到满足的感觉。随身携带瓶装水可以随时饮水，帮他抵抗饥饿感。

George made no attempt to change the foods that he was eating for dinner, but he did ask his wife to make smaller portions. During the first thirty days that he was instituting his ritual, he consciously placed on his plate the exact amount of food that he intended to eat and no more. We subscribe to an 80–20 rule. If 80 percent of what you eat fuels performance and health, you can eat whatever you like for the other 20 percent—so long as you control the size of the portions.

乔治并没有改变晚餐的内容，只是请妻子减小了份量。在最初30天，也就是习惯养成的阶段，他只拿理想分量的食物，不再盛第二碗。我们都赞同“80/20”的原则：如果你摄入的80%的食物都是健康而高效的，剩下的20%可以是你喜欢的任何食物，只要份量控制得当。

Several times a week around 8:30, George indulged his sweet tooth with a half dozen Hershey kisses or a small cup of frozen yogurt. By his best estimate, George only moderately reduced his caloric intake with his new eating habits, but he completely shifted what he ate and when. By the end of a week on his new eating regimen, he felt a noticeable increase in his energy levels throughout the day. To his delight, having more energy improved his his mood and his capacity for focus. As a bonus, George lost twenty-four pounds over the next six months and rarely felt deprived along the way. His body fat dropped to 23 percent. Without the extra weight, his energy levels continued to improve, and so did his sense of control over his life. He had occasional lapses, particularly at parties and over holidays, but at the end of a year, he had still kept most of the weight off and his capacity for work had increased markedly.

晚上8点半，乔治的甜食瘾可以用几颗好时巧克力或一小碗酸奶冰淇淋解馋。按照最好的情况估计，乔治只是通过新的饮食习惯在一定程度上减少了卡路里摄入量，但是完全改变了进食的内容和时间。在尝试新习惯一周后，乔治明显感到一天之内体力改善；令他高兴的是，充足的精力改善了他的情绪和专注力。他还收获了额外的惊喜——接下来的6个月中成功减重24磅，没有感觉抑制食欲，体脂比也降至23。因为不需要负担额外的重量，他的体力进一步提升，对生活的掌控感同样增强。他也有过几次松懈的情况，尤其是参加派对和节假日的时候。但是一年到头，他依然持续减重，工作能力也显著提高。

## CIRCADIANS AND SLEEP

Other than eating and breathing, sleeping is the most important source of recovery in our lives. It is also the most powerful of the circadian rhythms that include body temperature, hormone levels and heart rates. The vast majority of our clients report that they are significantly sleep deprived. Few of them recognize just how dramatically insufficient sleep affects their performance and their level of engagement both at work and at home.

除了进食和呼吸，睡眠是人类最重要的精力恢复来源。绝大多数的客户称自己的睡眠被严重剥夺，却鲜有人意识到睡眠不足会如何影响到工作表现以及对工作、生活和家庭的全情投入。

Even small amounts of sleep debt—insufficient recovery in our terms—have a significant impact on strength, cardiovascular capacity, mood and overall energy levels. Some fifty studies have shown that mental performance—reaction time, concentration, memory and logical/analytical reasoning—all decline steadily as sleep debt increases. Sleep needs vary by age, gender and genetic predisposition, but the broad scientific consensus is that the average human being needs seven to eight hours a night to function optimally. Several studies have shown that when human beings are placed in isolation, with no exposure to natural light or to clocks, they still sleep approximately seven to eight hours out of every twenty-four.

即便少量的睡眠缺失——我们称为精力再生不足——也会深刻影响力量、心血管能力、情绪和整体精力水平。大约有50项研究表明，思维能力——即反应时间、专注力、记忆力、逻辑分析及辩证能力——会随着睡眠不足而衰退。睡眠需求随年龄、性别、基因体能而异，但普遍的科学共识是：人体每晚需要7至8小时的睡眠才可以运转良好。还有数项研究发现，即使将人们隔绝自然光或钟表，他们还是会每24小时睡眠7至8个小时。

In one especially dramatic study, psychologist Dan Kripke and his colleagues studied the sleep patterns of one million people over six years. Mortality rates from nearly all causes of death were lowest among people who slept between seven and eight hours a night. For those sleeping less than four hours, mortality rates were two and a half times higher. For those sleeping more than ten hours the rates were one and a half times higher. In short, both too little recovery and too much recovery appear to significantly increase the risk of mortality.

在一项大型的研究中，心理学家丹·克里普克与同事追踪了100万人在六年间的睡眠模式，每晚睡7～8小时的人死亡率最低，睡眠不足4小时的人死亡率较前者高出2.5倍，而睡眠超过10小时的人死亡率相比高出1.5倍。简而言之，精力再生不足或再生过量都会增加死亡的风险。

The specific times that we sleep also affect our energy levels, health and performance. Numerous studies have shown that shift workers—meaning those who work at night—have twice the number of highway accidents as day workers and considerably more on-the-job accidents as well. Shift workers also suffer a far higher incidence of coronary artery disease and heart attacks than do day workers. On a broader scale, every one of the great industrial disasters of the past twenty years—Chernobyl, the Exxon Valdez, Bhopal, Three Mile Island—occurred in the middle of the night. For the most part, those in charge had worked very long hours and built up considerable sleep debt. The disastrous crash of the Challenger space shuttle in 1986, in which seven astronauts lost their lives, occurred after NASA officials made an ill-fated judgment to go ahead with the launch, having already worked for more than twenty consecutive hours.

睡眠的时间点也会影响精力储备、身体健康及工作表现。有无数研究表明倒班工作者，即需要夜间工作的人，比日间工作者的道路交通事故多出一倍，也更容易出现工伤的情况。倒班工作者也比日间工作者更易诱发冠状动脉疾病和心脏病。如果从更大范围来看，过去20年间，所有的大型工业事故——切尔诺贝利、艾克森瓦尔迪兹、博帕尔和三里岛事件，都发生在半夜，多数情况都是现场负责人已经长时间工作并经常睡眠不足。 1986年，挑战者号宇宙飞船的悲剧导致7名宇航员丧生，也是由于美国航空航天局的官员连续工作20多个小时后做出了继续发射的不幸决定。

The longer, more continuously, and later at night you work, the less efficient and more mistake-prone you become.

夜晚工作的时间越长、越连续、结束得越晚，你会变得越低效，也更容易犯错误

In addition to its energy renewing function, sleep is also a period during which substantial growth and repair occurs—most of it at the deepest level of sleep, when slow-wave delta brainwaves are dominant. During those periods, cell division is most active, the greatest number of growth hormones and repair enzymes are released and muscles that have been stressed during the day have an opportunity to regenerate. In short, we heal and grow most during the deepest periods of recovery.

除了精力再生，睡眠还是成长与修复的阶段，尤其是慢波三角波主导的深层睡眠阶段。这段时期细胞分裂最旺盛，机体释放出最多的生长荷尔蒙和修复酶，白天持续紧张的肌肉得以恢复活力。可以说，我们的机体在深层修复和成长。

There may be no more extreme example of deliberately overriding the human need for intermittent recovery than the long-standing system of training medical students to become physicians. They work in shifts as long as 36 consecutive hours and for as many as 120 hours in a week. In 1984, the journalist Sidney Zion brought a widely publicized lawsuit after his daughter Libby died following a visit to the emergency room of a New York City hospital. A grand jury ultimately concluded that she had received “woefully inadequate” care from inexperienced interns and residents operating on little or no sleep.

医学院学生长久以来的培训系统或许是说明人们急需间歇休整的最极端案例。医务工作者一般需要连续倒班36个小时，每周工作120个小时。1984年记者西德尼·锡安提出一场广受关注的诉讼，他的女儿莉比在纽约一家医院的急诊室内去世。大陪审团裁定她受到了经验不足的实习生和“能力严重不足”的实习医生的治疗，而这些医护人员几乎没有得到休息。

Three years after Libby Zion’s death, the State of New York instituted new regulations that included limiting scheduled workweeks for residents (and other critical-care specialists) to no more than eighty hours and scheduled shifts to no more than twenty-four hours. In 2002, the national association that accredits physicians put the same twenty-four hour limit on maximum shifts for all of the nation’s 100,000 medical residents. It was hardly a complete solution. In Japan, for example, the cause of death can be attributed to karoshi, or overwork, if a worker has put in twenty-four consecutive hours just before death. According to the National Academy of Sciences, medical errors, many of them at least partly caused by fatigue among doctors, account for nearly 100,000 deaths a year, more than from motor vehicle accidents, breast cancer and AIDS combined.

莉比·锡恩过世3年后，纽约州颁布一项新规定，实习医生（以及其他急救护理人员）每周工作时间不得超过80小时，倒班不得超过24小时。2002年，掌管医师任命的国家机构也设立了相同的规定，要求全国10万名实习医师倒班不得超过24小时。然而这并不是解决问题的万全之策。在日本，如果死者在死前刚刚连续工作24小时，死因可以归为过劳死或过度工作。美国国家科学院的数据显示，医疗失误很大程度都是因为医生的疲劳。每年有近10万起医疗失误导致的死亡案例，超过机动车事故、乳腺癌和艾滋病死亡人数的总和。

For years, medical school and hospital administrators have argued that compelling residents to work long hours makes them better able to handle the pressures that they will have to face as doctors. But try asking a hospital administrator whether he is comfortable driving on a highway at night alongside truck drivers who haven’t slept for twenty-four hours; or flying on a plane in which a young pilot in training - hasn’t slept for thirty hours; or living in the vicinity of a nuclear plant in which new operators work in isolation for twelve-hour shifts through the night. The real reason that young physicians-in-training work such long shifts is economic. The cost of implementing the new post–Libby Zion regulations in New York state alone—mostly related to replacing lost hours of labor by residents—has been estimated to be in excess of $225 million a year.

多年来，医学院和医院机构认为强制实习医师长时间工作是为了更好应对医务工作的压力。但试问医院负责人，你是否愿意夜间行驶在高速公路上，后面有辆大卡车紧跟着你，而卡车司机已经24小时没有休息过了？你是否愿意乘坐一架由还在培训期的飞行员驾驶的飞机，而他已经30小时没合过眼了？你又是否愿意住在一座核能设施周边，管理员都是新人且每24小时轮班一次？在我们看来，医院安排年轻的实习医生超时工作，不过是为了经济效益。执行新规定带来的损失——多数是为弥补实习医生轮班时间减少的支出，仅在纽约州每年就超过22.5亿美元。

A better understanding of how to efficiently manage stress-recovery ratios would likely eliminate much of that cost—and save many lives. Sleep researcher and physiologist Claudio Stampi undertook a study in which subjects were deprived of normal sleep, and instead took twenty-to-thirty-minute naps every four hours. Naps represent a form of strategic recovery. Stampi found that napping workers were able to maintain a surprisingly high level of alertness and productivity over twenty-four hours, even in the absence of a more prolonged sleep. The only caveat was that the naps had to be timed to insure that the subjects didn’t fall into deeper stages of sleep. After more than thirty to forty minutes of sleep, many of them emerged feeling groggy and even more fatigued than if they hadn’t napped at all.

更好地高效精力管理极有可能抵消这部分损失，还可以拯救更多的生命。睡眠研究员、心理学家克劳迪奥·斯坦皮做过一项实验，受试者被剥夺了正常睡眠，但是每4小时可以小憩20～30分钟。小憩就是一种精力恢复手段。斯坦皮发现，小睡片刻的工人即便不能长时间睡眠，仍可以保持超过24小时的惊人高效和敏锐。唯一需要注意的地方就是小憩需要定时，以免受试者陷入更深的睡眠中。如果小憩超出30或40分钟，许多受试者会感到眩晕无力，甚至比不睡更加疲倦。

## JODY R.: POOR CONCENTRATION

A night owl, Jody R. struggled with getting to bed at a reasonable time each night and struggled even more with waking up in the morning. Her father had the same pattern, and Jody felt convinced that her sleep habits were encoded in her genes. She rarely got to sleep before 1:00 A.M. and she had to be up for work by 6:00 A.M. An ordinary night’s sleep was five hours. The result was that she lived in a permanent state of fatigue and felt certain that it affected both her level of engagement and her ability to concentrate, especially in the mornings, when she typically felt groggy and out of it.

让夜猫子乔迪早点睡觉并不是件轻松的事情，让她早点起床也同样困难。她的父亲同样没这个习惯，所以她认为这是基因遗传的结果。乔迪很少在凌晨1点前睡觉，却不得不在6点起床工作，夜间睡眠长期不足5个小时，导致她十分疲倦，并严重影响了工作的投入性和专注程度。尤其是早上，她总会感觉头晕无力。

We asked Jody how she spent the last couple of hours each night, and she told us that she alternated between answering email, playing solitaire and reading novels. None of these activities, she acknowledged, were critically important. With that in mind, we helped her to design a ritual aimed at disengaging earlier in the evening. Because she enjoyed taking baths and found them deeply relaxing, she decided to make a bath her nightly pre-sleep ritual at 10:00 P.M. Afterward, around 10:30, she went downstairs to her kitchen and had a cup of chamomile tea.

我们询问乔迪，每晚临睡前几个小时她都在做什么。她告诉我们，回复邮件，或者玩单人纸牌或者读小说。她自己也承认，里面并没有重要到会影响睡觉的事情。于是我们帮她设计了提早结束晚间活动的习惯。因为她喜欢沐浴，并在沐浴时感到放松，我们建议她在10点进行睡前沐浴，并在10点半结束，然后去楼下厨房泡一杯洋甘菊茶。

Jody was a worrier and one of the obstacles to falling asleep was that she tended to ruminate about the day ahead. At 10:45 P.M., when she got into bed, the first thing we had her do was to open the journal that she had purchased and half-jokingly named “Catharsis.” Jody spent the next ten to fifteen minutes writing down any issues that she had on her mind and any thoughts she had about how to deal with them. Having committed whatever she was worrying about to paper, she found that she could usually let it go for the night. The final step in her ritual was to read for fifteen or twenty minutes—nonfiction. When she became absorbed in a novel, it tended to draw her in and keep her awake. When she focused on a more difficult and demanding book, it made her feel tired. Once she turned out her light at 11:15, Jody consciously turned her thoughts to some event in her life that evoked positive, relaxed feelings.

乔迪是一个很爱操心的人，她的入睡障碍之一就是习惯躺在床上回顾一天的事情。 10点45分左右她爬上床，我们让她做的第一件事拿出日记本进行“精神宣泄”，用10到15分钟写下她脑海里想到的事情，以及她对于某些问题的想法。当脑海中的东西都变为纸上文字时，一天也该结束了。睡前仪式习惯的最后一项是15～20分钟的读书时间——非小说类型，因为小说的连续情节会吸引她一直读到很晚，不利于睡眠。如果阅读更高深的书籍，很快就会疲倦。 11点15分，乔迪关上灯，带着积极而轻松的思维进入梦乡。

The second part of Jody’s ritual centered on waking up. We urged her to begin by moving her alarm clock far enough away from her bed that turning it off would require getting up. We also urged her to immediately turn on all of the lights in the room, in order to stimulate her body to wake up. Next, Jody put on exercise clothes and immediately took a brisk ten-to fifteen-minute walk outside, once again to expose herself to natural light and increase her alertness. (High fitness makes it possible to perform on less sleep. If time is an issue, substituting a half hour of cardiovascular exercise or strength training for a half hour of sleep is a great trade.) Finally, Jody committed to eating a very light breakfast. Like most night owls, she simply didn’t feel hungry in the morning, but eating, even lightly, was critical to jump-starting her metabolism.

第二部分就是起床。我们建议她把闹钟放得远远的，只有起床才能关掉它。我们也建议她一醒来就打开房间里所有灯，进一步刺激身体醒来。接下来，她穿上运动衫到户外快步走10～15分钟，自然光线也能促进清醒。（健康的身体可以在较少睡眠下保持良好运作。如果时间紧张，用半个小时睡眠换半个小时心血管锻炼或力量训练也很划算。）最后，乔迪答应吃一份轻量早餐。因为大多数夜猫子早起时都不饿，但是即便少量进食，对促进新陈代谢也至关重要。

During the first two weeks after instituting her new ritual, Jody slipped several times and stayed up as late as 1:00 A.M. But after succeeding for several days at turning off her light at 11:15—and then sleeping an average of seven hours—her energy level and her mood improved dramatically. She also found it much easier to wake up in the mornings. While she hated taking a brisk morning walk at first, doing so eventually become the part of her ritual she most enjoyed. It not only proved to be energizing, but also gave her an opportunity to reflect quietly on the day ahead before events overtook her.

在培养新习惯的前两周，乔迪还是溜过几次号，熬到凌晨1点才睡。但接连几天11点15分关灯，平均每天睡上7个小时，她的精力和情感都大大改善，早晨起床也变得容易了。起初，她不喜欢去户外快步走，到后来快步走却成为她最喜欢的一部分。它不仅让人精力充沛，还让她得以思考一天内需要处理的事情。

By the end of four weeks, Jody was a convert. Her lights were out by 11:15 most nights. Eventually, she found that she didn’t even require an alarm clock to get up. More important, both her mood and her capacity to sustain attention throughout the day noticeably improved.

4周以后，乔迪已经彻底改变了以往的作息习惯。多数晚上，乔迪都能准时在11点15分熄灯。最后，她甚至不需要闹铃就能起床。最重要的是，她的情绪和白天保持全神贯注的能力都有了显著进步。

## OUR DAILY PULSE

You need not be a medical resident—or work exceptionally long hours—for fatigue and insufficient recovery to influence your level of engagement and performance. Just as we cycle through levels of sleep at night, so our potential for engagement varies during our waking hours. The shifts of energy that we experience are tied to the ultradian rhythms that regulate physiological markers of alertness at 90-to 120-minute intervals. Unfortunately, many of us override these naturally occurring rhythms to the point that they no longer even penetrate conscious awareness. The demands of our everyday lives are so intense and so consuming that they distract our attention from the subtler internal signals telling us that we need recovery.

人们不需要成为实习医师或者经历超长时间的工作才能体会到疲倦，感受到精力不足对专注力和行为表现的影响。我们在晚间经历多次睡眠循环，白天里精力的潜能也在不断变化。精力的波动与次昼夜节律息息相关，生理信号以90～120分钟为周期。不幸的是，大多数人都习惯于无视自然的节奏，直到大脑再也无法理解那些信号的含义。生活每天对人们的要求都很高，需要消耗大量体力，思维很容易忽略身体传来的微妙的恢复信号。

In the absence of any artificial interventions, our energy stores naturally ebb and flow at different times of the day. Somewhere around 3:00 or 4:00 P.M. we reach the lowest phase of both our ultradian and our circadian rhythms. The Japanese sleep researchers Yoichi Tsuji and Toshinori Kobayashi have termed this “the breaking point”—the period of the day when most of us feel the highest level of fatigue. The documented vulnerability to accidents is far higher in the mid-afternoon than at any other daytime period. This explains why, over the centuries, so many cultures intuitively institutionalized the sort of midafternoon nap that is increasingly disappearing in our 24/7 world.

一旦缺少主观干预，精力储备会在一天内数次降低，下午3点或4点是次昼夜和昼夜节律的最低点。日本睡眠研究员辻洋一和小林利纪将它命名为“极限点”，即一天中最疲倦的时刻。中午、下午的事故易发率远远高于白天其他的时间点。这也解释了为何许多文明在过去的几个世纪中主动重拾午后的小憩，而这种片刻小憩在当今全天候的世界已经越来越罕见了。

NASA’s Fatigue Counter Measures Program has found that a short nap of just forty minutes improved performance by an average of 34 percent and alertness by 100 percent. In another recent study by Harvard researchers, subjects whose performance on a series of tasks dropped by as much as 50 percent in the course of a day were able to completely restore their highest levels of performance after a one-hour nap in the early afternoon. Winston Churchill was among the world leaders who clearly understood the strategic value of naps:

美国航空航天局在对抗疲劳的实验中发现，小睡40分钟效能可提高34%，并达到完全的清醒。哈佛大学研究员也发现，参加多项任务的受试者精力可能会降低50%，而只需午睡1个小时就能重新达到效能顶峰。世界很多领导人物都清楚地了解小憩的重要价值，其中就包括温斯顿·丘吉尔：

> You must sleep some time between lunch and dinner and no halfway measures. Take off your clothes and get into bed. That’s what I always do. Don’t think you will be doing less work because you sleep during the day. That’s a foolish notion held by people who have no imagination. You will accomplish more. You get two days in one—well, at least one and a half, I’m sure. When the war started, I had to sleep during the day because that was the only way I could cope with my responsibilities.
>
> 你必须在午餐和晚餐之间抽空睡一会儿，别无他法。脱下衣服躺在床上，这就是我的习惯。不要认为自己在白天睡一会儿就会耽误工作，这是毫无想象力的人才有的愚蠢想法。你总会收获更多。你能把一天当作两天用——至少是一天半，我敢肯定。战争开始后，我也必须保证白天的休息。只有这样，我才能完全担负起自己的责任。

While this luxury is not available to most people in business today, brief periods of rest are critical to sustaining energy over long hours. Those among our clients who find a way to get real recovery breaks throughout the day—and best of all brief catnaps sometime in the afternoon—consistently report that they sustain high energy well into the evenings.

虽然日间休息对于大多数职场人过于奢侈，但短暂休息确实利于长时间保持精力。我们发现，白天能真正休息片刻的人晚间的精力也仍旧高涨。

## BRUCE R.: WORK-LIFE BALANCE

By his own admission, Bruce R. was a workaholic. A highly successful thirty-seven-year-old executive for a magazine publishing company, he regularly arrived at work at 7:00 A.M., ate lunch most days at his desk, never left earlier than 7 P.M., and often worked at home late into the evening. Bruce prided himself on putting in longer hours than any of his colleagues—as many as eighty a week. He also acknowledged that his schedule was beginning to take a toll on him and on his family. His output hadn’t diminished, but his long days left him feeling racy and distracted and his sense of resentment and edginess had noticeably increased. He had three children, seven, four, and two, and his wife had stopped working when their second child was born. Increasingly, Bruce told us, she complained that he was rarely available to the family. Bruce felt especially guilty about not being a more involved father. His own father had been a highly driven corporate executive who devoted very little time to his family, and Bruce felt that he had suffered from his father’s absence. He came to us seeking help in finding more balance in his life, but he made it clear that he wasn’t willing to sacrifice his performance in work that he loved.

布鲁斯承认自己是一个工作狂。 37岁的他是一家杂志发行公司的高层管理人员，每天早上7点准时到达办公室，中午在办公桌前解决午餐，直到晚上7点之前从未离开过办公室，即使回家后，他也总是工作到深夜。布鲁斯为自己的工作时长远超其他同事而自豪，每周工作时间高达80个小时。他承认，这样的工作安排影响了自己和家庭。虽然他的工作成效没有减少，但是漫长的一天让他难以保持注意力，怨恨和急躁感愈加明显。他有3个孩子，分别是7岁、 4岁和2岁，自从第二个孩子出生后，他的妻子就不工作了。布鲁斯告诉我们，妻子慢慢开始对他的不顾家有了怨言。布鲁斯对自己没有尽到做父亲的责任感到尤其内疚。布鲁斯的父亲就是一位很繁忙的企业高管，分给家庭的时间很少。布鲁斯对父亲角色缺失带给他的影响深有体会。于是他找到我们，希望我们能帮他建立平衡的生活，并明确指出不愿牺牲自己所爱的工作，损害工作表现。

Bruce was moved by the evidence that the world’s best athletes all build highly structured recovery routines into their lives. If periodic disengagement had the potential to help him be more effective at work, he found that reassuring. Highly structured by nature, he was willing to experiment with building rituals of renewal. The key, we explained, was to find forms of recovery that truly helped him to change channels and disengage from his work.

世界级运动选手都有严格的休息习惯，这一点打动了布鲁斯。如果短期从工作中抽离可以令接下来的工作更有效率，他愿意尝试培养精力再生的习惯。我们告诉他，关键是要帮他转换频道，真正脱离工作。

When we asked Bruce what nonwork activities gave him a feeling of real relaxation, the first one that he thought of was getting his shoes shined. He worked in a midtown Manhattan high-rise, and there was a shoeshine parlor three blocks from his office. Bruce decided that three times a week he would get up from his desk at 10:00 A.M. and walk to the shoeshine parlor. He had a favorite shoeshine man there, a buoyant man in his seventies who told wonderful stories. Between the walk to the stand, the shoeshine itself and the entertaining conversation, Bruce found those twenty minutes to be almost pure pleasure. He - didn’t have enough shoes to justify a visit five days a week, so on Tuesdays and Thursdays, his break consisted instead of walking down ten flights of stairs to the Starbucks near his office and having his one cherished cup of coffee for the day.

当我们问布鲁斯，工作之外哪种活动能让他真正放松，他第一个想到的是擦鞋。他在曼哈顿中心的一座大厦上班，离办公室3个街区远就有一家擦鞋店。布鲁斯决定，每周拿出三天，在上午10点离开办公室前往擦鞋店。他很喜欢店里的一位擦鞋匠，那是一位70多岁的老人，很会讲故事。步行到擦鞋店，接受擦鞋服务，与老人展开愉快的对话，布鲁斯在这20分钟里感到了单纯的快乐。因为他没有那么多皮鞋要擦，不能每天都去擦鞋店，所以他在周二和周四上午的间歇休息改成步行走下10层楼，去公司附近的星巴克点一杯自己喜欢的咖啡。

For lunch, Bruce still preferred not to go out, but he agreed to set aside his work for fifteen or twenty minutes. A classical music aficionado, he decided to put on his Walkman and listen to Beethoven or Mozart while he ate. Bruce discovered yet another form of recovery during the time he spent with us: yoga and breathing. At 3:00 P.M., he closed the door to his office, took off his shoes, and went through his postures on the floor for ten minutes. He followed this with ten minutes of deep breathing. It took him four weeks to lock in these new rituals so that they began to exert a noticeable pull on him.

布鲁斯依旧不愿意外出吃午餐，但他同意在15～20分钟的吃饭时间里停止工作。作为古典音乐发烧友，他喜欢戴上耳机，一边听贝多芬或莫扎特的曲子，一边享受食物。布鲁斯还找到了另外的放松方式：瑜伽和呼吸。下午3点，他会掩上办公室的门，脱掉鞋子，在地板上做10分钟瑜伽练习，然后深呼吸10分钟。他用了4周时间巩固这些新习惯，现在每天都能自觉完成这些事情，不用督促。

Over time, Bruce built two other recovery rituals into his life. The first was for weekends. He wasn’t prepared to give up work altogether, but in order to give more of himself to his family, he limited weekend work to two short, specific periods of time. The first was early Saturday mornings from 6:00 to 8:00 A.M., usually before anyone else was up. This allowed him to focus on paperwork that he had found it difficult to get done at the office. By dealing with it Saturday morning, it didn’t weigh on him throughout the weekend. Unless there was an emergency, Bruce decided not to work on business at all the rest of Saturday and throughout the day Sunday.

布鲁斯还建立了另外两条休息仪式习惯。第一项是针对周末时间的。他并不打算完全丢开工作，但是为了有更多时间陪伴家人，他把周末的工作压缩在两个时间段。一个是周六早上6点至8点间，家人还没有起床，他可以专心做完办公室留下的文书工作。除非事出紧急，布鲁斯决定，周六的其他时间和整个周日白天都不会处理工作事务了。

The second work period was from 8:00 to 10:00 P.M. on Sunday evenings after his children went to sleep. This gave him the opportunity to catch up on email that came in over the weekend and plan for the week ahead. Bruce was not perfect in any of his rituals. When he fell behind at work, or faced an anxiety-producing deadline, he sometimes skipped his scheduled breaks during the day or felt himself preoccupied with work during the weekend. But whenever that happened, he noticed that he invariably felt less positive, more tired by the end of the day and more compromised in his ability to connect with his family.

第二个时间段是周日晚8点至10点，孩子们上床睡觉之后。这时他可以查收两天里积攒的邮件并规划下周的工作。布鲁斯并没有时时刻刻遵循这些新的休息方式。当赶不上工作进度或者面临工作期限时，他偶尔会征用休息时间，或是觉得需要在周末继续工作。但是一旦这样做，他会明显感到更加疲倦，情绪不佳，无法与家人更好地沟通。

The final recovery ritual that Bruce built was specifically for travel. He spent a fair amount of time on airplanes and he had always found this part of his life stressful and energy depleting. After 9/11, it became more difficult than ever. In an effort to transform his experience and to give himself a positive source of recovery, Bruce began packing a book that he would read purely for pleasure. He permitted himself to read the book only when he was on an airplane. The result was that he began to enjoy travel in a way that he never had before. Flying became far less of a stress in his life.

## RAISING THE BAR

Given the number of benefits that we derive even from moderate exercise, it seems extraordinary that the vast majority of Americans do almost none. The explanation is surprisingly simple. Building strength and endurance requires pushing past our comfort zones and experiencing discomfort. It takes time before the obvious benefits kick in, and most of us quit before that ever occurs.

即便适度锻炼有诸多益处，大多数美国人还是几乎不锻炼。原因很简单。提升力量与耐力需要我们踏出舒适区，体验不适的感觉，并且需要持续一定时间才能见效。但大多数人在看到明显的效果之前就放弃了。

Both strength and cardiovascular training have a powerful impact on health, on energy levels and on performance (see box). Ever since the publication of Kenneth Cooper’s book Aerobics in the mid-1960s, conventional wisdom has held that the best way to build fitness is through sustained aerobic or steady-state training. Our own experience is that interval training is preferable to continuous exercise and stress. Interval training first emerged as a method for increasing both the speed and endurance of runners in Europe in the 1930s. It involves short-to-moderate periods of exertion alternated with short-to-moderate periods of rest or reduced effort. The underlying premise is that a greater amount of intense work can be accomplished if it is interspersed with periods of rest.

力量和心脑血管锻炼会显著影响健康、精力水平和效能表现（见附表）。自肯尼斯·库珀《有氧运动》一书于20世纪60年代中期出版，大众普遍认为，最好的健身方式是持续的有氧运动或稳态训练。但从我们总结的经验来看，间歇训练却优于持续的训练。间歇训练最初在20世纪30年代的欧洲出现，用以增强跑步运动员的速度和耐力。它的核心理论是：如果加入休息时间，身体可以完成更高强度的工作。

The typical recommended exercise protocol is twenty to thirty minutes of continuous exercise, three to five days a week, at 60 to 85 percent of maximum heart rate. More recently, however, in a joint study conducted by Harvard and Columbia Universities, researchers found that a series of short doses of intense aerobic activity—each one sixty seconds or less—followed by complete aerobic recovery, had a profound positive impact on participants. In a period of just eight weeks, the subjects exhibited significant improvements in cardiovascular fitness, heart-rate variability and mood. They also evidenced stronger immune systems and lower diastolic blood pressure.

人们普遍推崇的健身方式是20～30分钟的连续锻炼，每周进行3到5次，锻炼期间心率达到最大值的60%到85%。最近哈佛大学和哥伦比亚大学发起一项联合研究，研究员发现一系列短时间、高强度的有氧练习——维持60秒左右——加上完整的有氧恢复过程，对于受试者有出人意料的积极影响。只需8周时间，受试者的心脑血管健康水平显著提升，心率变化减少，情绪得以改善，免疫力提高，舒张压也降低不少。

> * A study in the journal Ergonomics concluded that “Mental performance was significantly better in the physically fit than in the un-fit. Fit workers committed 27% fewer errors on tasks involving concentration and short-term memory as compared to un-fit workers.”

We believe in the value of interval training not just for its physical benefits, but also for its practical applicability in navigating the challenges that we face in everyday life. Interval training has long been at the heart of our training process. It can take many forms: sprinting, walking up stairs and down, bicycling and even weight lifting, so long as the effect is to rhythmically raise and lower heart rate.

我们相信间歇性训练的价值，不仅因为可以保持健康的身体，还因为它可以提高每天应对挑战的能力。间断性训练长久以来都是我们训练系统的核心组成部分。参与方式有很多，包括短跑、爬楼梯、骑自行车甚至举重，只要能够节奏性地提高和降低心率即可。

Interval training is a means by which to build more energy capacity and to tolerate more stress, but also to teach the body to recover more efficiently.

间歇训练可以增大精力的容量，使身体可以承担更多压力，并且更加高效地恢复

Both energy expenditure and energy recovery are active physiological processes. In our experience, any form of linear energy expenditure—physical, emotional, mental or spiritual—is suboptimal for performance and potentially destructive over time. Full engagement requires the capacity to respond quickly and flexibly to whatever demands we face in our lives, but also to shut down and restore equilibrium quickly and efficiently.

精力消耗和再生都是活跃的生理过程。从我们的经验来看，体能、情感、思维或意志精力的单线化消耗都不利于最优表现，甚至会随着时间出现潜在的危害。全情投入需要快速反应力，应对各种要求的灵活性，此外，还有停下消耗快速高效地重塑平衡的能力。

## STRENGTH FOR LIFE

Strength training is every bit as important as cardiovascular training, in part because loss of physical strength is so connected with the markers of aging and with reduced energy capacity. On average, we lose nearly one-half pound of muscle mass per year after the age of forty in the absence of regular strength training. Since the mid-1980s, researchers at Tufts University have produced extraordinary data about the effects of strength training among the elderly. In a study published in the Journal of American Medical Association in 1990, for example, a group of nursing home residents ages eighty-six to ninety-six underwent a strength-training program. All of them had serious chronic diseases and most of them used walkers or canes. After training just three days a week for eight weeks, the subjects increased their average strength by 175 percent and their balance by 48 percent.

力量训练与心血管训练同等重要，体力丧失是机体衰老和能力下降的显著特征。过了40岁，如果没有日常的力量训练，人们平均每年失去1/2磅的肌肉重量。 20世纪80年代中期，塔夫茨大学的研究员收集了关于老年人力量训练的大量数据。 1990年，发表在《美国医学会杂志》上的一项研究针对养老院中年龄86～96岁的老人发起力量训练，所有受试者都有严重的慢性疾病，大多数依靠拐杖才能行走。就在为期8周、每周三次的训练之后，受试者的力量平均增长175%，平衡能力增强48%。

More recently, one of the Tufts researchers, Miriam Nelson, launched a controlled study of women aged fifty-five to seventy who had previously done no exercise at all. After a year, those who continued not to exercise lost 2 percent of their bone density and suffered an 8.5 percent loss of balance. Those who undertook a three-day-a-week strength-training program gained 1 percent in bone density and 14 percent in balance. More broadly, strength training has also been shown to increase overall energy, speed metabolism and strengthen the heart.

最近，塔夫茨大学的研究员米丽亚姆·尼尔森开展一项针对年龄在52～70岁之间的女性的对照研究。所有受试者在加入研究之前都不参加运动。一年以后，仍然不做运动的女性骨质密度下降2%，平衡感下降8.5%。而每周参加3次力量训练的女性骨质密度增加1%，平衡感提升14%。从更广的层面来讲，力量训练也已经证实可以全面增强精力、加速新陈代谢并强健心脏。

The growing consensus among physiologists is that muscle loss, more than any single factor, is responsible for both the frailty and the diminished vitality associated with old age. Loss of bone density, for example, vastly increases the incidence of osteoporosis, which makes the bones far more fragile and affects some 25 million Americans. By the age of ninety, one in three women will have suffered a fracture of the hip. Remarkably, more women die as a consequence of hip fractures than from breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer combined.

越来越多的生理学家认为，肌肉损失是导致老龄化虚弱的最主要原因。骨质密度下降会增大骨质疏松的风险，让骨头变得更加脆弱，约有2 500万美国人受到影响。 90岁以上人群中，有三分之一的女性发生过髋骨骨折，而髋骨骨折导致的死亡率超出乳腺癌、子宫癌、卵巢癌的总和。

Building physical energy capacity is sometimes referred to as “toughening.” In the largely sedentary world of white-collar workers, the absence of any regular physical demand precludes the natural toughening that occurs simply from a physically active life. The result is that as we age, most of us have less energy available to cope with challenging and stressful situations.

对需要坐在办公桌前工作的大批白领来说，日常锻炼的缺乏阻碍了机体的自然增强，导致年龄增长后，大多数人应对挑战和压力的能力都逐渐下降。

A long-term study of soldiers who participated in one of the most intensive training programs in the armed forces clearly supports this conclusion. The study included some two hundred soldiers who underwent the Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape Course, or SERE, taught at Fort Bragg’s JFK Special Warfare Center and School—one of the most rigorous and stressful trainings offered in any branch of the military.

针对士兵在军中接受密集训练的长期研究可以有力地支持我们的结论。约200名士兵参加了布拉格堡肯尼迪特种作战中心及特种作战学校的求生、规避、抵抗和逃生课程（SERE），该课程堪称所有军事机构中最严格、最高强度的训练。

The SERE participants were compared with soldiers undergoing other forms of training, as well as pilots performing military flight operations, novice skydivers making their first jump and civilian patients about to undergo major surgery. All subjects provided saliva samples, so that their stress hormone levels could be assessed before, during and after the demanding event. The study found that the SERE soldiers consistently recovered more quickly than others from a given stressful event, and in turn were better prepared to meet the next challenge. The key factor appeared to be the SERE method of exposing subjects to intense stress offset by intermittent recovery. As authors C. A. Morgan III and Major Gary Hazlett concluded:

该研究将SERE项目的参与者与其他训练课程的士兵进行比较——对比样本还有军用作战飞机飞行员、新手跳伞员和面临重大手术的平民患者。所有受试者需提供唾液样本，以便追踪他们在重大事件之前、当中及事后的压力荷尔蒙水平。研究发现， SERE项目的士兵总能比其他人更快从压力事件中恢复，准备好迎接下一次挑战。这种差别的关键原因，在于SERE课程是高强度压力与间歇休息交替进行的训练方式。作家摩根三世和黑兹利特这样总结：

Rigorous training improves a person’s ability to perform on the battlefield. . . . The concept of stress inoculation is very much like the concept of preventing a particular disease through vaccination. Like immunization, which occurs only when the vaccine is given in the proper dosage, stress inoculation occurs only when the stress intensity is at the optimal level—high enough to activate a person’s psychological and biological systems, but low enough so as not to overwhelm them. If the stress level is not high enough, inoculation will not occur; if the stress level is too high, stress sensitization will occur, and the individual will probably perform less effectively when he is stressed again.

严格的训练可以增强一个人在战场上的作战能力……压力免疫法的概念等同于通过接种疫苗预防疾病的概念。免疫系统需要经过适量疫苗注射才能激活，压力免疫也只有面对适当的压力强度才能发生。这个强度足以激活一个人心理和生理反应系统，又不会超出其承受范围。如果压力水平过低，则达不到免疫的效果；如果压力水平过高，就会导致压力敏感，个体在往后面对压力时会难以发挥出正常水平。

In short, minimizing or avoiding stress is just as destructive to capacity as excessive stress without recovery. In a study published in the medical journal Lancet, researchers looked at the effects of bed rest on some 16,000 patients with fifteen different medical problems. It turned out that patients got no significant beneficial effect from prolonged bed rest, regardless of their medical condition. To the contrary, bed rest tended to delay recovery and in some cases cause further damage to the patient. These conclusions even applied to conditions for which bed rest has long been recommended, including low back pain, recovery after a heart attack and acute infectious hepatitis.

简而言之，减少或避免压力与承担过度压力具有同等的损害效果。医学杂志《手术刀》的一篇论文中，研究员调取了15种不同病症的16 000名患者卧床休息的效果，发现无论对于何种病症，延长病人卧床休息的时间都没有明显益处。相反，卧床休息还会延缓康复过程，在某些病例中还会给患者造成更大损伤。这一结论还适用于长期以来一直鼓励卧床休息的病症，包括背痛、心脏病恢复及急性传染性肝炎等。

## FRANK K.: LOW STRESS TOLERANCE

The primary performance barrier that showed up on Frank K.’s Full Engagement Inventory was low stress tolerance—a tendency to become easily frustrated and harsh with others when under pressure. As a newly promoted department head for a large retailer that was struggling, Frank was frequently critical and often lost his temper with his colleagues. Despite his immense talent, he was not operating at his best—and his feedback from his direct reports confirmed that conclusion.

弗兰克最主要的表现障碍是对于压力的容忍限度——他很容易在压力下崩溃并对他人态度恶劣。作为一家大型零售公司新提拔的部门领导，弗兰克总是很挑剔，常常在同事面前大发脾气。尽管才华超群，弗兰克却始终没有发挥出自己最好的水平——来自顶头上司的反馈也证明了这一点。

Frank had an aversion to exercise. At the age of forty-six, he was perhaps twenty pounds overweight, but he still had more energy than most of the younger people he supervised. He understood that exercise would serve his health and periodically, under pressure from his wife, he halfheartedly took up jogging. The problem was that a blend of boredom and discomfort inevitably prompted him to give up within a couple of weeks.

弗兰克十分不乐意锻炼。作为46岁的壮年，即使他超重20磅，精力也胜过手下的年轻人。他明白锻炼对身体有益，并且在妻子的强烈要求下开始三心二意地慢跑。不出意料，在无聊和不适的双重打击下，他没跑几周就放弃了。

Our promise to Frank was that building regular exercise into his life would prove to be one powerful way to release his tension and get his emotions under better control. We also pointed out that he had never stuck with an exercise program long enough to derive any benefits. Skeptically but gamely, Frank committed to an exercise program for sixty days—the outer limit of what it typically takes to put a new ritual into place. He also signed up for a two-month membership at his local health club.

我们对弗兰克保证，定期锻炼可以缓解他的紧张感，帮助他更好地控制情感。我们也指出，因为他从未坚持参加任何健身项目，所以永远看不到效果。弗兰克虽然表示怀疑，他还是勇敢地签下了为期60天的训练课程——这通常也是养成新习惯所需的时间。他还在当地健身馆办了一张两个月的会员卡。

Next, we helped Frank to design an interval-based exercise program. The key to any new fitness regimen is to start slowly and build incrementally. We suggested that Frank purchase a heart-rate monitor as a way to measure precisely his stress-recovery patterns. Given his age and his lack of previous exercise, he set 140 beats a minute as his target heart rate. (Check with your physician before selecting your own target rate.) At first, Frank found that he could reach that rate simply by walking fast. He maintained it for sixty seconds and then slowed down until his heart rate dropped to 90. He repeated the same up-and-down sequence for the next twenty minutes. Rather than pushing himself continuously for twenty or twenty-five minutes, he was teaching his body both to tolerate stress and to recover efficiently.

下一步，我们帮弗兰克设计了周期性的锻炼计划。养成健身习惯的诀窍是由浅入深。我们建议弗兰克配置心率监测器以便准确掌握自己的压力-恢复模式。鉴于目前年龄和缺乏锻炼的历史，他的目标心率设定为每分钟140下。（如何设定目标心率请遵循医嘱。）起初，弗兰克发现只需快步走就能达到目标心率。维持目标心率60秒之后他便慢下步伐，直至心率降回90，这样周期模式保持20分钟。这种模式的要点在于，它并非要求身体承担20或25分钟的高度压力，而是教身体如何忍受短时间的压力并有效恢复。

Almost immediately, Frank discovered that working in intervals was more absorbing and more compelling than his previous attempts at jogging. He felt moderately pushed during his new workouts, but not to the point that he was tempted to quit. The second week, he began to experiment with different intervals on alternate days. On one day he moved in a narrower range between 100 and 130 heartbeats a minute. In the next session he oscillated between 100 and 140. Over time, he began jogging to reach the targeted rate.

弗兰克几乎立刻发现，这种周期锻炼比之前的慢跑更加有趣，也更容易坚持下来。在新的健身计划里，他可以慢慢提高锻炼的强度，不至于刚迈出一步就想放弃。第二周，他开始每隔一天变换不同的心率区间，某次将心率保持在100至130之间，下次提升至100～140的灵活区间。渐渐他需要慢跑才能达到目标心率了。

Initially, Frank committed to three mornings a week—Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 7:00 A.M. He chose those times on the grounds that if he didn’t get his exercise early, he was far less likely to do it at all. He also committed to strength training twice a week. Strength training is intrinsically a form of interval training—lifting a weight a certain number of repetitions and then resting. The most basic workout is exercising each of the six major body parts—shoulders, back, chest, biceps, triceps and legs—by doing a single set of eight to twelve repetitions for each body part at an appropriate weight. Once again, our goal was to get Frank to expose himself incrementally to challenge, but not to so much that he would feel sore, exhausted and tempted to quit.

起初，弗兰克打算每周锻炼三次，分别在周一、周三和周五早上7点半。他选择早晨的理由是如果不尽早锻炼，一天下来就更不想锻炼了。他还计划每周进行两次力量训练。力量训练的本质正是间歇训练——举重数次然后休息。最基础的力量训练包括身体6个主要部分——肩膀、背部、胸部、二头肌、肱三头肌和腿部，每个部分在适度负重下做一组8至12个重复动作。我们的目标是让弗兰克逐步承受更多压力，又不至于让他感到劳累、疲惫、想打退堂鼓。

In his fourth week, Frank had to meet a series of deadlines at work and he skipped three consecutive days of exercise. To his surprise, he actually missed exercising, and decided to go to his health club the following Sunday morning even though it wasn’t scheduled. On a whim, he took a spinning class and found that he loved it. Spinning is built around intervals—increasing and decreasing the tension and speed on a stationary bike while listening to music. Frank discovered that he could handle the challenge surprisingly well and that he enjoyed the camaraderie of his fellow spinners. He decided to add the Sunday class to his weekly regimen, and to build in a strength-training workout afterwards.

训练进行到第四周时，弗兰克需要赶上工作进度，不得已连续三天翘掉健身课程。让他惊讶的是，自己竟然很想念锻炼的感觉。所以他决定这周日去健身房补课，即使这个时间并不在原本的计划之内。他报名了动感单车课程，发现自己很喜欢。动感单车是在一辆静止的自行车上随着音乐加速或减速，也是一种间歇训练。他很快掌握了动作要领，并且很享受单车伙伴之间的情谊。他决定把周日课程加入计划表，并在单车课程后安排了力量训练。

Frank’s thirteen-year-old son loved bicycle riding, and as the weather got warmer, Frank suggested one Saturday morning that they take a ride together. They ended up bicycling ten miles to a nearby town, having breakfast together and then riding back. It dawned on Frank that this was a terrific way to spend time with his son, and he suggested that they do it again the following week. Without any fore-thought, it quickly became their Saturday morning routine and proved to be a precious time together for each of them.

弗兰克13岁的儿子喜欢骑单车。随着天气逐渐转暖，弗兰克提议他们在周六早晨一起出行。他们会骑到10英里外的小镇，吃过早餐再骑回家。弗兰克发现这是陪伴儿子的绝佳时机，于是提议他们下周继续。不需要多做考虑，单车出行变成了父子俩每周的例行活动，对两人来说这都是弥足珍贵的时光。

By the end of eight weeks, Frank had locked in a five-day-a-week exercise ritual that had largely acquired a life of its own. Much as we promised, it became an effective source of mental and emotional recovery, and he felt palpably less edgy at work. Because he also had more energy, he was able to get more done during the day and to feel less pressed in the evening.

8周训练结束了，弗兰克养成了每周锻炼5次的习惯，并重新找到了生活的意义。我们说过，身体锻炼是思维和情感精力的极佳源泉。弗兰克明显感到自己在工作中的脾气温和了许多，白天有更多精力处理工作，晚间情绪也好转起来。
