# Defining Purpose: The Rules of Engagement

If growth and development take place from the bottom up—from physical to emotional to mental to spiritual—change is powered from the top down. The most compelling source of purpose is spiritual, the energy derived from connecting to deeply held values and a purpose beyond one’s self-interest. Purpose creates a destination. It drives full engagement by prompting our desire to invest focused energy in a particular activity or goal. We become fully engaged only when we care deeply, when we feel that what we are doing really matters. Purpose is what lights us up, floats our boats, feeds our souls.

如果说成长和发展是自下而上的——从体能到情感到思维再到意志，改变则是自上而下进行的。意志力量是目标最充足的源泉，意志精力来源于深层价值取向和超越个人利益的目标。目标会激发决心。它促成了我们的全情投入，希望将精力集中在某件事或某个目标上。只有真正深刻地关心自己所做的事情，认为自己所为真正有意义，人们才有可能做到全情投入。使命感是我们的火种，我们的动力，也是我们的精神食粮。

The search for meaning and purpose is among the most powerful and enduring themes in every culture since the origin of recorded history. It shows up in stories as early as Homer’s The Odyssey and it has animated seekers as varied as Jesus and the Buddha, Moses and Mohammed. The power of purpose is woven just as deeply through modern popular culture, in movies ranging from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which retells the story of Perceval’s search for the Holy Grail through the swashbuckling character of Indiana Jones; to the Star Wars trilogy, in which Luke Skywalker faces down his own deepest fears by overcoming Darth Vader and the Evil Empire and rescuing Princess Leia. It is no accident that these movies, deftly plying the archetypal themes of the search for meaning and the triumph of good over evil, are among the most successful of all time.

每一种文化自诞生起，探寻使命和意义就是最广泛也最持久的主题。早期的故事中，荷马的《奥德赛》就渗透了这样的概念，此后探索者化为耶稣、佛祖、摩西和穆罕默德等。探寻使命也同样深刻地渗入现代流行文化。《夺宝奇兵3之圣战骑兵》重新讲述了珀西瓦尔用印第安纳·琼斯的身份追寻圣杯的故事，《星球大战》三部曲里，天行者卢克打倒了自己最深的恐惧，战胜了黑武士和邪恶帝国，救出了莉亚公主。这些电影娴熟地采用了探寻使命、正义战胜邪恶的典型论题，成为长盛不衰的经典巨作。

The philosopher and mythologist Joseph Campbell described the search for meaning and purpose as “The Hero’s Journey.” The basic elements of the path, he argued, recur across cultures and throughout history. Self-transformation, Campbell said, is our greatest challenge as human beings. The hero’s journey begins when something awakens us to the need for change—illumination, discomfort, pain. Campbell described this as the “Call to Adventure.” Once we accept the call, he said, we push forward into the unknown. Along the way we face doubt, uncertainty, fear and hardship. At some point, we realize that we cannot make the journey alone, and we seek help from a “mentor.”

哲学家和神话学者约瑟夫·坎贝尔将探寻使命和目标的过程称作“英雄之旅”，其基本元素在诸多文化和历史长河中熠熠发光。坎贝尔说，自我改造是人类最大的挑战。当改变的需求被唤醒，就成为英雄之旅的开端——启示、不适和痛苦。坎贝尔将它描述为“冒险的召唤”。一旦接受了召唤，我们就踏入了未知的领域，面临怀疑、不确定、恐惧和困境的磨难。有时，我们会意识到自己无法独自完成“英雄之旅”，这时便需要寻求精神导师的帮助。

A series of tests push us to the brink of giving up, but in the “Supreme Ordeal” we finally slay the dragon—facing down the darkness within ourselves, calling on previously untapped potentials and creating meaning where it did not previously exist. We celebrate and acknowledge this accomplishment, but the process does not end there. Living out our purpose is a lifelong challenge. The journey continues and the true hero is always awaiting the next call to adventure. From the perspective of our program, the hero’s journey is grounded in mobilizing, nurturing and regularly renewing our most precious resource—energy—in the service of what matters most. We are all facing extraordinary demands in extraordinary times. Few of us are satisfied to be ordinary—in our work, our marriages, as parents, as children to aging parents and as contributors to our communities. Ordinary is not enough. We want more from ourselves and others need more from us, whether it is our employers, our spouses, our children, our parents or our fellow citizens. In each of these situations, we want to be the best we can possibly be.

许多考验都会将我们逼至放弃的边缘，但在“终极考验”中我们会手刃巨龙——直面内心的黑暗，召集未曾发掘的潜能，创造人生的意义。我们会为取得的成就欢欣鼓舞，但英雄之旅并不会到此为止。不负使命是贯穿终生的挑战。旅途仍在继续，真正的英雄永远在等待下一次冒险的召唤。从培训角度看，英雄之旅的意义在于调动、培养和定期更新宝贵的精力，支持我们完成人生最重要的任务。时势造英雄，不管是工作还是婚姻，作为父母还是子女，很少有人愿意甘于平庸，因为平庸低于我们对自己的要求；雇主、配偶、孩子、父母或者同胞，他人对我们也有更高的期望。我们希望自己在每个角色中都做到最好。

Unfortunately, most of us do not pursue the hero’s path. The simple, almost embarrassing reality is that we feel too busy to search for meaning. Who has the time and the energy to actively pursue a deeper purpose? Instead, like Roger B., many of us sleepwalk through our lives, operating on automatic pilot most of the time. We meet our obligations but rarely question whether we could be reaching for something more. When we first asked Roger to describe what gave his life meaning, he hemmed and hawed and finally resorted to generalities and platitudes. “Taking care of my family,” he said, and “being successful in my work.” The truth, Roger acknowledged, was that he simply - didn’t feel any passion about anything.

不幸的是，多数人从未踏上过英雄征途。原因说起来简单却令人难堪：我们太过忙碌，无暇追寻生命的意义。谁有时间和精力挖掘生活的使命呢？像罗杰一样的人有许多，过日子像梦游，大多数时间都是自动驾驶模式。我们会做好自己的义务，却很少深入探究是否能够达到更高的意义。还记得我们第一次让罗杰描述生活的意义时，他支支吾吾好久，最终只能求助于万能答案。“照顾家人，事业成功。”罗杰承认，其实他对任何事情都没有激情。

Several years ago, the city of Orlando, Florida, planted a long line of trees along the highway that leads to our training center. The first time there was a storm with heavy winds, nearly every tree was blown down. The city dutifully sent workers to prop the trees back up. They secured them with baling wire and other external sources of support. It did no good. When the next storm came, the trees were blown over again. Over the next year, the same scenario repeated itself a half dozen times, despite a series of strategies to prop the trees back up.

几年前，佛罗里达州奥兰多市在高速路旁栽下一排树苗，一直通到我们的训练中心。第一次暴风雨来临时，几乎所有树都被吹倒了。市政厅很尽责地安排工人把树扶起来，用成捆的铁丝木料重新固定。第二次暴风雨来了，树又被刮倒了。在接下来的一年里，倒和扶的循环反复了好几次，无论工人们使用何种方法固定树干，结果都是徒劳无功。

It never seemed to occur to the folks in charge that if trees are to survive in a high-wind area, they must have a deeper root structure. It did occur to us that we were observing in nature a phenomenon that characterizes many of our own lives. Because we so often lack deep roots—firm beliefs and compelling values—we are easily buffeted by the prevailing winds. If we lack a strong sense of purpose we cannot hold our ground when we are challenged by life’s inevitable storms. Instead, like Roger, we react defensively, blaming the storm or simply disengaging and ceasing to invest our energy. “You can work long hours but still be slothful,” writes Joanne Ciulla, author of The Working Life. “The things that keep us from finding meaning are failure to actively engage in life and a certain laziness or lack of caring that allows us to let others make our decisions and tell us what things mean.”

植树项目的负责人似乎没有想过，树木若要在强风地区存活，一定要把根扎深。这也是生活在自然中的写照。因为我们的根基薄弱——缺乏信仰和坚定的价值观，因而很容易被生活的狂风推来搡去。面对生活无常的挑战，如果我们缺乏使命感，便无法站稳脚跟；要么像罗杰一样，抱怨风雨，自我戒备，不再专注，或者干脆停止投入精力。“即使长时间工作，你也可能依旧懒散，”《工作生涯》的作者乔安·席拉写道，“不能积极投入阻碍了我们探寻意义，懒惰和缺乏关爱之心，让我们允许他人代做决定，告诉我们意义何在。”

## MEASURING THE POWER OF PURPOSE

**Purpose is a unique source of energy and power**. As we suggested earlier, **it fuels focus, direction, passion and perseverance**. To get a quick sense of the power of your own purpose, take out your pen and paper and spend a few moments answering the following three questions, using a scale of 1 to 10.

人生目标是一种独特的精力源。正如我们之前所说，人生目标会带来专注、目标感、激情和恒心。为了快速了解自己的生命意义，请拿出笔和纸回答以下3个问题，分别从1到10进行打分。

* How excited are you to get to work in the morning?<br/>每天早晨上班时你的兴奋度是多少？
* How much do you enjoy what you do for its own sake rather than for what it gets you?<br/>享受做事有多大程度是因为事情本身而非它带来的回报？
* How accountable do you hold yourself to a deeply held set of values?<br/>你认为自己对价值取向负有多大的责任？

If the answers to these questions total 27 or more, it suggests that you already bring a significant sense of purpose to what you do. If your answers fall below 22, you are more likely going through the motions. The issue is not so much whether your life is providing you with a sense of meaning as it is whether you are actively using life as a vehicle through which to express your deepest values. As Viktor Frankl puts it: “Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.”

如果3道问题的总分达到27分以上，说明你已经带着强烈的人生目标生活了。如果总分在22分以下，说明你的生活只是走过场。问题的关键并非在于生活赋予你怎样的意义，而在于你是否主动将生活变成自己价值取向的载体。正如维克多·弗兰克尔所说的：“毕竟，人类不应该询问生活的意义，因为他自己才是需要做出回答的人。每个人都要接受生活的质询。他只能为自己的生活作答，并负起相应的责任。”

There are many levels of spiritual development, much as there are sequential levels of physical, emotional and mental development. Religion professor Wade Roofs has defined spirituality as “knowing our deepest selves and what is sacred to us.” We start at this most basic level because we have found that it has both universality and great utility. Powerful transformations occur for our clients when they are able to shift their focus from filling deficits to cultivating deeper values and defining a vision for themselves. As the tennis player Arthur Ashe once put it: “From what we get in life, we make a living. From what we give, we make a life.”

意志的发展有许多层面，正如体能、情感和思维发展也有许多层面一样。宗教学教授韦德·鲁弗斯将灵性定义为“了解最深层的自己和最珍视的事物”。这项定义放之四海皆准，并且可以灵活调用。当客户的精力从弥补过失转向培养价值观、为自己树立目标时，他们的生活才有可能发生巨大的改变。正如网球选手阿什所说：“我们依生活所赐而谋生，依己之付出而生活。”

When Andy L. came to see us late in 2001, he had lost his way. The president and CEO of a large real estate development company, he felt completely disengaged at work. “I had been through a series of health challenges, and the medication regime had left me feeling bloated and sluggish,” he explained, “but really these were symptoms of something bigger. For nearly all my life, I felt passionate about my work. Then I ran into some difficult management issues, and I had some frustrating setbacks. It got to the point that I didn’t even care about getting up to go to work in the morning. I was deep into victim mode and I needed a lifeline.”

安迪在2001年底找到我们。作为一家大型房地产公司的总裁和CEO，他感到自己完全游离在工作之外。“我之前出过一些健康方面的问题，药物让我感觉肿胀迟缓，但这都不是最严重的。我毕生都对工作充满热情，后来我遇到了些管理的难题，让我倍感挫折，灰心丧气，连早起工作都失去了意义。我觉得自己成了受害者，需要一条救生索。”

Defining what mattered to him most created a breakthrough for Andy. He settled on five key values—**persistence**, **integrity**, **excellence**, **creativity** and **commitment**. They became his touchstone—and the source of his motivation for change.

审视自己最珍视的品质给安迪带来了突破口。他列举了5条重要品质——恒心、正直、卓越、创新和投入。它们成为他改变的原动力和衡量改变的标准。

“All day, every day, whether I’m at work or I’m exercising or I’m with my family, I ask myself if what I’m doing is serving my values,” Andy explains. “If my motivation for exercising hard had been fitting into the pants that I wore two years ago, that would have worked for a while, but it wouldn’t have lasted. When I’m on the treadmill now and I feel like getting off, what I think about is persistence, integrity and commitment. Without linking up to those values, I’d be asking myself “Why the hell am I doing this?” and I’d probably quit. Andy brings a similar thought process to his eating habits. In the first two months after working with us, he lost thirty-two pounds. Between working out and losing weight, his energy increased dramatically.

“每一天，不管是工作、锻炼还是陪伴家人，我都会问自己正在做的事情是否符合这5条品质。”安迪说。“如果我健身的理由是穿上两年前尺码的裤子，可能在最开始会有效果，但不会长久。而现在，当我在跑步机上想停下来的时候，我会想到恒心、正直和投入。如果没有这些信念支撑我，我肯定会想‘我在这儿干嘛’，然后放弃。”安迪把类似的调整也带入了饮食习惯。两个月之后，安迪成功减重32磅。因为健身和减重，他的精力水平也产生了质的飞跃。

Andy called on the fuel of purpose very directly at work. “When I’m on the job,” he explains, “I’m asking myself ‘Am I generating the kind of leadership, providing direction, setting strategy and responding to the marketplace in a way that is reflective of my five key values?’ For me the values create a very simple mirror. They keep me on purpose, and they renew me when I find myself wandering off course. My sense of commitment is way up, and I’m communicating that energy to others. I’m leaping out of bed in the mornings. I have absolutely retaken responsibility for the results of my company. I’m leading with purpose, which I wasn’t doing before.”

安迪在工作时也搬出了这些品质。“工作中，我会问自己‘我在领导员工、制定方向和战略、回应市场时，是否反应出了这些重要品质？’对我来说，它们好似一面镜子，让我始终明白生命的意义，在我走入歧途时把我拉回正轨。我的使命意识增强了，我也在把这种精力传递给其他人。早晨醒来后我会一跃而起。我已经完全承担起公司的责任。现在是生活的目的引领着我前进，这是以前从未发生过的事情。”

## POSITIVE PURPOSE

Purpose becomes a more powerful and enduring source of energy in our lives in three ways: when its source moves from **negative to positive**, **external to internal** and **self to others**.

当目标感从消极流向积极、从外部流向内部、从自己流向他人，它就成为生活中最强大也最持久的精力源。

A negative source of purpose is defensive and deficit-based. It arises in the face of threat—physical or psychological. When we feel our security and survival are at stake, emotions such as fear, anger and even hatred can be a powerful source of energy. The problem is the cost. As we saw earlier, negative emotions drain energy and prompt the release of hormones that are toxic to our systems over time.

消极的目标充满防备心理，它的本质基于缺陷，诞生于身体威胁或心理威胁。当我们感到安全和生存受到威胁，恐惧、愤怒甚至憎恶的情感都是可以调用的强大力量，却代价不菲。正如我们之前提到过的，负面情感容易耗尽精力，还会释放出对人体长期有害的荷尔蒙。

Purpose fueled by the feeling of deficit also narrows our attention and limits our possibilities. Imagine, for a moment, that you are out on the sea in a boat that springs a leak. Your purpose immediately becomes mobilized around keeping the boat from sinking. But so long as you are busy bailing water, you can’t navigate towards a destination. The same is true in our lives. When we are preoccupied with filling our own holes to stay afloat, we have little energy available to define any deeper or more enduring purpose. By contrast, when we are able to move from the inner experience of threat to one of challenge, we introduce a whole new range of possibilities into our lives. Rather than reacting to fear, we can focus on what moves us and feels meaningful.

因为缺陷产生的目的也会限制我们的视野。设想一下，如果你坐在一艘行驶在海上的小船里，船底突然开始漏水，你的目的肯定是阻止小船沉下去。但如果你一直忙着舀水，肯定无暇顾及小船的航向。生活也是如此。当我们忙着填补漏洞，不让自己沉底，就没有多余精力探寻更深层的意义了。换句话说，如果我们能够将注意力从内心的威胁经历转移到挑战上去，就为生活开启了一系列全新的可能性。我们的生存动机不再是恐惧，而是可以引导我们、赋予我们意义的事物。

Janet R. is a highly driven senior executive at a large New York City media company. By her own description, she brought to her work a fierce commitment to excellence. She saw this as a primary value in her life, and she felt that it had helped her to rise steadily up the corporate ladder. As with Roger B., a somewhat different picture emerged when we began to look beneath the surface in her life. The feedback Janet received from colleagues on her Full Engagement Inventory indicated that while they did indeed see her as committed, focused and intelligent, they also found her to be highly controlling and defensive.

珍妮特是纽约一家大型媒体公司的高管，她认为自己总是带着追求卓越的使命感工作。她将追求卓越看作人生的首要价值，认为这种品质帮助自己在公司里稳步晋升。但是，和罗杰一样，当我们开始深入了解她的生活，看到的却是一幅不太相同的图景。珍妮特的同事在问卷调查中做出反馈，他们承认她投入、专注、聪明，同时评价她具有极强的控制欲和防备心。

Janet found this feedback painful but also provocative. She had always assumed that she derived purpose from her commitment to excellence. At the same time, she acknowledged that she took very little pleasure in work well done. At best, she felt a brief sense of relief and then a renewed anxiety about the next challenge. What really drove her, she realized, was a fierce hunger to avoid mistakes. Even small ones, she said, made her feel vulnerable to criticism—her own and that of others. The consequence was that Janet lived in a state of narrowly focused attention, forever zeroing in on the potential for failure. Physically, the toll showed up in headaches and lower back pain. Emotionally, Janet lived in a state of tension that robbed her of energy and enthusiasm, and antagonized her colleagues. Mentally, her obsession with getting everything right compromised her willingness to take risks and to exercise much creativity.

这样的评价令珍妮特痛苦又让她振作。她一直以为，自己的动力来源于对卓越的追求，但她承认，自己从工作中并没有得到相应的乐趣，最多算是短暂的轻松，而轻松过后就会担忧起下一次挑战。她意识到，自己真正的动力是避免出错，即使很小的失误也让她感到无地自容，害怕受到自己和他人的批判。结果，珍妮特的视野过于狭隘，眼中只有失败的可能性。在身体层面，她开始出现头痛、腰痛的症状；情感层面，持续的紧张感耗尽了她的精力和热情，招来了同事的怨气；思维层面，求全责备的心态损害了她的冒险意识和创造力。

As Janet explored her motivation more deeply, she realized that she had turned her commitment to excellence into a form of tyranny, and that her perfectionism had a devastating energy consequence—in her own life and on others. When she began to explore her values more deeply, she realized that she especially admired kindness and humility in others and wished that she could better embody these qualities in her own life.

当珍妮特进一步分析自己的动力时，她发现，追求卓越的心理已经演变成一种暴力，完美主义的心态给自己和他人的生活造成了破坏性的影响。在树立价值取向的过程中，她说自己特别欣赏他人身上的善良和谦逊，希望自己也能拥有这些品质。

Janet decided to institute a ritual of revisiting her primary values every morning. By learning to balance a continuing positive passion for excellence with a newfound commitment to humility and concern for others, she began to tap into a more positive and less costly source of spiritual energy.

珍妮特决定每天早晨都用自己的首要价值取向提醒自己，一面积极追求卓越，一面不忘谦逊、为他人着想。她很快就拥有了更加积极、代价更小的意志精力源。

“I started to see how much I viewed the world as an enemy I was always fighting against,” Janet told us. “It also occurred to me that I didn’t always have all the answers. Changing my outlook has been one of the toughest challenges I’ve ever taken on, but connecting to the values of kindness and humility has been like taking a close friend along on the journey. I still don’t like being wrong, but I see now that’s it’s not the end of the world. Sometimes it’s more important to stay connected with people than to be right.”

“我开始意识到，之前我一直把世界当作假想敌，”珍妮特告诉我们，“我也明白了自己并非全知全能。改变观点是我目前最大的挑战，幸好善良和谦逊与我为伴。我仍然不喜欢犯错，只不过我现在明白，犯错并不是世界末日。有时候，与他人交流比观点正确更为重要。”

## INTRINSIC PURPOSE

Purpose also becomes a more powerful source of energy when it moves from being externally to internally motivated. Extrinsic motivation reflects the desire to get more of something that we don’t feel we have enough of: money, approval, social standing, power or even love. “Intrinsic” motivation grows out of the desire to engage in an activity because we value it for the inherent satisfaction it provides. Researchers have long found that intrinsic motivation tends to prompt more sustaining energy. A study conducted by the University of Rochester’s Human Motivation Research Group found, for example, that people whose motivation was authentic—defined as “self-authored”—exhibited more interest, excitement and confidence, as well as greater persistence, creativity and performance than a control group of subjects who were motivated largely by external demands and rewards.

当目的从外部转移到内心，也能提供强大的精力。外在动机反映了我们对某种事物得不到满足而产生的欲望——金钱、认同感、社会地位、权力甚至爱情。而内在动机则来源于对事物本身的兴趣，它的价值在于给我们带来内心的满足感。很久以前研究人员就发现内在动机能够提供更加持久的精力。罗彻斯特大学人类动机研究组发现，相比于基本只受到外在激励的变量组，实验组一旦拥有了自发产生的“真正”动机，就会表现出更有兴趣，更高昂也更自信的一面，也会表现出更多恒心和创造力。

Nowhere are the limits of an external source of purpose so clear as with money. While money serves as a primary source of motivation and an ongoing preoccupation for many of us, researchers have found almost no correlation between income levels and happiness. Between 1957 and 1990, per person income in the United States doubled, taking into account inflation. Not only did people’s reported levels of happiness fail to increase at all during the same period, but rates of depression grow nearly tenfold. The incidence of divorce, suicide, alcoholism and drug abuse also rose dramatically.

没有什么外部激励的限制比金钱的动机限制更加直观。即使金钱是大多数人的首要激励条件，研究者却并未发现收入水平与幸福的直接联系。从1957年到1990年，美国的人均收入翻了一番（通货膨胀已计入），而幸福指数却没有丝毫提升，抑郁率反而升高了10倍。离婚、自杀、嗜酒和药物滥用的数字都有巨幅增长。

“We humans need food, rest, warmth and social contact,” writes David Myers, author of The Pursuit of Happiness. “For starving Sudanese and homeless Iraqis money would buy more happiness. But having more than enough provides little additional boost to well being. . . . Once we’re comfortable, more money therefore provides diminishing returns. . . . The correlation between income and happiness is modest, and in both the U.S. and Canada [it] has now dropped to near zero. . . . Income also doesn’t noticeably influence satisfaction with marriage, family, friendship or ourselves—all of which do predict a sense of well being.” Happiness, in turn, has been clearly associated with higher productivity. In short, money may not buy happiness, but happiness may help you get rich.

“人类需要食物、休息、温暖和人际交往，”大卫·迈尔斯在《追求幸福》一书中写道，“对于饥饿的苏丹人和无家可归的伊拉克人来说，金钱可以的确买到更多幸福；但是超出基本需求之后，金钱对于幸福影响微乎其微……一旦我们跨入舒适的边界，金钱带来的满足感也减小了……收入和幸福之间的关系几乎可以忽略不计，在美国和加拿大尤为如此……收入也不会大幅影响人们对婚姻、家庭、友谊或自身的满意度，而这些条件都是幸福的指标。”而幸福与效能息息相关。一言以蔽之，金钱或许买不到幸福，幸福却能帮你变得富裕。

**Extrinsic rewards have actually been shown to undermine intrinsic motivation**. Researchers Mark R. Lepper and David R. Green spent time watching nursery school children at play in order to assess what they most enjoyed doing. Next, they began giving each child a reward each time he or she engaged in the preferred activity. Across the board, the children’s interest in activities quickly diminished when they were associated with rewards. In a second study, adults doing puzzles were rewarded each time they were successful in completing them. Like the children, their interest in continuing the activity progressively decreased. Plainly, people can be motivated by material gain and by external praise. The point is that **we feel more passion for and derive more pleasure from doing what we freely choose and most enjoy**.

外在激励实际上会损害内在激励。研究员马克·莱珀和大卫·格林观察了一群幼儿园的孩子玩耍，分别确定他们最喜欢的活动。每当孩子们做自己喜欢的游戏时，研究员都会奖励他们。孩子们的兴趣一旦与外部奖励联系起来，很快就全面消退了。在另外一项研究里，成年人每次完成拼图都会受到奖励。结果，像孩子们一样，他们对于拼图的兴趣也持续下降。很显然，人们可以被物质奖励或外部激励所驱使；但是，只有在自由选择并享受事物本身的情况下人们才会表现出更多热情，从中获得更多乐趣。

James D. was a senior executive in corporate communications for more than twenty years. He was well paid, and his job had allowed him and his wife to buy a large house that they loved, to live very comfortably, to take luxurious vacations and to put their three children through private school. James found his work intellectually challenging, but he never felt inspired or excited by it. The rewards he derived were almost all external. As he moved into his late forties, he hungered for something more. When he began to define his purpose, it became clear that what gave him the deepest sense of satisfaction was teaching—and learning. His happiest memories were from college and graduate school, when he pursued learning for its own sake.

詹姆斯是某企业公关部门的高管，从业20多年。由于待遇优厚，他和妻子得以买下心爱的大宅，生活条件愈加舒适，时常有机会享受奢侈的度假， 3个孩子都在读私立学校。詹姆斯的工作很考验思维，但他从未在工作中迸发灵感，也不曾因为工作而情绪高昂。公司给予的回报几乎都是外部奖励。当接近知天命的年龄阶段，詹姆斯开始渴望获得更多东西。在寻找人生目标的过程中，他发现，传授知识和学习知识能带给他最深的满足感。他最开心的时光是大学和研究生时期，那时他可以纯粹为了学习而学习。

The first change that James made was to get a part-time position teaching a communications course at a local university without giving up his day job. Six months later, he was offered the opportunity to take over the university’s public information department, while continuing to teach there. It meant taking a pay cut of more than 60 percent, but James didn’t hesitate. He quit his corporate job. By this point, his wife had decided to return to work herself, and that helped to ease the loss of income.

于是，詹姆斯踏出了改变的第一步，他在白天做自己的本职工作，晚上在当地大学兼职教传播学课程。 6个月后，大学邀请他管理公共信息系，并继续教学工作。新职位的薪水只有现在的40%，但詹姆斯毫不犹豫地答应了。他辞去了公司里的工作，此时，妻子也决定重返职场，这样就弥补了部分收入缺口。

For the first year, James took on an occasional freelance consulting job to supplement their income, and they dipped into savings to cover the difference between their costs and their expenses. In the second year, without even thinking much about it, they began to cut back, especially on luxuries, and James gave up the freelancing, which he had done only halfheartedly.

头一年，詹姆斯偶尔也做自由咨询来补充收入，夫妻俩开始注重储蓄，保持收支平衡。第二年，他们开始削减不必要的开支，尤其是奢侈品方面。詹姆斯也放弃了之前的自由职业，因为他做起来都是半心半意的。

During his corporate career, James had spent considerable time worrying about money, even as his income steadily increased. In his new life he found that he spent very little time thinking about money at all. With their two youngest kids in college, he and his wife decided to sell their large house, move into a smaller one and cut their expenses still further. James spent fewer hours actually working at his new job than he had in his corporate life. Nonetheless, fueled by a passionate sense of purpose, he was far more efficient and productive than he had ever been before. He also found that he had time to begin a part-time graduate program in history, an interest that he had given up in college as unlikely to lead to a good living. One of the perks of his new job was the opportunity to take courses at no cost.

在之前的职业生涯里，即使收入一直稳步增长，詹姆斯总是很担心钱。到了生活的新阶段，他几乎不再考虑到金钱的问题。最小的两个孩子都读大学了，于是他和妻子决定卖掉大房子，搬进一栋小一点的房子，更大幅度减少了支出。现在的工作时长实际上比之前的短，然而，因为他满怀热情和使命感，工作效率达到了前所未有的高度。他还发现，他有了空余时间，可以参加一个非全日制的历史学研究课程。历史曾是他大学时期的兴趣，后来因为不太可能获得丰厚收入而放弃了。而恰好新工作的福利之一就是可以免费参加该项课程。

## A PURPOSE BEYOND ONE’S SELF

The third factor that ignites a deeper sense of purpose is shifting attention from fulfilling our own needs and desires to serving something beyond ourselves. Undeniably, people will work hard to get rich or famous or to win more admiration. But to what lengths will they go to achieve such goals? It is not uncommon for people to put their lives at risk in the service of causes they deeply believe in. Soldiers do so regularly in war. New York City firemen did so when they entered the towers of the World Trade Center in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on 9/11. Just think for a moment about a doctor who is motivated primarily by money, compared with one whose sense of purpose comes from the desire to be a healer and to serve his patients with excellence. The doctor who is looking to maximize his income might make very different decisions than one whose primary focus is the quality of the care that he provides to patients. Given equal skills, which one would you prefer to have care for you in a life-or-death situation?

点燃深度人生目标的第三步，就是将目标设定从满足自我需求变为超越个人利益。不可否认，人们会想方设法变得富裕、知名，或者受到更多关注。但是人们愿意为这些目标付出的极限在哪里？因为价值信仰不顾生命危险的案例不胜枚举，士兵在战场上通常如此，“9·11事件”中踏入浓烟滚滚的世贸中心的纽约消防员也做出了同样的选择。想想一个场景，一名被金钱驱使的医生，与一名医者仁心、精益求精的医生，面对同一位病人，一心想增加收入的医生和关注病人得到照顾的医生可能会做出完全相反的决策。如果两人医术相当，你更希望哪位医生在生死关头主宰你的命运？

“Work makes life better,” writes Joanne Ciulla, author of The Working Life, “if it helps others; alleviates suffering; eliminates difficult or tedious toil; makes someone healthier and happier; or aesthetically or intellectually enriches people and improves the environment in which we live.” Many of our clients blame their work environments for their unhappiness and their absence of passion. But it is not necessarily the nature of the job that determines how meaningful and motivating it is. The challenge we all face is to find ways to use the workplace as a forum in which to express and embody our deepest values. We can derive a sense of purpose, for example, from mentoring others, or being part of a cohesive team, or simply from a commitment to treating others with respect and care and from communicating positive energy. The real measure of our lives may ultimately be in the small choices we make in each and every moment.

“工作让生活变得更好，”乔安·席拉在《工作生涯》中写道，“如果工作的内容是帮助他人、减轻痛苦，让我们变得健康和幸福；或者它能从美感、智力方面丰富内心，改善我们生活的环境。”很多客户因为自己不幸福、缺乏激情，而责怪工作环境，但是工作的本质并不决定意义和激励。所有人都需要通过自身努力将工作场所变成传递和培养深层价值观的土壤，比如指导他人，增加团队凝聚力等，或仅仅是尊重他人、关心他人，交流积极精力等等。我们每时每刻做出的微小选择才是衡量生活的真正标准。

Clarifying purpose takes time—quiet, uninterrupted time—which is something that many of us feel we simply do not have. We are forever rushing from one obligation to the next without any larger sense of direction. It seems almost self-indulgent to spend time on questions of meaning and purpose. It may help to think of energy devoted to these issues as an investment with the potential to deliver a high return over time—increased energy, fuller engagement, higher productivity and greater satisfaction.

明确人生目标需要时间，安静、不被干扰的时间，许多人恰巧缺乏这样的条件。我们总是在各种任务之间疲于奔命，找不到方向。花时间思考意义和目标几乎变成一种奢侈和任性。而投入的精力恰恰是一项具有潜在回报的投资——精力水平提升、专注力增强、高效产出以及深深的满足感。

So long as we skim across the surface of our lives at high speeds, it is impossible to dig down more deeply. People cannot move horizontally and vertically at the same time. When clients come through our program, one of our aims is to help them slow down, to put aside their preoccupations and their pressing demands for long enough to step back and take a look at the choices they are making. It is no coincidence that every enduring spiritual tradition has emphasized practices such as prayer, retreat, contemplation and meditation—all means by which to quietly connect with and regularly revisit what matters most. You might begin your own inquiry very simply by giving some thought to the following question: “Is the life I am living worth what I am giving up to have it?”

如果我们还是流连于快节奏生活的表面，就无法进行深度挖掘。事物不能同时在水平和垂直方向上移动。与客户合作的过程中，我们的一个目标就是帮助他们放慢脚步，放下心头盘旋的焦虑和压力，直到能够站在一旁仔细评估自己做出的每个决定。所有长期存在精神传统意识都强调祷告、抽离、沉思和冥想，在安静的氛围里回归内心最珍贵的所在，这并非偶然。你可以从思考一个简单的问题开始：“我现在的生活是否值得我曾为之放弃的一切？”

## VALUES AND VIRTUES

Deeply held values fuel the energy on which purpose is built. They define an enduring code of conduct—the rules of engagement in the journey to bring our vision for ourselves to life. The pursuit of power or wealth or fame may all be a sources of motivation, but these goals are external and often fill deficiency needs rather than serving growth and transformation. We may value crushing our enemies, or amassing more money than our neighbors, or achieving social standing and prestige. But these are not values as we define them in our work with clients. Values, we believe, have intrinsic worth. They provide a source of inspiration and meaning that cannot be taken away from us.

人生目标扎根于精力，而深层价值取向可以提供精力。这是一种持久的行为模式——实现自我愿景的旅程中遵循的“投入法则”。对于权力、财富或名利的追求或许都算作动机，但这些事物都属于外部激励，是为了满足某种缺陷而非为个体带来成长或转变。人们或许很看重自己能否打败敌人、挣得比邻居多、获得上流社会地位或特权，但这些并不能成为我们要客户寻找的价值取向。我们相信价值自有其内在意义。它们可以激发灵感、丰富生活，这是任何人、任何事都不能影响的。

Across cultures, religions and time itself, people have admired and aspired to the same universal values—among them **integrity**, **generosity**, **courage**, **humility**, **compassion**, **loyalty**, **perseverance**—while rejecting their opposites—**deceit**, **greed**, **cowardice**, **arrogance**, **callousness**, **disloyalty** and **sloth**. To begin to explore more deeply the values that are most compelling to you, we suggest that you set aside uninterrupted time to respond to the following questions:

纵观不同的文化、宗教和时代，大众普遍推崇的价值观始终如一——正直、慷慨、勇气、谦逊、怜悯、忠诚、恒心，其对立面也同样遭人唾弃——欺骗、贪婪、怯懦、傲慢、无情、不忠和怠惰。为了找到内心最坚定的价值取向，我们建议你留出一段不受干扰的时间，回答以下问题：

* Jump ahead to the end of your life. What are the three most important lessons you have learned and why are they so critical? 如果现在就是人生的尽头，你学到的最重要的3件事是什么？为什么它们如此重要？

* Think of someone that you deeply respect. Describe three qualities in this person that you most admire. 想想你最敬重的一个人，描述他/她身上你最钦佩的3种品质。

* Who are you at your best? 你能做到的最好的自己是什么样的？

* What one-sentence inscription would you like to see on your tombstone that would capture who you really were in your life? 你希望你的墓志铭如何总结你的人生？

Each of these questions is a means of surfacing the values that will define your “rules of engagement” in whatever mission you are on. What matters most to you will be revealed in the life lessons that you consider most important, in the qualities that you most admire in another person, and perhaps above all in your description of who you are at your best. The accompanying Deepest Values Checklist includes a list of commonly held values. It is simply a set of suggestions. Add to it any other values that you consider important. Our goal is to help you begin to identify which ones are most motivating to you personally.

每一道问题都是帮你寻找深层价值取向的工具。这些价值观会决定你“投入的法则”。对你最重要的事会反映在你最看重的人生课程中，你最钦佩的他人品质中，尤其是你对自己的最高期望里。下面的“深层价值取向清单”列举了一些最普遍的价值取向，仅作参考。你也可以加入其他条目，最终目标是找到最能激励你的价值观。

A value is ultimately just a roadmap for action. Values that we fail to reflect in our behavior are ultimately empty. To be meaningful, a value must influence the choices that we make in our everyday lives. Professing one set of beliefs and living by another is not just hypocritical, but also evidence of disconnection and misalignment. The more we are committed to and guided by our values, the more powerful a source of energy they become.

价值观是终极的行为指南。不符行为的价值观只是空话，它们必须足以影响一个人每天做出的决定，才有意义。说一套做一套不仅是伪善的表现，还代表人格的断层和失调。我们价值观越坚定、越受其引导，它越能为我们提供强有力的精力。

A value in action is a virtue.

体现在行为中的价值观才是美德。

We may hold generosity as a value, but the virtue is behaving generously. Alignment occurs when we transform our values into virtues. Simply identifying our primary values is not sufficient. The next step is to define more precisely how we intend to embody the values in our daily lives—regardless of external pressures. For example: “I demonstrate the value of generosity by investing energy in others, without expectation that I will receive anything in return, and by my willingness to put the agendas of those I care about ahead of my own, even if it means inconveniencing myself at times.”

我们可以将慷慨作为价值观，但行事大方才是美德。合力作用在我们将价值观转换成美德的时候才会出现。只认识到我们的首要价值取向是不够的，接下来需要细致规划如何将其融入日常生活，并且不惧外界阻力。譬如：“为了实践慷慨，我会花精力关心他人、不求回报，自愿将我关心的人的事情安排在自己之前，即使有时会给自己带来不便。”

Too often our motivation for a behavior is expedient rather than value driven. We do what makes us feel good in the moment or fills a hole or lessens our pain. If you are feeling anxious, the expedient energy choice may be to eat a chocolate chip cookie or smoke a cigarette or drink a couple of beers to salve the discomfort. If you are rushing to meet a pressing deadline for an important project, the expedient choice might be to raise your voice and order people around. If you make a mistake that is going to get you in trouble, you may disclaim responsibility and blame others.

我们通常的行为都是权宜之计，并非由价值观推动。我们选择此刻让我们感到舒适的做法，或者暂时填补空缺、减轻痛苦。感到焦虑时，应急行为可能是吃巧克力饼干、抽烟或喝几杯啤酒。如果某个重要项目的截止日期正在逼近，应急行为可能是提高嗓门，对下属呼来喝去。如果犯下招致麻烦的错误，你或许会选择推脱责任，归咎他人。

Values hold us to a different standard for managing energy.

价值会影响精力管理的标准。

If you have identified self-care as a value, you may resist the lure of a cookie or a cigarette or a drink. If you value respect for others, you may feel impelled to exercise self-control even when you are under pressure. If you hold integrity as a key value, you will more likely take responsibility for a mistake even if it means incurring criticism. It is relatively easy to act in accord with our values when we are feeling comfortable and secure. The real test is when **virtuous behavior demands that we resist instant gratification and make sacrifices**. **It is in these situations that values serve us best, both as a source of energy and as a code of conduct**.

如果你看重自身健康，或许可以抵抗饼干、香烟和酒精的诱惑；如果你尊重他人，即使身处压力之下也会表现出自控；如果你看重正直的品格，则更有可能承担犯错的责任。在舒适安全的环境下，按照价值观行事相对容易。真正的试炼出现在需要我们抵抗片刻欢愉、付出乃至牺牲的时刻。此时，价值的意义才会真正凸显，它不仅是行为的准则，也是所有精力的来源。

## WALKING THE TALK

Think back for a moment to Barry F., the CEO who told us that respect for others was his primary value, but whose direct reports told us that he regularly kept them waiting. It was only when he connected his value to his behavior that he recognized the disconnection and felt compelled to make a change. Much the same was true for Michael D., the investment adviser who decided to take a stand and sell his positions, even at the risk of losing clients. Only when he identified integrity and concern for others as deep values in his life did he feel compelled to take action and change his long-standing behavior.

我们来回顾一下巴里的案例（参见138页）。他告诉我们，自己的首要价值观是尊重他人，然而直接下属却抱怨他总是让他们等待。只有当他把二者结合起来时，才看到自己言语和行为的断层，意识到自己必须改变。迈克尔也是如此（参见144页），这个卖掉股票表明立场的投资顾问也是在重拾正直、关心他人的价值观后，才决心改变自己长期以来的行为。

Values-based behavior doesn’t invariably lead to greater financial rewards. Nonetheless Jim Collins makes a compelling case, in his book Built to Last, that values-driven companies do indeed perform better in the long run. Our own argument is simply that strongly held values drive fuller engagement in all arenas of our lives. Put another way, **a values-driven life increases the likelihood that you will bring passion, commitment and perseverance to whatever it is you do**.

基于价值观的行为未必会带来更多金钱回报。即便如此，吉姆·柯林斯在《基业长青》一书中也证实，由价值观驱动的公司的长期效益更好。我们认为，有力的价值观会在各方面增加全情投入的程度。换句话说，在价值观驱动的人生中，你更有可能将激情、投入和恒心带进所有的事情。

Susan D. is an advertising executive who came to us complaining bitterly about her work environment and specifically about a boss whom she considered to be impossible to please. No matter what Susan accomplished, the boss gave her the feeling that it wasn’t enough. Over time, Susan found herself slowly disengaging, working halfheartedly and being less productive. Why invest her heart and soul, she figured, when she saw no hope of being recognized or rewarded for her efforts? Frustration and resentment consumed much of her remaining energy and the downward spiral fed on itself. As her performance suffered, she felt worse about herself. The worse that she felt, the more distracted she became.

苏珊是一位广告营销专员，她对工作环境大倒苦水，尤其是那位永远不会满意的上司。不论苏珊做出何种成绩，上司都会让她觉得还不够好。苏珊觉得自己渐渐不再投入，工作三心二意，效率降低。她这样想，如果努力得不到回报、工作不被老板认可，还有什么理由和必要付出心血呢？沮丧和怨恨消耗了她的精力，而精力低下则导致工作表现大打折扣，表现不好让她的心情更糟。她越是觉得糟糕，做事就越难集中精力。

The problem, we helped Susan to see, was that she had defined her value purely in external terms. So long as she invested energy primarily in winning her boss’s approval, she was doomed to disappointment. When she turned inward and began to explore her own deepest values, Susan found two that were especially compelling: excellence and commitment. By holding herself accountable to behaving in accord with these values she began to feel better about herself, more aligned, and more engaged. Susan remained unhappy to be in a workplace in which she felt unappreciated. But with refocused energy, her performance improved, her spirits rose and she began to look for a new job. Within two months, she located a position in a different part of the company working for a boss she liked and found inspiring.

我们让苏珊明白，她的问题在于将自己的价值完全交给外人评判。如果她投入精力的目标仅仅是为了取悦老板，结果只会是接二连三的失望。当她将注意力转向内心，挖掘深层价值观，发现自己最看重的是卓越和投入。她按照自己的价值观规范行为，心情渐渐好转。虽然身处一个不被认可的环境仍然让她苦恼，但是由于重新专注于工作，她的表现和精神状态有所好转，她决定换一个岗位。两个月后，她调入公司另一个部门，为一位她喜欢的、激励人的上司工作。

It is not always that easy. There are times when we must endure difficult bosses and stressful work environments. Even then, when we are guided by clear values, we can continue to make choices about how to behave from a position of confidence, strength and dignity rather than from anger, resentment and insecurity. In some cases, it may make sense to change our circumstances. But challenges and difficulties never disappear. In the end, we must live in concert with our values wherever we find ourselves.

事情并不总是那么简单。有时我们也不得不忍受严苛的老板和高压的工作环境。即便如此，只要我们坚持自己的价值观，仍然可以带着自信力量和尊严做出正确的选择，不被愤怒、怨恨和不安的情绪困扰。在某些时候，换个环境的确可行，不过困难和挑战并不会就此消失。归根结底，我们的行为依然需要符合自己的价值观。

## A VISION OF FULL ENGAGEMENT

The next step in defining purpose is to create a **vision** for how we intend to invest our energy. A compelling vision statement strikes a careful balance. On the one hand, **in order to provide inspiration it needs to be lofty, ambitious and even a bit overreaching**. On the other hand, **in order to have teeth it needs to be realistic, specific and personal**. We give clients an opportunity to write both a personal and a professional vision statement, although many choose to create a single document that covers both. Either way, defining a vision becomes a picture of the possible, a blueprint for action, and a buffer against the inclination to make energy choices reactively rather than reflectively.

明确目标的下一步，是构想如何投入自己的精力。好的构想需要一种谨慎的平衡。一方面，为了激发灵感，它需要有远大的目标，甚至有点超出能力范围；另一方面，为了满足可操作性，它需要脚踏实地，细致规划，因人制宜。我们会要求客户分别写出对个人生活和工作的构想，不过很多人都选择用一篇文章涵盖两个方面。无论哪种方式，构想意味着创造一幅充满可能性的图景，一份行动的蓝图，一种防止做出权宜应急反应的缓冲。

Sara J. is the forty-nine-year-old president of a small consulting company. She began by identifying six core values: integrity, respect for others, excellence, gratitude, self-care and service to others. Next, she got more specific about what these values meant to her in practical, everyday terms. She defined integrity, for example, as “matching my behaviors to my promises, holding myself accountable and making amends as quickly as possible when I fall short.” She embodied gratitude by “taking time out each day to appreciate and acknowledge the blessings and good fortune in my life and focusing on what is best in people and in my everyday experience.” For Sara, living out the value of self-care meant “making my own health and happiness a priority by addressing my important needs and seeking regular renewal in all dimensions of my life.”

49岁的莎拉是一家小型咨询公司的总裁。她首先为自己树立了6种核心价值观——正直、尊重他人、卓越、感恩、关心自己和服务他人。接下来，她在日常的实际行为中细化了这些价值观。例如，她将“正直”定义为“遵守承诺，承担责任，如果没有做到就会立刻弥补”，“感恩”则意味着“承认并感谢上天的恩赐，看到人和事物最光明的一面”。对莎拉来说，“关心自己”就是要“将自身健康和幸福作为首要任务，坚持从各个方面提升自己”。

Over a period of several months and multiple drafts Sara created a vision statement, grounded in her primary values, that was a blend of inspiration and down-to-earth specificity:

通过几个月的不断修改，莎拉最终拿出了一份构想，既基于她的首要价值观，也加入了理想和现实的具体细节：

> Above all else I walk my talk, so that my behaviors reflect my values. I fight passionately for what I believe, but remain open to learning and growing. At work, I am committed to helping people grow, deepen and behave more effectively in the world. I treat all people in my life with respect, kindness and consideration.
>
> “最重要的是言行一致，让行为符合我的价值观。我坚定捍卫自己的信念，对于学习和成长保持开放心态。工作中，我要帮助别人进步，更快更好地融入团体。尊重身边每一个人，和善体贴。
>
> In my personal life, I appreciate, enjoy and give generously to my husband and children, the members of my extended family and my closest friends. I also take care of myself, not just physically but also emotionally, mentally and spiritually.
>
> “在个人生活中，我心怀感激和喜悦，我要无私地对待丈夫、孩子、所有家庭成员和亲近的朋友。我也要照顾好自己，不仅要保持身体健康，情感、思维和意志也要达到平衡状态。
>
> Whatever happens, I am grateful for all that I have been given. Serving others is both a responsibility and a privilege.
>
> 不论发生怎样的事情，我都感恩自己所获得的一切。为他人服务不仅是一项责任，也是一项特权。”

**A vision statement is a declaration of intent about how to invest one’s energy**. **Regularly revisited, it serves as a source of sustaining direction and a fuel for action**. For Vince K., an executive in charge of traders on the New York Stock Exchange, changing his energy management habits both at work and at home proved to be a turning point in his life. “Connecting to my core values was instrumental in refocusing my energies,” he explains. “I was pretty strung out and the whole process of defining my purpose was the catalyst for realizing that I needed to reengage with my family. That was my number one value. It’s easy to give lip service to being a good husband and a good parent. Through the self-evaluation process, I realized the importance of really committing my energy to what I care about on a day-to-day basis. That required giving up drinking, because it was impossible to truly be with my wife and my kids if I drank. It also meant getting back into shape, which was a way to handle the pressures of work better and have more energy when I was at home. Quitting drinking, working out regularly and recommitting to my family changed my whole attitude about life. It made me a better husband, a better father and a better boss.”

构想是精力投入的规划，经常拿出来提醒自己，可以为你指正方向，提供行动所需的精力。文斯是纽约股票交易所的交易主管，改变工作和生活的精力管理习惯是他的重要转折点。“重回核心价值帮我重新分配了精力，”他说。“我曾经整个人都无精打采的。在确立目标的过程中，我意识到需要重新建立与家人的关系，那是我首要的价值观。做一个好丈夫和好父亲说来容易。在自评过程中，我意识到，每天要分配精力给我珍视的人和事意味着我要戒掉饮酒的习惯，因为喝醉时我就不能真心陪伴妻子和孩子。它还意味着我要开始锻炼身体，才能更好地处理工作的压力，在家时才能拿出更多精力。戒酒、按时锻炼、陪伴家人，给我的人生态度带来了重大转折，让我成为了更好的丈夫、更好的父亲和更好的上司。”
