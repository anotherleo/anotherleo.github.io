# Emotional Energy: Transforming Threat into Challenge

Physical energy is the raw fuel for igniting our emotional skills and talents. In order to perform at our best we must access pleasant and positive emotions: enjoyment, challenge, adventure and opportunity. Emotions that arise out of threat or deficit—fear, frustration, anger, sadness—have a decidedly toxic feel to them and are associated with the release of specific stress hormones, most notably cortisol. From our perspective, emotional intelligence is simply the capacity to manage emotions skillfully in the service of high positive energy and full engagement. In practical terms, the key “muscles” or competencies that fuel positive emotion are self-confidence, self-control (self-regulation), social skills (interpersonal effectiveness) and empathy. Smaller, supportive “muscles” include patience, openness, trust and enjoyment.

体能精力是点燃情感技能和才华的燃料。为了发挥出最佳水平，我们必须调动积极愉悦的情感：喜悦，挑战、冒险和机遇。而因威胁或缺乏而滋生的情绪——恐惧、沮丧、愤怒和悲伤——本身对积极情绪有害，与压力荷尔蒙的分泌息息相关，主要是皮质醇。在我们看来，情商的意义在于有技巧地管控情感以保持正面积极的精力，并最终为全情投入服务。在实际应用中，自信、自控、社交技巧及共情能够牵动积极情感的“肌肉”。通俗来说，就是耐心、开放、信任和喜悦。

Access to the emotional muscles that best serve performance depends on creating a balance between exercising them regularly and intermittently seeking recovery. Much the way that we deplete cardiovascular capacity or exhaust a bicep by exposing it to stress, so we run down emotionally if we are constantly spending emotional energy without recovery. When our emotional muscles are weak or insufficient to meet demand—if we have a lack of confidence or too little patience, for example—we must systematically build capacity by devising rituals to push past our current capacity and then recover.

若要调动情感肌肉塑造最佳表现，需要创造定期使用和间歇恢复的平衡。在压力之下，我们往往会失去心脑血管能力或者耗尽二头肌的力量，同样，如果长期消耗情感精力却不容它恢复，情感能力一样会衰弱。当我们的情感肌肉虚弱，不能满足生活要求，比如缺乏自信或缺乏耐心，我们就必须通过一定的模式进行系统训练，使之拥有超出当前承受压力的能力，等待恢复和再生。

Physical and emotional energy capacity are inextricably connected. When demand begins to deplete our physical energy reserves, one of the consequences is that we begin to feel a sense of emergency. We move into the high negative energy quadrant, which alerts us that some need isn’t being met. This was precisely what had happened in Roger B.’s life. Because he paid so little attention to renewing physical energy, the quantity of fuel in his tank had diminished over time. At the same time, he perceived that the pressures and demands in his life were increasing inexorably. Feeling neglected by his boss, worried about his job and disconnected from his family, Roger became increasingly dominated by the experience of anxiety, frustration and defensiveness.

体能和情感精力密不可分。如果压力倍增而体能不足，我们会产生一种紧迫感，进入高-负面的象限，时刻提醒自己有些需求还没有满足。这就是罗杰的现状，他忽视了体能的再生，因此可用燃料随着时间日渐减少，而工作和生活中的压力却在成倍增加。不被老板看重、担心工作、与家庭脱节，罗杰的情感开始被焦虑、沮丧和戒备心理掌控。

From an energy perspective, negative emotions are costly and inefficient. Much like a gas-guzzling car, they draw down our energy stores at a rapid rate. For leaders and managers, negative emotions are doubly insidious, because they are so infectious. If we are prompting fear, anger and defensiveness in others, we progressively undermine their ability to perform effectively. Chronic negative emotions—most especially anger and depression—have also been correlated with a broad range of disorders and diseases ranging from back pain and headaches to heart disease and cancer.

从精力角度来看，负面情感代价昂贵且效率低下。它们会快速耗尽我们的精力储备，好比一辆高油耗的汽车。对于领导者和管理层来说，由于负面情感极易传染，更是具有双倍的危险。如果我们激起了他人的恐惧、愤怒和戒备心，也等同于损害了他们的工作能力。长期的负面情感——主要是愤怒和压抑，还会导致一系列生理紊乱和疾病，小到背痛头痛，大到心脏问题和癌症。

Epidemiologist David Snowdon made precisely this correlation in his study of 678 aging nuns in the School Sisters of Notre Dame Congregation. Snowden set out to study the factors that differentiate nuns who eventually got Alzheimer’s disease from those who did not. All of the nuns he studied had been required to write a personal essay when they came into the order in their early twenties. Upon analysis, Snowden discovered that those nuns whose writing expressed a preponderance of positive emotions (happiness, love, hope, gratitude and contentment) tended to live longer and more productive lives. Nuns with the highest number of positive-emotion sentences had half the risk of death at any age as those with the lowest number of such sentences. This is consistent with the findings from several other studies suggesting that a history of depression—the most insidious of all negative emotions—increases twofold the likelihood of eventually developing Alzheimer’s. These findings deeply influenced Snowdon not just professionally, but also personally. “I now [make] a conscious effort to regain my physiological balance quickly after an upset,” he explains. “I try not to stay stuck in negativity. My goal is to return my body to its normal, healthier state as soon as possible.”

流行病学家大卫·斯诺登在他的研究中详细记录了情绪与疾病的相关性。他以圣母修女学校会众的678名修女为样本，着意于找出患阿兹海默症的修女与未患该病的修女的不同之处。他请每位修女写一篇文章，总结从她们20岁到现在的生活。通过对比，斯诺登发现文章主要内容为正面情感（幸福、爱、希望、感恩和满足等）的修女寿命更长，成就也更多。使用最多正面情感语句的人比使用最少的人在任何年龄段的死亡风险都要低一半。这一结果与其他的研究结论一致——长期抑郁会成倍增加患阿兹海默症的风险。这些结论在学术上和生活上给予斯诺登许多启示。“我现在会有意让自己快速走出苦闷，重塑心理平衡，”他说，“尽量避免自己陷于负面的情绪中。我的目标是让身体尽快恢复正常，更加健康。”

In Roger’s case, he had yet to experience any significant health problems, although he had noticed an increasing pattern of headaches and nagging back pain that distracted and sometimes preoccupied him. As he got into his work with us, Roger started to see other ways in which his negative energy had taken a toll in his life. On days that he felt especially anxious, he noticed that his focus and perseverance failed. When his impatience rose, his interactions with his colleagues became edgier, and he seemed to get less accomplished. Whenever he felt consumed by frustration, a racy sort of exhaustion set in by midday, which left him feeling drained of motivation to work. On those increasingly rare days when he felt relaxed and in control, Roger was able to stay positively engaged no matter how many demands he was facing.

而罗杰还没有体会到严重的健康问题，即使他发觉头痛逐渐频繁，背痛也会分散他的注意力。与我们合作之后，罗杰开始注意到负面精力对生活其他方面的影响。有一天他觉得特别焦虑，既不能保持专注，也没法坚持工作。当他变得急躁时，与同事沟通时也带上棱角，导致他的脾气更差。如果他被挫败感笼罩，刚到中午就感觉精力不足，缺乏工作的动力。

The impact of negative emotions on performance is especially clear in sports. Consider for a moment the contrast between the careers of two tennis greats—John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors. Throughout his career, the volatile McEnroe was easily provoked to anger and frustration by his own mistakes or by line calls that he didn’t like. Connors was similarly volatile early in his career, but as he grew older and more experienced, he began to play with an increasing sense of joy, playfulness, and passion. McEnroe, by contrast, seemed to get very little enjoyment from playing, and his outbursts grew worse as he got older. Connors derived his energy from a sense of opportunity and adventure, while McEnroe’s came more from a defensive posture. He always seemed to be fighting for his life.

负面情感对表现的影响在体育界尤为常见。我们来对比一下网球巨头麦肯罗和康纳斯的事业。在整个职业生涯中，麦肯罗发挥从来都不稳定，不论是自己的失误还是不满判罚，都会让他愤怒而沮丧。康纳斯在早期阶段也同样不稳定，但是随着年龄和阅历的增长，他开始带着愉悦和激情打比赛。而麦肯罗则似乎极少能够享受比赛，年龄大了脾气更坏。康纳斯的精力源于机遇感和冒险，而麦肯罗的精力则来源于防备的姿态。他看上去总是要找人拼命。

On one level, McEnroe’s negativity didn’t appear to affect his performance. Connors may have had more fun, but both players managed to achieve the number one ranking in the world for several years consecutively, and both won numerous Grand Slams. So what then is the evidence that positive emotion is a better fuel for performance? The answer is endurance. On his thirty-ninth birthday, Connors, arguably the less gifted of the two players, reached the semifinals of the U.S. Open. He didn’t retire from the tour until the age of forty. McEnroe retired six years sooner, at the age of thirty-four. At the most basic level, Connors managed his emotional energy far more efficiently than did McEnroe, and was able to play at a high level for far longer. He also got a lot more enjoyment along the way.

从某种层面来看，麦肯罗的负面情感似乎并没有影响他的表现。康纳斯或许享受了更多乐趣，但两位运动员都曾连续几年排名世界第一，并赢得无数大奖赛。那么正面情绪能更好支配表现的证据在哪里？答案是持久性。在他39岁生日时，康纳斯仍打进了美国公开赛的半决赛。虽然很多人说他的天资略逊一筹，但他直到40岁才结束职业生涯。麦肯罗则在34岁时就退役了，比康纳斯早了6年。从根本上讲，康纳斯比麦肯罗更加高效地管理情感精力，因而能够长期保持高水准表现，也更享受比赛的过程。

Today, McEnroe himself recognizes some of the costs of playing matches in the high negative quadrant. Comparing himself to other players who better controlled their emotions, he writes: “My shtick, of course, was getting upset. Did it help me more than hurt me? I don’t think so. Ultimately, my father was right—I probably would have done better if I hadn’t ever gotten into that. But I could never rest on my talent or on anything.” McEnroe’s inability to control his anger, he now believes, was a key factor in what he calls “the worst loss of my life, a devastating defeat”—to Ivan Lendl in the finals of the French Open in 1984, after being up two sets to none. “I wasted too much energy at the French by getting angry,” he explained in his recent autobiography. The experience briefly gave him religion, and he brought this new understanding to his next tournament—Wimbledon. “From the first match at the All England Club,” he says, “I was determined not to do anything that would derail me from avenging Roland Garros (site of the French Open).” Sure enough, McEnroe won Wimbledon, and, not coincidentally, he controlled his temper throughout the tournament.

如今，麦肯罗自己也发现了在高-负面象限比赛的代价。他也将自己与其他情绪掌控更好的选手作了比较：“我的特长，当然就是不高兴。它对我来说是不是利大于弊？我想不是。我的父亲终究是对的——如果我不陷入那样的情绪，表现会更好。但是我却不能信任自己的才能，或者任何事物。”麦肯罗现在认为，对自己的愤怒放任不管，是导致“人生最大损失和最痛苦的失败”的关键因素——1984年法国公开赛的决赛中，麦肯罗对阵伦德尔，开盘连赢两局，却输掉了比赛。“我在法国人身上浪费了太多精力，满腔怒火。”他在最近的自传中写道，并把这次经验带入了下一场比赛——温布尔登公开赛。“从全英俱乐部的首场比赛开始，我决心不让任何事妨碍我向罗兰加洛斯球场（法国公开赛的场地）复仇。”麦克罗理所当然地赢得了温网的比赛，在整个比赛过程中，也成功地控制了他的脾气。

If positive emotion more efficiently fuels individual high performance, it also has a profound organizational impact. After interviewing a large sample of managers and their employees, the Gallup Organization found that no single factor more clearly predicts the productivity of an employee than his relationship with his direct superior. More specifically, Gallup found that the key drivers of productivity for employees include whether they feel cared for by a supervisor or someone at work; whether they have received recognition or praise during the past seven days; and whether someone at work regularly encourages their development. Put another way, the ability to communicate consistently positive energy lies at the heart of effective management.

如果正面情感可以更有效地支配个人表现，它对团体必然也有积极的影响。调取了足够多的经理和员工样本之后，盖洛普公司发现，员工和顶头上司之间的关系比其他因素更能决定员工的效率。盖洛普公司还进一步发现，员工的工作动力包括感受到主管或其他同事的关心、在最近7天内受到认可或表扬、以及工作环境中有人不断鼓励他们进步。换而言之，保持正面沟通是有效管理的核心。

For many years, Roger B. himself was motivated at work in significant part by the feeling that his boss cared for and believed in him. With a supportive wind at his back, he grew more confident of his own value, more positive in his approach to others, and ultimately more successful as a salesman. Success tends to feed on itself, reinforcing the positive emotions that fuel performance in the first place. The reverse is also true. When his boss became less available and less visibly supportive, Roger’s enjoyment and sense of security at work diminished, and so, too, did his confidence, his level of engagement and, ultimately, his performance.

多年来，罗杰在工作中的最大动力就源自老板的关心和信任。有了老板的支持，他对于自我价值越来越有信心，对待他人越来越友好，最终成为了一名成功的销售员。一次成功可以带动多次成功，并再度激发正面情绪。反之亦然。老板越来越忙，对罗杰的支持减少，对工作的享受感和安全感消失了，他的自信和投入也减弱了，最终影响了他的表现。

As his own emotional energy turned more negative, Roger began to have the same demoralizing impact on his direct reports that his boss’s lack of attention had on him. Stop for a moment and think about someone who has been a mentor in your life. Was his or her energy positive or negative? Have you been more motivated and inspired in your life when you were encouraged, supported and challenged or when you were criticized, judged and threatened?

当自己的情感精力在老板的影响下变得负面时，罗杰对下属也施加了同样的影响。请思考你视作人生导师的人。他/她的精力是正面的还是负面的？当你感到充满动力、备受鼓舞，是因为受到了鼓励、支持和挑战，还是责备、批评或威胁？

## ENJOYMENT AND RENEWAL

Simply changing channels is an effective method to refuel emotionally. During the past decade, we have been surprised and dismayed to discover how infrequently most people undertake activities simply because they are enjoyable and emotionally nourishing. One of the most revealing questions that we ask the clients who come through our training is how frequently in their lives they experience a sense of joy or deep satisfaction. The most common answer we get is “rarely.” Think for a moment about your own life. How many hours a week do you devote to activities purely for the pleasure and renewal they provide? What percentage of the time would you describe yourself as feeling deeply relaxed? When was the last time you truly let go and felt fully disconnected?

单纯变换频道就可以有效增加情感精力。过去10年中，让我们既惊讶又失望的是，大部分人做事几乎极少拥有喜悦的情绪，也无法从中获得情感的滋润。我们常常问客户，他们在生活中是否经常体验到愉悦或深刻满足的感觉？最常见的答案是“极少”。请思考一下你的生活。每周你会拿出几个小时仅仅做一些有趣放松的事情吗？有多少时间你感到自己彻底的放松？你上一次摒弃杂念、完全投入某件事情是什么时候？

Any activity that is enjoyable, fulfilling and affirming tends to prompt positive emotions. Depending on your interests, that may mean singing, gardening, dancing, making love, doing yoga, reading an absorbing book, playing a sport, visiting a museum, attending a concert, or simply spending quiet, reflective time alone after an intense day of engaging with other people. The key, we have found, is making such activities priorities, and treating the time that you invest in them as sacrosanct. The point is not just that pleasure is its own reward, but more practically, that it is a critical ingredient in sustained performance.

所有能带来享受、满足和安全感的活动都能够激发正面情感。由于人们兴趣各异，这些活动可能是唱歌，园艺，跳舞，亲热，练瑜伽，读书，体育运动，参观博物馆，听音乐会，或者仅仅是在忙碌地社交之后静坐自省。我们发现，关键是要表达出你对这些活动的重视，并将投入在它们上面的时间视为神圣而不可侵犯。不仅快乐本身便是奖赏，从更实际的角度看，快乐也是维持最佳表现的重要因素。

The depth or quality of emotional renewal is something else again. That depends on how absorbing, enriching and enlivening the activity turns out to be. Television, for example, is one of the primary means by which most people relax and recover. For the most part, however, watching television is the mental and emotional equivalent of eating junk food. It may provide a temporary form of recovery, but it is rarely nutritious and it is easy to consume too much. Researchers such as Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi have found that prolonged television watching is actually correlated with increased anxiety and low-level depression. Conversely, the richer and deeper the source of emotional recovery, the more we refill our reserves and the more resilient we become. Effective emotional renewal puts us in a position to perform more effectively, especially under pressure.

情感再生的深度或质量则是另一码事，它们取决于活动本身的吸引力、丰富程度和生动性。例如，看电视是很多人寻求放松的首选。然而从科学角度看，看电视对思维和情感的影响等同于垃圾食品对身体的影响。看电视或许可以带来暂时的恢复，却缺乏营养，容易使人消耗过度。心理学家契克森米哈里等发现，长时间观看电视会导致焦虑增长和轻度抑郁。相比之下，情绪恢复的来源越丰富、越有内涵，我们越能补充自己的精力储备，恢复力越好。有效的情绪再生使我们的表现更高效，在压力之下尤为明显。

## ERICA R.: ANXIETY, RIGIDITY

Erica R. was a highly successful lawyer at a large corporate firm. Her complaint was that she felt relentlessly pressured by the demands of her job, forever worried about the quality of her work and guilty about giving too little time to her two sons, ages eleven and thirteen. Life struck her as an unending series of obligations, and she took every one of them seriously. To control her anxiety, Erica planned her time meticulously and held herself to exacting standards. She had a reputation for being very good at what she did but also for being rigid and brusque with people. Her relationship with her partners was respectful but distant, and many of the firm’s associates tried to avoid being assigned to cases with her.

艾丽卡是一名成功的律师，就职于一家大型企业。她抱怨说工作总是无穷无尽。她担忧自己的工作质量，并为挤不出时间陪伴11岁和13岁的儿子而自责。生活之于她是一系列永无止境的义务，她试图认真对待每一件。为了控制焦虑，艾丽卡细心地规划时间，对自己要求严苛。她的工作非常专业，人际交往却表现得生硬而唐突。她跟搭档互相敬重却关系疏远，甚至有许多同事在努力避免与她分配到同一个项目组。

The issue for Erica was less about increasing capacity than it was about relaxing and letting go. Like many of our clients—especially women—she took almost no time for herself. When we asked her to recall a time of great joy in her life, she thought first about the birth of her two children. The only other memories that came immediately to mind were the night of her high school prom and the day of her marriage. Not one of these events had occurred less than a decade ago. Just thinking about taking time for pleasure and relaxation, Erica sheepishly acknowledged, made her feel uncomfortable. Even on vacations with her family, she played the role of chief tour guide, determined to see as many sights as possible and unable to contemplate lying on a beach and simply relaxing.

艾丽卡的问题并不是工作能力不足，而是精力再生不够。就像许多职业女性一样，她从来没有时间留给自己。我们请她回想自己巨大喜悦的经历，她首先想到的是两个孩子的诞生，然后就是高中的毕业舞会和结婚当日。这些事情没有一件是在最近十年里发生的。艾丽卡不好意思地承认，仅仅是娱乐和休息的念头就足以让她感到不舒服。即使在全家一起外出度假，她也总是充当导游的角色，一心游览更多的景点，而不是满足于躺在沙滩上放松一下。

We suggested to Erica that she could be more effective at work, personally and interpersonally, if she created more space between obligations and took specific time out to simply enjoy herself and to refuel emotionally. She already had in place a very regular early-morning exercise regimen, but it was scarcely a source of pleasure. She went to the gym four days a week before work, and pushed herself relentlessly for thirty to forty minutes on the step machine or the treadmill. She found exercise monotonous, and she hated having to wake up so early in order to get back home before her children awoke. It was just one more obligation to get through.

我们建议，艾丽卡其实可以在工作、生活和人际交往中变得更有效率，如果她能够在每项职责间留出空间享受一下生活，就可以补充情感精力。她已经养成了清晨锻炼的习惯，但是算不上休闲娱乐。每周有四天，她会在上班之前去健身房，强迫自己在台阶机或跑步机上待满30或40分钟。她觉得这样锻炼很单调，而且不愿意早起就去健身房，还要赶在孩子起床之前回来。锻炼变成了另一项义务。

We asked Erica if there was any form of physical activity that she genuinely enjoyed. As a child, she told us, she had been a dancer, and while she had finally burned out on the rigorous demands of ballet, she had always loved other forms of dance such as modern, jazz and African. We suggested that she substitute dance classes for her workouts at least a couple of days a week, and consider taking them at the end of the day before returning home as a way to make the transition. Erica agreed to give it a shot. In a short time, dance classes became simultaneously a source of pleasure, a means to fully disconnect from work, and something to which she found herself eagerly looking forward.

我们问艾丽卡有没有真心喜欢的体育活动，她说小时候学过舞蹈，虽然因为芭蕾的严格训练而中止，她依旧热爱其他类型的舞蹈，比如现代舞、爵士舞和非洲舞。我们建议她每周用舞蹈课代替一些常规锻炼，最好安排在下班之后，为工作到家庭的转变做好准备。艾丽卡同意放手一试。很快，舞蹈课变成了她每周最期盼的事情，是她脱离工作的有效方式。

As we explored further, Erica told us that a second great love in her youth had been reading fiction. As an adult, however, she rarely read for pleasure at all. Spending time in nature was the other activity that she had experienced as deeply renewing but rarely found time to do. Erica decided to devise a ritual that combined both sources of enjoyment. Even though she lived in a warm climate, she had for years eaten lunch at her desk in order to save time. She decided to create a forty-five minute routine around taking a bag lunch to an arboretum five minutes from her office and eating on a bench while reading a novel. In addition, on Saturday mornings she set aside two hours for gardening.

随着进一步了解，我们得知艾丽卡年轻时的第二爱好是小说。然而成年之后，她却很少有机会深入阅读。走进自然也会让她感到深深的放松，但是苦于找不到时间去做。艾丽卡决定设计一种方案把两个爱好包含起来。即便身处气候温暖的地区，她也已经连续多年为了节省时间在办公桌前吃午饭了。她打算午间抽出45分钟，前往离公司5分钟路程的一家植物园，坐在里面的长椅上吃午餐、读小说。除此之外，周六早上还要给自己安排2个小时做园艺。

At first, Erica told us, these new routines seemed almost intolerably indulgent—akin to cutting a class in school. But the blend of dance classes, gardening and her time in the park made her feel so much better in such a short time that all three activities began to exert a strong pull on her. The impact cascaded into her professional life. Rather than feeling resentful about her workload, as she had for several years, she found that she was able to rediscover a good deal of satisfaction in the intellectual challenge it provided. She remained a demanding taskmasker, but she began to see that she could also serve as a mentor to associates. She also saw that when she was more encouraging, she was often more effective. In the evenings—most especially after dance class—she began to be able to relax more with her husband and children. On the days that Erica didn’t dance or take her lunch in the park, she could feel a palpable difference both in her anxiety level and in her ability to focus in the afternoons.

艾丽卡告诉我们，起初这些新常规让她难以接受，有种上学时翘课的感觉。但是舞蹈课、园艺和公园午餐带给她的感觉如此美妙，对她产生了莫大的吸引力。这种积极影响自然带进了她的工作中。她不再对庞大的工作量心生怨恨，开始从工作带来的思维挑战中感到另一种满足。她依旧是一名严格的监工，但她发觉，自己也可以为同事提出建议和指导。她越能鼓舞他人，自己工作起来越是高效。晚上回到家——尤其是在上完舞蹈课以后，面对丈夫和孩子她感觉更加放松了。在不上舞蹈课或不去公园午餐的时候，她能够明显感觉出在焦虑程度和下午的精力质量上的差别。

## HEALING IN THE BROKEN PLACES

In some instances, we face involuntary emotional storms—challenges that come to us unbidden. Depending on how we manage them, they can either overwhelm us or serve as an opportunity for growth. It is hard to imagine a more severe test of emotional capacity than to have been working at the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11, 2001. Jeffrey S. is a longtime client of ours and a managing director at a financial services firm headquartered directly across the street from the Twin Towers. When the first plane hit, Jeffrey watched in horror from his forty-sixth-floor window. Two of his largest accounts were companies headquartered in the two buildings. As Jeffrey helped to supervise the evacuation of his own firm’s employees, he realized in horror that dozens of friends and colleagues were likely trapped in the two burning buildings next door. He was two blocks away when the first tower collapsed, and he ended up walking seven miles uptown to get home. When he finally reunited with his wife and his ten-month-old daughter, he collapsed in tears. “I just completely lost it,” he told us.

有时我们会不由自主地经历情感风暴，接受人生汹涌而来的挑战。让自己被风暴淹没还是在风暴中成长，取决于我们的情感管理方式。大概没有任何情感试炼比2001年9月11日早晨的那一场更为严峻了。杰弗里是我们的长期客户，他是一名金融服务公司的总经理，公司总部设在双子塔对面的办公楼里。当第一架飞机撞击大楼时，杰弗里满心恐惧地从46层办公室的玻璃窗向外张望。他们最大的两家客户的公司总部就在那两栋建筑里。当杰弗里帮忙疏散公司员工时，他惊恐地意识到许多朋友和同事很可能就困在那两栋燃烧的建筑里。当第一座塔倒塌时，他已经走到两个街区以外。最终他步行7英里回家，与妻子和10月大的女儿抱在一起，泪水止不住地流下。“当时真是完全控制不住了。”他告诉我们。

In the weeks ahead, Jeffrey struggled to regain his footing. Accustomed to working out every day, he found it hard at first to summon any motivation to continue. In a short time, however, he realized that keeping this physical routine helped anchor him to a sense of normalcy and provided a source of emotional recovery each day. Given the pressures he was under, it dawned on Jeffrey that he actually needed more energy capacity than usual. Difficult as it was, he decided to increase the intensity of his workouts. He also committed himself to playing with his young daughter every night, even when he was feeling exhausted and depressed. On one level, that meant putting aside his own seemingly urgent needs. On another, he derived a powerful source of renewal from his time with his child. Perhaps the most extraordinary and unexpected dimension of Jeffrey’s experience grew out of dealing with the deaths of so many friends and colleagues. For three months after September 11, he attended at least one and sometimes as many as two or three funerals and memorial services a week—several dozen in all, nearly all for people in their twenties and thirties. It was painful, fiercely sad, and exhausting, but at a certain point it dawned on Jeffrey that it was also enormously healing and deepening.

接下来的几周时间，杰弗里试图让自己重新振作起来。虽然他已经习惯了每天健身，但起初还是很难坚持下去。但他很快意识到，锻炼能够让他感到生活如常，并且提供情感安抚。考虑到身上的压力，杰弗里意识到他还需要更多的精力。他决定增加锻炼强度。他还保证每晚陪女儿玩耍，即使工作结束后他疲倦又抑郁。这一方面意味着他要放下其他看似紧急的需求，另一方面也让他从女儿身上得到情感的抚慰。或许最特别、最让他铭记于心的经历，是众多朋友和同事的离世。在“9·11事件”之后的三个月里，他每周至少出席一次葬礼或者纪念活动，纪念对象都是20多岁、 30多岁的年轻人。这个过程很痛苦，让人极度悲伤、心生疲惫，但杰弗里渐渐懂得，这也是疗伤和成长的过程。

“In a way these funerals made it more difficult to get back to a normal life,” Jeffrey told us. “But what happened is that I found myself converting them into an opportunity to honor and pay tribute to all of these people who had been so important to me. It was also a chance to be with other people who were going through the same things I was. These services gave me a chance to express my deep feelings to the families of the people I had known. Many of the funerals became a celebration of life. It was more than a humbling experience, it was leveling, but I think I got stronger for it, in part because I took more time for recovery.

“在某种程度上，人们很难在经历葬礼后感觉一切如常。”杰弗里告诉我们。“但是我发现自己开始珍惜和尊重对我来说非常重要的人们。它让我有机会接触与我有相似经历的人们，有机会向朋友的家人表达我深切的哀悼。许多葬礼到最后变成了对生命的庆祝，这不仅震撼人心，也是一种平衡。我感觉自己也变得坚强起来，或许是因为我也花了许多时间平复情绪。”

“The grief still comes in waves, but I feel clearer than ever about my priorities. Some people in our office were so traumatized that they never came back to work after September 11. I had been training at LGE for years, learning how to balance stress and recovery, but really it was just to be better, to exceed myself. Now I realize that there are a couple of times in your life that really matter, pivotal moments when what you’ve got to draw on makes all the difference in how you emerge from the darkness. This was one of them.”

“悲伤还会时常来袭，但我从未如此清醒地看待人生。有一些同事深受打击，‘9·11’之后再也没有来公司上班。几年来我一直参加培训，看似是学习如何平衡压力，实际上它帮助我超越自己，成为更好的人。我现在明白了，人生会有几次特别重大的时刻，你所依赖的事物决定了你如何从废墟中站起。 9月11日就是其中之一。”

## RELATIONSHIPS AS STRESS RENEWAL

Creating a rhythmic balance between energy expenditure and energy recovery is more complex emotionally than it is physically, but no less critical to optimal performance and full engagement. The delicate dance of a healthy friendship, for example, can be a powerful source both of positive energy and of renewal. Gallup found that one of the key factors in sustained performance is having at least one good friend at work. The pulse of a strong relationship involves a rhythmic movement between giving and taking, talking and listening, valuing the other person and feeling commensurately valued in return. A relationship in which you do most of the giving and receive very little in return ultimately prompts a sense of deficit and emptiness. A self-absorbed relationship isn’t really much of a relationship at all.

达到情感精力消耗和恢复的动态平衡比起体力层面困难许多，但对于优化表现和全情投入却同样重要。比如维持一段健康的友谊可以带来积极的情感精力及其更新。盖洛普公司发现，保持优秀表现的诀窍之一是在工作环境中至少交一位好朋友。一段稳固的关系包括付出与回报、倾诉与倾听、珍视他人和被人同等珍视。如果一段关系中总是付出而得不到相应的回馈，不免会感到空虚和失落。以自我为中心的关系，也称不上真正的情感关系。

When Barbara P. came to see us, she was a single, thirty-seven-year-old marketing executive who worked exceptionally long hours at her job, in part because she had few friends or outside interests. She ended most days feeling exhausted, resentful and even despairing. After going through our program, and confronting her performance barriers, Barbara recognized that one key to feeling better was to systematically build more recovery into her life. She began by taking an aerobics class at a nearby health club after work each day. As we have noted, a challenging physical workout often serves as a source of positive emotional renewal. Sure enough, Barbara invariably finished her workouts feeling more positive. As she became more physically fit, she felt better about herself and better equipped to handle demands and deal with setbacks at work.

37岁的芭芭拉走进了我们的办公室。她是一位营销主管，工作时间很长，一部分是因为她没多少朋友，也没什么业余爱好。工作结束后，她总是感到筋疲力尽，甚至悲哀绝望。通过我们的引导，芭芭拉看到了自己的表现障碍，意识到在日常生活中加入精力更新过程可以改善心态。于是她报名参加了健身房的有氧运动课程。每天下班之后她都要锻炼。充满挑战性的身体锻炼总能带动积极的情感再生。随着芭芭拉的身体越来越健康，情绪越来越高涨，她更加自信能更好地处理工作压力，面对挫折。

To her surprise, the most powerful source of positive renewal for Barbara came from the relationships that she made along the way. The aerobics class provided a way to connect with others, and she began to go out regularly for dinner with several of her classmates. Where she had long felt isolated and unappreciated at work, Barbara found that she was able to relax, laugh and talk freely with her new friends. She became as invested in their lives as they did in hers. Nourished and renewed by the time with these new friends, she built a reservoir of positive emotional energy that she could draw from at her job. Because she was in a more upbeat mood when she arrived at work in the mornings, she found that she was often able to concentrate better. She also became less reactive and more relaxed in her dealings with colleagues and her boss, and her professional relationships improved. When she worked too long without breaks, she could still lose her temper or turn negative, which set her back. But on balance her more positive feelings fed on one another. Barbara found herself spending so much less energy on anger, resentment and frustration that she was more able to engage positively at work.

让她感到惊喜的是，最强大的情感精力来源于她在健身过程中建立的新友谊。有氧课程提供了人际交往的平台，她开始跟其他同好频繁聚餐。在工作中感到孤立无援、不被肯定时，与新朋友交流会带给她欢笑和轻松感。她也开始努力回馈朋友们。在友谊的滋润下，她获取了丰富的情感精力，并且成功转化为工作的动力。早晨上班时她的情绪更加昂扬，工作时注意力也更容易集中了。与同事和老板相处时，她也变得更加温和、放松，人际关系有了很大改善。若是连续工作很久，芭芭拉还是会控制不住情绪，但总体来讲，积极情绪会自己保持。芭芭拉也发现生气、怨念和沮丧的情绪越来越少，在工作上也更能够积极投入。

## JED R.: LACK OF DEPTH IN RELATIONSHIPS

Jed R.’s issue wasn’t so much the absence of other relationships in his life, but the fact that he gave them so little time and energy. At the age of forty-eight, he was the head of creative services for a midsize advertising agency. Charming and quick-witted, he was well-liked and highly successful, but he also felt increasingly detached and restless at work, as if he were just going through the motions. The biggest void in his life, he told us, was the quality of his relationships. Whether it was with colleagues and direct reports at the office or with his wife and child at home, he felt that his connections were disturbingly thin and superficial. Jed feared that his wife’s complaints about his unavailability were beginning to threaten their marriage. They had one child, an eleven-year-old girl, and he worried that he was distant from her, too. At work, he had perfectly pleasant relationships with his colleagues and direct reports, but he felt very little depth of connection with any of them.

杰德的问题并非是生活中缺乏情感关系，而是对情感关系投入太少。48岁的他是一家中型广告公司的创意部主管，魅力十足，思维灵活，是一位十分受欢迎的成功人士。但是他感觉自己工作时越来越不在状态，就像在神游。他告诉我们，自己生活最大的缺口就是情感关系。不管是同办公室的同事和下属，还是与家里的妻子和孩子之间，他感觉自己跟外界的联系变得淡薄，流于表面。妻子总是抱怨他不顾家，这种不满已经开始影响他们的婚姻关系。他们婚后育有一女，女儿已经11岁了，杰德担心自己是不是也疏远了孩子。在工作中，他和同事、下属的关系都很愉快，但是从未和他们深入交流过。

Jed decided to build a series of rituals around investing more time and energy in the key people in his life. He began with his wife, suggesting that they set aside ninety minutes on Saturday mornings just to talk and catch up on the week. He also suggested that they build in a date night every other week on Wednesday evenings, and that on those weeks when either of them had to travel, they try to reschedule the date for the following week.

杰德决定督促自己对身边重要的人投入更多时间和精力。改变首先从他与妻子的关系开始，他建议夫妻俩在周六上午抽出1个半小时，聊聊一周里发生的事情。他还建议将每隔一周的周三定为“约会之夜”，如果其中一方周三要出差，就在下周重新选个日子。

Jed also established a weekly Monday night dinner out with his daughter. Doing so gave his wife an opportunity to take a web-design class at a local community college. Jed quickly discovered that he derived great pleasure from the time alone with his daughter, and she clearly valued and looked forward to their time together as well. Much like Rachel P., Jed found that the positive energy he derived from the time with his wife and with his child gave him an increased sense of buoyancy and energy on the job.

杰德也打算每周一带女儿外出晚餐，让妻子有时间参加社区大学的网页设计课程。杰德很快发现，与女儿独处时也乐趣无穷，显然她也很珍惜同父亲交流的机会。杰德从妻子和女儿那里获得的情感精力给工作带来更多轻松感。

At work, Jed decided to institute a lunch each Friday with one of his direct reports. He sensed their apprehension at first, since they were unused to so much attention, but word soon got around that he had no particular agenda. Jed grew more connected with his direct reports, and several of them went out of their way to tell him how much they appreciated his willingness to take time for them. Several months later, Jed decided to build a second ritual at work. Once every other month, at the end of the workday, he invited his staff to join together for an activity—bowling, or dinner, or ice-skating. It was a chance to spend time together in an informal setting. Consciously and systematically devoting more time and energy to his family and to his colleagues left Jed feeling more connected at home and more invested in his work.

至于办公室的情况，杰德决定每周五与一位下属共进午餐。下属们起初非常不安，因为上司从未给予他们如此的关注。但他们慢慢发现，上司好像也没有其他意图。杰德与下属的关系越来越紧密，还有人直接当面感谢他花时间与他们相处。几个月后，杰德又发起一项新计划。每月一次，他会邀请同事下班后参加集体活动——打保龄球、聚餐或者滑冰，让大家在私人时间里聚会。通过主动而系统地投入时间和精力，杰德与家人越来越亲密，工作也越来越投入。

## EXPANDING EMOTIONAL CAPACITY

There are times when demand overwhelms our emotional capacity, even if we are regularly seeking renewal. Just as there is only so much weight you can lift without running up against your limits, so there is only so much emotional demand you can tolerate without turning negative. The best way to build an emotional muscle, much like a physical muscle, is to push past your current comfort zone and then recover.

即便我们定期更新情感精力，也不得不应对超出情绪范围的突发事件。如果不超越极限，身体的负重能力只会停留在有限的范围。同体力一样，情感容量也有限度，只能够帮助人们容忍某些事情而不变得消极负面。锻炼情感肌肉等同于锻炼身体肌肉，也需要迈出当前的舒适区，并随后进行休整，恢复精力。

Perhaps no obstacle to full engagement and high performance is so pervasive and so vexing as insecurity and low self-esteem. Complex and subtle factors account for such feelings, but positive energy rituals can nonetheless be effective in building greater self-confidence. 

论及全情投入和最佳表现的障碍，没有什么比不安全感和自卑心理更防不胜防、令人烦恼了。这些情绪产生的原因固然复杂又微妙，但积极的精力仪式习惯依然可以帮助人们树立自信。

Judith F. had a reasonably successful design business, but lived in constant fear that she would one day be revealed as the imposter she felt herself to be. Anyone who really knew her couldn’t possibly like her, she believed. As a result, she was reluctant to actively reach out for new clients and instead relied exclusively on word-of-mouth referrals. She was also reluctant to say what she really felt with clients who had strong opinions of their own for fear of antagonizing them. The cost was that she often felt inauthentic and she sometimes failed to give clients the benefit of her very well developed and sophisticated design sense.

朱迪思经营着一家非常成功的设计公司，但她却成天担心被人揭发，称作骗子。她觉得自己就是骗子，认为任何了解她的人都不可能喜欢她。因此她十分抗拒接洽新的客户，只靠口碑相传做生意。她也不愿对固执的客户说出自己的想法，害怕出现对抗的场景。长此以往，她越来越感觉自己不可靠，有时也无法在作品中为客户呈现出自己敏锐和复杂的设计思路。

> 向所有客户反馈真正的设计方案

We began by helping Judith to shift her equation from worrying about how others viewed her to focusing on living each day guided by her own deepest values. The two values that she identified as most fundamental were genuineness and courage, neither of which she felt she exemplified in her everyday life. For years, she would meet people in her community or through her work and see an opportunity to pursue them as potential clients. Fearful of rejection, she wouldn’t follow up. One of the first rituals Judith created was to set a quota of calls that she would make to reach out to people—designating Monday and Wednesday mornings at 9:00 A.M. to pursue new professional leads.

我们开始帮助朱迪思转变心态，不再担忧他人的看法，每天依照自己的原则生活。她认为自己最看重的两种品质是真诚和勇气，但是她并未身体力行地实践每一项。一直以来她都能够通过圈子或者工作认识很多人，也能发现潜在的客户。但只是因为害怕被拒绝，她从来不敢跟进客户。因此，她为自己制定的第一个新仪式习惯就是在周一、周三上午9点打跟进电话，发掘潜在的商业机会。

In a paradigm shift, Judith increasingly began to measure herself by the courage she demonstrated in making these weekly calls and not by the particular response she received. She also committed to telling every client who hired her what she really thought about any significant design issue that came up, even if it meant disagreeing with them.

改变实施后，朱迪思学会了用拨出电话的举动衡量自己的勇气，而不是用某个回绝电话来评判自己的成就。她也决心在设计方面与客户发生分歧时说出自己的真实想法。

Simultaneously, Judith made a decision to be more genuine with people in her personal life rather than trying to figure out how to please them, as she had done in the past. To her surprise and relief, the responses she got, both personally and professionally, were far more positive than she anticipated. Most of her clients especially appreciated her clarity and definitiveness. Her old insecurities didn’t simply disappear. When she encountered an especially difficult client, she found herself reverting to her old inclination to defer and simply go along in order not to rock the boat. Over time, however, Judith found that she became less concerned with how people viewed her, and began deriving a sense of accomplishment and strength instead from having acted consistently with the values she held most dear. She discovered that it was possible to be tactful without being inauthentic.

同时，朱迪思也决心更加真诚地面对周围的人，而不是像过去那样一味取悦他们。让她大吃一惊的是，这些工作和生活的转变收获了许多良好的反馈，大大超出了她的预期，让她松了口气。绝大多数客户都很欣赏她清晰的思维和明确的思路，不过，当面对刁钻的客户时，朱迪斯还会不自觉地退回原来的习惯，附和客户，避免冲突。然而，朱迪思渐渐发现，因为她已经不再那么看重别人对她的看法，她从自己的原则里获得了勇气和精神支柱。

The second ritual Judith instituted was to devote some of her time to a cause that she cared about. Giving to others, she decided, was an investment of her time and energy that she very much wanted to make. The activity she chose gave her the opportunity to draw on a strength she had not tapped for many years. Judith had a gift for languages, and she spoke French and Spanish fluently. It turned out that a public high school in the town adjacent to hers had a large population of Spanish-speaking students with a great need for remedial help in learning English. Judith volunteered her time one afternoon a week and got some very precious benefits in return: the opportunity to feel both competent and useful, and a sense of genuine appreciation from the school administrators and from many of the kids as well. While her purpose in volunteering was not to improve her performance at work, the positive ways that it made her feel about herself spilled over into the rest of her life. This was true not just when it came to seeking new clients, but also in the confidence she brought to her design work itself.

朱迪斯建立的第二个仪式习惯是为自己一直关心的某项事业付出时间。她认为，为他人付出是她非常愿意投入时间和精力的事。她最后选择的活动给了她一个机会，发挥一项多年未用的专长。朱迪思本人语言天赋极高，可以流畅地讲法语和西班牙语。她家附近的镇上公立高中有一大批讲西班牙语的学生需要英语辅导，朱迪思自愿每周抽出一个下午去授课，并获得了珍贵的回报——施展才华的机会，学校管理层的感谢，以及众多学生的爱戴。虽然这项义务工作与她的工作内容并无关联，但它带来的自我肯定毫无疑问会影响她的一生。不仅表现在主动发掘新客户的行动上，也流露在向客户交付的设计作品中展现的浓浓的自信里。

## ALAN D.: POOR LISTENING SKILLS, LOW EMPATHY

One of the primary barriers our clients face in the workplace is difficulty getting along with bosses and colleagues. Likewise, one of the key challenges for leaders and managers is creating positive relationships with their direct reports.

我们的客户在工作方面的首要障碍之一就是与老板和同事相处。同理，领导者和管理层面对的主要挑战之一也在于同下属的关系。

Alan D. was the head of the marketing division of a large consumer-products company. Valued for his quick, penetrating mind and his immense creativity, he tended to dominate any project in which he got involved. In Alan’s mind, he was simply trying to get the best result. The problem was that he frequently left his colleagues and direct reports feeling unvalued, unheard and even demeaned. Alan was dismayed to discover, through his Full Engagement Inventory data, that while he was appreciated for his brilliance and creativity, he was also viewed as distant, uncommunicative and critical. His immediate instinct was to attribute this feedback to the high standard that he set. He had the same explanation for the high turnover in his department. He also told us that he didn’t consider it an efficient use of his time to “hang out” with employees. As we probed a little deeper, Alan acknowledged that he was uncomfortable with intimacy and awkward at small talk. It also dawned on him, for the first time, that he almost never focused on how others might be feeling as he entered a collaborative venture.

阿伦是一家大型消费品公司的市场部总监，凭借敏锐的思维和超强的创意为人称道。他喜欢主导自己参与的每个项目，在他看来，这仅仅是为了取得最好的成效而已。但是他的同事和下属却认为自己不受重视，甚至觉得受到了侮辱。阿伦始终没有发现别人对他的不满。纵观他的全情投入问卷数据，他的聪明与创意的确得到了大家的认可，但大家同时也评价他疏远、不爱交流、行事挑剔。他本能地将这些反馈归咎为自己高标准严要求的风格，并对自己部门高居不下的人事变动率也给出相同的解释。他先是告诉我们，跟下属“一起玩”没有意义。随着我们进一步追问，他承认自己不习惯亲密的关系，并且觉得闲聊会尴尬。他也头一次意识到，当他以强硬姿态加入某个合作项目时，从来都没想过别人的感受。

While some people are simply more hard-wired than others for specific emotional competencies, that doesn’t preclude developing a given emotional muscle to the limits of its potential. Empathy simply - wasn’t in Alan’s emotional vocabulary. To build this muscle—to learn to experience the world from a wholly different perspective than his own—required practice and repetition. We appealed first to Alan’s sense of logic. Until he really learned how to listen to others without interruption and instant judgment, we suggested, how could he fairly judge their competence? If his behavior made people feel that he wasn’t truly listening to them, we said, then how likely were they to feel motivated by him or to produce their best and most creative work?

有些人在某些情感方面的确比他人更为生硬，但这并不妨碍他们锻炼这块情感肌肉，提高它的灵活性。“共情”一词根本就不在阿伦的情感词典里 。如果要他抛开自己看待世界的角度，势必需要大量的反复练习。我们首先求助于阿伦的逻辑思维，给他的建议是，只有真正学会倾听他人，不插嘴，也不作武断的判定，他才能公平地评判他们的能力。如果他的行为让人们认为他并没有真心倾听，人们怎么会接受他的鼓励，创造出最好、最有创意的作品呢？

True empathy requires letting go of our own agendas, at least temporarily.

若要做到真正的共情，我们需要放下自己的既定安排，至少是暂时放下。

Alan decided to build a ritual focused on listening more attentively and trying to put himself in the shoes of the person with whom he was talking. Rather than rushing in with his own point of view, he committed to beginning meetings by listening to others in a structured way—intermittently reflecting back in his own words what he had just heard without critiquing it. Alan found it revelatory to discover that he - didn’t necessarily have to agree with what another person was saying in order to respectfully acknowledge a different point of view. He did this by using phrases such as “I can see why that makes sense” and “I understand how what I said might make you feel that.” When it came time to express his own opinion, he chose phrasings such as “Let me suggest another way of looking at this,” or “I wonder if there is a possibility of taking another approach.” He also tried to lower his voice when he spoke. His goal was to stay attentive to how what he said was likely to affect the energy of others in the room.

阿伦决定建立新仪式习惯，更加专注地倾听他人，设身处地理解谈话对象。他改变了会议方式，从积极倾听别人的意见开始，而不是急于提出自己的观点。他会不时用自己的语言总结别人的讲话内容，而不是加以批判。阿伦觉得很受启发，他发现并不需要赞同他人才能尊重异见。他用“我明白这为什么说得通了”和“我理解为什么我的话会让你这样想”等表达方式来显示尊重。当需要发表自己的看法时，他会选择“我建议换一种方式看待这个问题”或者“我在想还有没有其他方法”的表达方式提出建议，并且试图降低音调。他希望看到自己言语风格的改变会给办公室内的人带来怎样的影响。

These sorts of fundamental changes in personal style are very difficult to make, and Alan struggled with them during the weeks after he first built his ritual. Our experience—and considerable research—suggests that setbacks are an intrinsic part of any significant change process. The motivation to make a change, and even the specific plan for doing so, may often just be the first step. The researcher James Prochaska has found, for example, that people launching a major change in their lives often fail several times before succeeding in a sustaining way.

对个人风格做出巨大改变非常困难，阿伦在习惯建立初期的几周里特别吃力。依照我们的经验，还有多项研究的结论显示，挫折是任何重大变化中无法避免的一部分。做出改变的决心仅仅是变革的第一步。研究员詹姆斯·普罗查斯卡发现，人们做出重大生活改变时，通常需要失败多次才能获得持续的成功。

Because Alan’s ritual felt awkward to him at first, he used it very selectively. By the end of a month, however, he noticed that when he was more affirmative—nodding his head when he listened, paraphrasing what he had heard—it had a palpably positive impact on others. Often he could see their body language change. They sat up straighter, leaned forward in their chairs, became more alive and animated. Alan was also fascinated to discover that the nature of his interchanges with people changed. The more that he was able to listen attentively, the freer people became about offering their own ideas and the more he began to see that his own point of view wasn’t always necessarily complete—or even accurate.

由于阿伦最初应用这些仪式习惯时感到无比尴尬，他决定有选择地使用。一个月后，他发现自己习惯了在倾听过程中不时点头，总结别人的讲话，这对他人产生了积极的影响。他能注意到人们身体语言的变化——坐得更直，身体前倾，表现得更加积极和活跃。与人交流发生本质变化让阿伦非常高兴。他越是专注倾听，人们越会自由表达想法。他也开始意识到，自己的想法并非总是全面准确的。

Alan also decided to institute a routine of getting up from his desk in the afternoons in order to visit the offices of one of his direct reports. At first, it felt awkward and he limited himself to very small time increments—three or four minutes, which seemed tolerable. He also talked strictly about business issues. Even at that, however, Alan could sense that the colleagues he stopped in to see were very happy to have his undivided attention. Their appreciation made him feel more relaxed, and over the next several months he extended his visits to ten or fifteen minutes. For Alan himself, these sessions became a source of recovery—a means of switching channels after intense periods of work at his desk. He also noticed that several of his top executives began showing up at his office door more frequently to discuss issues, rather than emailing him, as they had always done previously.

阿伦还决定每天下午走进办公区，与一位下属随意聊天。起初他感觉很别扭，于是尽量将聊天时间控制在3～4分钟，话题也都是关于工作。即便如此，阿伦还是发现聊天的下属很高兴自己得到了上司的关注。他们的认可让阿伦放松下来，停留的时间延长至10～15分钟。对于阿伦来说，这样的对话也变成了一种放松方式，让他走出繁重的工作，变换思路。他注意到，一些高级管理人员也更频繁地来到办公室讨论工作，而不是像之前一样发邮件汇报。

While Alan had spent years in a collaborative business, he found that systematically building the capacity to listen attentively and to connect more personally with colleagues opened him for the first time to the depth, richness and excitement of other points of view. He recognized that he still had a good distance to travel, but he felt that he had already become a significantly more effective and inspiring leader.

在公司工作多年，阿伦发现系统地建立用心倾听的能力，并与同事进行更为密切的交谈，让他头一次兴奋地发现了别人意见的深度和丰富性。他意识到还有很长的路要走，但是他觉得自己已经成为了一位更有效，更能激励人的领导。

## PAUL M.: IMPATIENT, OVERLY CRITICAL

Paul M. made no bones about the fact that he was impatient, easily irritated and highly demanding of the employees in the health club company that he ran. “It helps me to get more things done and it’s who I am,” he told us. “I just consider myself very direct and very results-oriented. We are a customer-service business, and we live and die by how well we do the little things. If you aren’t willing to hold people accountable, you don’t get excellence.”

保罗大方承认自己急躁、易怒，对健身俱乐部的员工要求严苛。“这样可以帮助我们完成更多的任务。这就是我的风格，从不拐弯抹角，以结果为导向。我们是客户服务行业，细节决定成败。如果不能追责到人，公司就不会有卓越的成绩。”

As we probed more deeply, we asked Paul to look closely at the costs and implications of his management style. Did he, for example, get angry and impatient with vendors and clients? Obviously not, he told us, because doing so would drive customers away. Why then, we asked, did he assume that his attitude wouldn’t have a similarly negative effect on his employees? Why was he willing to treat them in a way that he would never consider treating clients?

随着进一步询问，我们请保罗思考他的管理方式可能产生的后果和影响。比如，他会不会对投资者和客户表现出不耐烦？他告诉我们，显然不会，因为不耐烦会赶跑顾客。我们问他为何认为自己的态度不会对员工产生同样的负面效应？为什么他绝不会这样对待顾客，却如此对待员工？

Paul had arranged to come through our program with his wife, Olivia, and she pointed out to him that he also brought his anger and impatience home. His two children, now twelve and fourteen, were afraid of his outbursts and so, she acknowledged, was she. Olivia reminded him about an incident two years earlier in which his then ten-year-old son had accidentally left his coat on an airplane. Paul became enraged at him. The anger passed quickly but Olivia said that their son had never forgotten the incident. This information had a powerful impact on Paul. He was, he told us, deeply concerned about his long-term relationships with his children. His deepest desire, he realized, was to communicate support and encouragement to his two sons rather than frustration and criticism. Gradually he realized this was true for his employees as well.

保罗在妻子奥莉维亚的陪伴下来到我们的项目。她指出，保罗也将自己的愤怒和焦躁带回了家。 12岁和14岁的儿子都很怕他生气爆发，她也一样。她提到一桩两年前的事件，当时还是10岁的儿子不小心把外套忘在了飞机上，保罗当时就对孩子火冒三丈。虽然他很快就不发火了，但奥莉维亚确定孩子从未忘记过。这件事对保罗触动很大。他告诉我们，他也一直深深担忧自己与孩子之间的关系。他意识到，自己希望两个儿子感受到支持和鼓励，而不是挫败和批判。他渐渐明白，对待员工也是同样的道理。

We began by looking at what factors at the physical level might be influencing Paul’s behavior. As the president of a health-club business, he kept himself in very good physical shape. At the same time, he had long believed that the only way to keep on top of a demanding business and to be a model of commitment was to keep pushing nonstop. To fit in his daily workout, he did it each morning at 5:00 A.M. when he awoke. As he looked more closely at his impatience and reactivity, he realized that they tended to grow throughout the day. We pointed out that the furious pace at which he worked might be a contributing factor. We encouraged him to try moving his workout to midday, not just to sustain his physical capacity but also as a means of getting mental and emotional recovery.

我们开始深入探究，是否有某种身体层面的因素影响了保罗的行为。作为健身俱乐部的老板，他一直保持着傲人身材。同时，他一直坚信，若要在激烈竞争中立于不败之地，兑现承诺，唯一的方式就是不断突破极限。为了保证每天的锻炼量，他从早晨5点起床就开始锻炼。然而当他仔细观察自己的焦躁和处事反应时，发现它们是在一天里慢慢积累起来的。我们认为，他激烈的工作方式或许也是诱因之一。我们鼓励他把健身移到中午，不仅能维持他的体力，还能为思维和情感留出恢复的空间。

Paul was reluctant to take time off in the middle of the day, but he agreed to give it a try. Almost immediately, he discovered that the effect on his energy was significant. He was accustomed to finishing his early morning workouts feeling pumped up, but now the surge of positive energy came at a time of day when he was used to feeling edgier. He found himself facing the afternoons feeling renewed and more positive.

保罗本不愿占用中午的时间，经过我们劝说后勉强同意一试。他立刻就发现，这项改变对精力的影响是显著的。过去，他习惯在早上结束锻炼，带着精神抖擞的面貌开始工作。现在这股正精力在烦躁不安的中午注入，让下午充满了活力，情绪也变得更加积极。

Despite this change, Paul’s habits were deeply ingrained, especially under pressure. With that in mind, he began building a ritual around looking for opportunities throughout the day to strengthen the muscles of patience and kindness. For starters, any time that he found himself waiting in line at an airport, or stuck in traffic, or feeling frustrated with an employee or a family member, he determined to say to himself “Kindness matters.” This simple mantra made him instantly aware of how he wanted to behave under pressure. In effect, it became an opportunity to do some emotional weight lifting.

除此之外，保罗其他的习惯也是根深蒂固的，尤其是在压力之下的反应。因此他决定每天尽量找机会培养耐心和善意，比如在机场排队、遇到堵车、对员工或某位家人不满的时候，他都会告诫自己“心平气和”。这条咒语能让他立刻清醒过来，明白自己该怎样做事。实际上，它变成了锻炼情感能力的机会。

In situations in which Paul’s irritation continued to rise, he took a deep abdominal breath and relaxed the muscles in his shoulders and his face. Doing so helped to short-circuit his fight-or-flight response and reduce his level of arousal. Once he felt less reactive, he tried to think of a way of transforming his initial experience of frustration into an opportunity to make others feel better—most often with self-deprecating humor.

当愤怒逐渐累积时，保罗会选择用腹部做深呼吸，放松肩膀和面部肌肉，掐断自己一触即发的情绪。当情绪逐渐平复下来，他会想办法将沮丧的感觉用一种大家更容易接受的方式表现出来——通常是自嘲的方式。

When Paul felt that it was important to deliver some sort of critical feedback at work, he began using something that we call the “sandwich” technique. He started interactions by making some sort of genuinely positive observation about the person’s performance. Next, he framed his critical feedback not as a lecture but as a discussion, allowing for the possibility that his perception might not be entirely accurate. Finally, he ended with some sort of encouragement. This approach was a way not just to behave with more kindness and consideration, but also to increase the likelihood that what he said would be heard and absorbed without defensiveness.

如果保罗认为有必要提出批评的意见，他会采用 “三明治”技巧。首先真诚地对该员工的良好表现给出正面评价，然后以讨论而非宣讲的形式提出批评意见——因为自己的看法或许并非完全准确，最后以鼓励结尾。用“三明治”的方式提出意见不仅让他看起来充满善意和关怀，而且更容易让员工听取他的建议，不会产生逆反心理。

The habits of a lifetime do not change overnight, but Paul did discover that whenever he was able to short-circuit his impatience or his instant judgments, he felt better about himself. This was so even in situations in which he didn’t get the response he wanted. When he did lose his temper or speak too harshly to someone, he added one more element to his ritual: apologizing and taking responsibility as quickly as possible.

冰冻三尺非一日之寒，但是保罗发现，如果他能控制情绪，不急躁也不武断，心情也会好起来，即使没得到想要的结果时也是如此。如果他没控制住，对某人发脾气或言辞尖刻时，他就会加上另一种仪式习惯：尽快道歉并负起责任。

## HOLDING OPPOSITES

The deepest expression of emotional capacity is the ability to experience a full range of feelings. Because it is so difficult for the mind to hold contradictory impulses, our tendency is to choose up sides, valuing certain emotional skills while neglecting and even disparaging others. We may overvalue toughness and undervalue tenderness, for example, or do just the reverse, when in fact both represent important emotional muscles in our lives. The same is true of many other opposites: self-control and spontaneity, honesty and compassion, generosity and thriftiness, openness and discretion, passion and detachment, patience and urgency, caution and boldness, confidence and humility.

情感容量的最高境界，是足以驾驭所有情感的能力。因为我们的思维很难处理相反的冲动，我们倾向于选择向上的一面，重视某些情绪技巧，忽视甚至看轻另外一些。比如，我们可能过于看重强硬而蔑视温和，也可能恰恰相反，其实，两种品质对情感肌肉同等重要。还有很多互为对立的品质也是如此：比如自控与积极，坦率与感伤，慷慨与节俭，开放与审慎，激情与淡漠，耐心与急迫，谨慎与鲁莽，自信与谦逊等。

Take a moment to consider how broad a range of emotional muscles you have in your own life. In all likelihood you will discover that you have considerably more strength on one side of the spectrum than on the other. Notice, too, the judgment that you bring to the relative merits of opposing qualities. No emotional capacity better serves depth and richness more than the willingness to value feelings that seem contradictory and not to choose up sides between them. To be fully engaged emotionally requires celebrating what the Stoic philosophers called anacoluthia—the mutual entailment of the virtues. By this notion, no virtue is a virtue by itself. Rather, all virtues are entailed. Honesty without compassion, for example, becomes cruelty.

如果花时间评估目前的情绪广度，你很可能会发现自己在某方面的情感肌肉远超出其对立面。请留心你对那些对立品质的评价和态度。只有接受那些看似相反的品质，不逼自己在其间二选一，才有可能获得最深刻最丰富的情感能力。情感层面的全情投入需要遵循斯多葛派哲学家的“破格文体”——美德的共同存在性。从这一角度看来，没有一种美德是不依赖其他品质而成为美德的。所有的美德都有条件。例如，毫不留情的诚实只是残酷而已。

We are, in effect, the sum of our complexities and contradictions. Practically, we must focus on building emotional capacity wherever it is that we are most out of balance. The ultimate goal is to move more freely and flexibly between our own opposites.

我们都是复杂和对立的结合体。因此，我们必须在失衡之前建立足够强大的情感能力。我们的终极目标是能够在对立面之间自由灵活地转换。

## BEAR IN MIND

* In order to perform at our best, we must access pleasant and positive emotions: the experience of enjoyment, challenge, adventure and opportunity. 为了达到最佳表现，我们必须汲取愉悦、积极的情感，享受挑战、冒险和机遇。
* The key muscles fueling positive emotional energy are self-confidence, self-control, interpersonal effectiveness and empathy. 正面情感精力的关键因素是自信、自控、人际关系与共情。
* Negative emotions serve survival but they are very costly and energy inefficient in the context of performance. 负面情感也可以维持我们的生活，但相比于正面情绪代价巨大，事倍功半。
* The ability to summon positive emotions during periods of intense stress lies at the heart of effective leadership. 在高强度压力下调动积极情感的能力是领导力的核心。
* Access to the emotional muscles that serve performance depends on creating a balance between exercising them regularly and intermittently seeking recovery. 利用情感肌肉支配表现，需要依靠定期锻炼和间歇恢复的平衡。
* Any activity that is enjoyable, fulfilling and affirming serves as a source of emotional renewal and recovery. 任何带来享受、令人满足和安心的活动都可以作为情感的再生和恢复方式。
* Emotional muscles such as patience, empathy and confidence can be strengthened in the same way that we strengthen a bicep or a tricep: pushing past our current limits followed by recovery. 练习耐心、共情、自信等情感肌肉的方法与锻炼二头肌或三头肌的方法相同：越过当前的极限，留出充足的恢复空间。
