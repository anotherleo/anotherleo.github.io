# Mental Energy: Appropriate Focus and Realistic Optimism

Just as physical energy is the fundamental fuel for emotional competencies, so it is the fuel for mental skills. Nothing so interferes with performance and engagement as the inability to concentrate on the task at hand. To perform at our best we must be able to sustain concentration, and to move flexibly between broad and narrow, as well as internal and external focus. We also need access to realistic optimism, a paradoxical notion that implies seeing the world as it is, but always working positively toward a desired outcome or solution. Anything that prompts appropriate focus and realistic optimism serves performance. The key supportive muscles that fuel optimal mental energy include mental preparation, visualization, positive self-talk, effective time management, and creativity.

体能精力既是情感能力的基础，也是思维技巧的基础。没有什么比不能集中于手边的工作更能损害工作表现和投入程度了。为了发挥出最好的水平，我们必须保持专注，在整体方向和局部目标之间灵活游走。我们还需要调用现实的乐观主义，一方面看清事物的本质，另一方面还能朝着目标成果积极努力。任何能够调动适当的专注和现实乐观主义的行为，都能服务于良好的表现。优化思维精力的关键因素包括思维准备、构建愿景、积极的自我暗示、高效的时间管理和创造力。

Much as it is true physically and emotionally, mental capacity is derived from a balance between expending and recovering energy. The capacity to stay appropriately focused and realistically optimistic depends on intermittently changing mental channels in order to rest and rejuvenate. When we lack the mental muscles we need to perform at our best—if we have too short an attention span, too pessimistic an outlook, or too rigid and narrow a perspective—we must build capacity by training systematically.

与身体和情感能力相同，思维能力需要平衡消耗和再生。保持专注与乐观的秘诀在于间歇地变换思维频道，达到精力休息和再生的效果。如果缺乏思维肌肉来做到最好——注意力涣散、过于悲观、思维固化、眼光狭窄等，则需要通过系统训练重塑这种能力。

Physical, emotional and mental energy capacity all feed upon one another. At the physical level, the increased fatigue that results from too little sleep or poor fitness makes it more difficult to concentrate. At the emotional level feelings such as anxiety, frustration and anger interfere with focus and undermine optimism, especially in the face of high demand. We first learned these lessons in our work with athletes. One of the most vivid examples occurred in the late 1980s, when Jim received a call from middleweight boxing champion Ray “Boom Boom” Mancini, with whom he was then working.

体能、情感和思维方面的精力都是相辅相成的。在身体层面，睡眠太少或亚健康导致的疲倦使得注意力难以集中；在情感层面，焦虑、挫败和愤怒的情绪也会干扰注意力，损害乐观心态，尤其是面临高度压力的情况时。我们最初从与我们合作的运动员身上发现了这条规律。最生动的案例发生在20世纪80年代末，有一天吉姆接到中量级拳击冠军曼奇尼打来的电话。他们当时正在一起合作。

“I’m really concerned,” Mancini said. “I had a negative thought in the ring today.”

“我真的很担心，”曼奇尼说，“今天我在赛场上产生了一个消极的想法。”

“Just one negative thought?” Jim answered, a little incredulous.

“只是一个消极的想法？”吉姆答道，觉得有点难以置信。

“You don’t understand, Doc,” Mancini said. “A single negative thought is what gets you hit in the face.”

“你不明白，博士。”曼奇尼说。“一个消极想法足够让你被一拳打倒了。”

In a less dramatic way, the same is true in other performance venues. Psychologist Martin Seligman spent several years studying the relationship between positive thinking and sales success. Seligman developed an instrument called the Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ) to assess people’s levels of optimism. This test was given to a large group of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company salesmen. When scores were matched to actual sales records, it turned out that agents who scored in the top half for optimism sold 37 percent more insurance over two years than those in the more pessimistic bottom half. More notable still, agents who scored in the top 10 percent for optimism sold 88 percent more than those ranked in the most pessimistic 10 percent. Agents who scored in the bottom 50 percent on the same test were twice as likely to leave their jobs as their more optimistic counterparts, while those in the bottom 25 percent were three times as likely to quit.

其他衡量表现的场合虽说没这么夸张，但同样适用。心理学家马丁·塞利格曼用数年时间研究了正向思考和销售业绩之间的关系。他开发了一份归因方式问卷（ASQ）来衡量人们的乐观程度。他向大都会人寿保险公司的销售员发放了这份问卷，并将个人得分结果与其销售业绩进行比对，结果发现乐观得分排名在前50%的销售员在两年间比排名得分后50%的销售员多售出37%的保险额。乐观得分排名前10%的销售员与后10%的销售员业绩差距更大，前者比后者多售出88%的保险额。而乐观得分排名在后50%的销售员离职率比得分前50%的销售员离职率高一倍，排名最后25%的销售员则比排名前25%的销售员辞职率高出2倍。

In our terms, it is the mental energy derived from positive thinking—what Seligman calls “optimistic explanatory style”—that drives the persistence of a successful salesman. Of course, it doesn’t always serve us well to put a positive spin on events. Negative thoughts may help to direct our attention to important needs that aren’t being met—whether for food, rest, emotional support or a danger that lurks on the horizon. To the extent that we listen to these signals and address them as quickly as possible, they serve a useful role in our lives. It is also important to be able to accurately assess situations and to avoid those in which the outcome is very likely to be negative or destructive. But this instinct is different than pessimism, which colors any perception and tends to be defensive rather than solution-based. When it comes to the everyday challenge of performance, the energy of negative thinking is almost invariably undermining and counterproductive. Realistic optimism better serves most of the challenges we face.

在我们看来，正向思考产生的思维精力，即塞利格曼所说“乐观的理解方式”——造就了成功销售员坚忍不拔的品性。的确，正向思维并不总是能够带来期待的结果。消极思维也可以帮我们留意到被忽视的重要需求——不论是食物、休息、情感支持或者眼前的危险。此时，我们接到信号并尽快做出反应，它们也可以变得很有益处。准确评估情况、避免消极或破坏性后果同样重要。但这种直觉并非悲观，悲观者戴着有色眼镜观察世界，强调自我防备而非解决问题。面对每天接踵而至的挑战，消极思维会不可避免带来损害，起到相反效果。现实乐观主义能够解决我们面临的大多数挑战。

## THINKING ASIDE

Perhaps nowhere do we so undervalue the importance of intermittent recovery as in the mental dimension of our lives. In most work environments, the message—both explicit and implicit—is that working longer and more continuously is the best route to high productivity. We aren’t rewarded for taking regular breaks, or for building a workout into the middle of a day, or for any pattern of work other than keeping our heads down and grinding away for as long as we can.

在思维维度，我们也许最容易低估间歇再生的重要性。世界上绝大多数工作环境都充斥着一条或明显或隐晦的信息——长时间连续工作是高产出的最佳途径。按时休息不会受到奖励，在白天抽时间活动不会得到赞扬，只有低着脑袋刻苦钻研才会受到肯定。

The problem is that thinking uses up a great deal of energy. The brain represents just 2 percent of the body’s weight, but requires almost 25 percent of its oxygen. The consequences of insufficient mental recovery range from increased mistakes of judgment and execution to lower creativity and a failure to take reasonable account of risks. The key to mental recovery is to give the conscious, thinking mind intermittent rest.

但是，思考会耗费巨大的精力。只占体重的2%大脑需要人体25%的氧气供给。如果思维得不到足够的恢复，会判断失误、创造力减弱、或无法合理评估风险。思维恢复的关键是让正常工作的大脑间歇地休息。

In his provocative book, How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci, author Michael Gelb poses a wonderfully revealing question: “Where are you when you get your best ideas?” Gelb has asked this question to thousands of people over the years, and the most common answers he gets include “in the shower,” “resting in bed,” “walking in nature” and “listening to music.” We ask our own clients a similar question and their answers have ranged from taking a jog to meditating to dreaming to sitting on the beach. “Almost no one,” Gelb writes, “claims to get their best ideas at work.”

引起热议的《如何像达·芬奇一样思考》一书中，作者迈克尔·葛柏提出了颇具深意的问题：“什么场合你会获得最佳的灵感？”经过多年的收集，最普遍的答案包括“沐浴的时候”“躺床上休息”“在自然中散步”和“听音乐”。我们也问过客户类似的问题，他们的回答有慢跑、冥想、做梦和海边度假等。“但是几乎没人声称自己在工作中会获得最佳灵感。”葛柏总结道。

Prolific and productive as Leonardo da Vinci was, Gelb points out, the artist took regular breaks from his work. Rather than sleeping extended hours at night, he relied on numerous catnaps during the day. While da Vinci was working on The Last Supper, he sometimes spent several hours in the middle of the day appearing to be lost in daydreams, in spite of entreaties from his employer, the prior of Santa Maria delle Grazie, to work more steadily. “The greatest geniuses,” da Vinci told his patron, “sometimes accomplish more when they work less.” In his Treatise on Painting, da Vinci wrote, “It is a very good plan every now and then to go away and have a little relaxation. . . . When you come back to the work your judgment will be surer, since to remain constantly at work will cause you to lose the power of judgment.”

葛柏指出，像达·芬奇那样创造力丰富又多产的艺术家也需要定期放下工作。他并非依靠延长夜间睡眠做到这一点，而是利用白天里的小憩。达·芬奇在创作《最后的晚餐》期间，为了保持稳定的产出，有时会在白天花几个小时做梦，无视他的雇主——圣母感恩教堂副院长的催促。达·芬奇告诉他的客户：“最伟大的天才，有时工作越少，成果越出色。”在《论绘画》中他也写道：“时不时离开工作放松一下是个非常好的习惯……当你回到工作时，做出的判断会更加准确。而持续工作会降低你的判断力。”

## CREATIVITY AND RECOVERY

Oscillation also permits different parts of the brain to be activated. The neurosurgeon Roger Sperry won a Nobel Prize in 1967 for research in which he established that the two hemispheres of the brain have fundamentally different ways of processing information. The left hemisphere is the seat of language and operates in a sequential, step-by-step, time-conscious way, arriving at conclusions based on logical deductions. Sperry’s breakthrough was his discovery that the right hemisphere has unique and often underappreciated qualities of its own. It is more visually and spatially adept and has a greater capacity to see things all at once and to relate the parts to the whole. Because the right hemisphere is less linear and time-focused than the left, it is more inclined to solve problems by intuitive leap and sudden insight.

神经外科专家罗杰·斯佩里1967年获诺贝尔科学奖，他的研究揭示了大脑的两个半球在信息处理方面存在本质的差别。左半球坐落着语言神经，有条理、按次序地工作，通过逻辑推演得出结论。斯佩里突破性地发现：大脑右半球拥有独特的能力，却常常被低估，它更擅长视觉化和空间概念，有更强的全局观，能将事物的部分与整体联系起来。由于右半球不如左半球那样单线化、对时间敏感，因此它更容易凭借直觉和顿悟处理问题。

Sperry’s work helps to explain why our best ideas often occur when we seem not to be consciously seeking solutions. Equally important, intermittent right-hemisphere dominance seems to provide a powerful form of recovery from the rational, analytic left-hemisphere mode that occupies most of our time at work.

斯佩里的发现解释了灵感为何往往发生在最不刻意寻找答案的瞬间。同样，间歇地让右脑主持大局，可以让我们从占据我们多数工作时间的左脑理性分析模式中脱离，得到有效恢复。

The creative process itself is oscillatory. Beginning with the German physiologist and physicist Hermann Helmholtz in the late nineteenth century, many thinkers have sought to define the sequential steps of the creative process. Five stages are now widely recognized: first insight, saturation, incubation, illumination and verification. In her books Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain and Drawing on the Artist Within, writer and art professor Betty Edwards has written brilliantly about the way that creativity involves cycling between the left and right hemisphere modes of thinking.

创造的过程本身具有波动性。从19世纪末的德国生理学家和心理学家赫尔曼·赫姆霍兹开始，许多学者都在尝试定义创造活动的步骤。现在最为广泛接受的是五步论：洞察、汲取、孵育、启示和验证。在《调动正确的大脑》和《唤醒内心的艺术家》中，作家、艺术教授贝蒂·爱德华兹敏锐地指出，创造需要调动左右半脑交替思考。

Two of the stages of creativity clearly depend more on logical, analytical left-hemisphere skills. In saturation, information is gathered in a methodical, step-by-step way from multiple sources. The final stage, verification, relies on analyzing, codifying and translating the creative breakthrough into rational, accessible language. The other three stages—first insight (the initial inspiration), incubation (mulling over the ideas), and illumination (the breakthrough)—are all associated with the right hemisphere. All three tend to occur when we are doing something that Edwards calls “thinking aside”—not actively seeking answers or results. “In each of these stages,” she writes, “the creative work occurs largely at an unconscious level—and often after the left hemisphere’s conscious, rational search for a solution has been exhausted.” In short, the highest form of creativity depends on a rhythmic movement between engagement and disengagement, thinking and letting go, activity and rest. Both sides of the equation are necessary, but neither is sufficient by itself.

五个步骤中，有两个明显需要使用左半脑的逻辑化和分析能力：汲取，即依照系统的步骤从众多信息来源中收集有用信息，最后一步——验证，即依靠分析和整理，将创造成果翻译成条理分明、通俗易懂的语言。其他三个步骤——洞察（灵感）、孵育（斟酌）和启示（突破）都与右脑相关，并且经常在我们无意寻找答案或解决方法时发生。爱德华兹称其为“边缘型思考”。“在这些阶段，创造大部分是无意识发生的，而且通常产生在左脑有意识地、理性地寻求解决方案之后。”简而言之，创造的最高形式依靠的是投入与抽离、思考与放松、活跃与休息之间有节奏的交替。等式的两边都很重要，缺少任何一项等式都不能成立。

## JAKE T.: MENTAL STALENESS

At age thirty-five, Jake T. ran a boutique marketing and advertising firm that he had founded. It was known for its novel, high-visibility campaigns for products aimed at younger Gen X and Gen Y consumers. After a long string of successes, the company had been hit by the combination of a declining economy and sudden competition from larger companies who had been slow to recognize a market opportunity. Energetic and ambitious by temperament, Jake responded by pushing himself and his people harder to break new creative ground. To his surprise and frustration, his efforts were proving counterproductive. Longer hours and more intense commitment weren’t translating into more creative output. Jake came to us because he felt personally frustrated and exhausted and because the key members of his young team seemed to have lost their edge as well.

杰克在35岁时便开办了自己的精品营销广告公司，因其针对年青的X一代和Y一代顾客设计的新锐广告享有盛誉。然而，长期的成功之后，公司业绩被经济衰退所累，晚一步意识到市场机遇的大型公司也纷纷插手市场，竞争日益激烈。杰克充满活力又野心勃勃，面对与日俱增的压力，他做出的回应是逼迫自己和员工更加努力地工作，以求开辟新的创意天地。令他惊讶和失望的是，他们的努力成效甚微。长时间的工作并没有等量转化为创意成果。他疲惫又沮丧地找到我们，还认为年轻团队中的骨干都失去了敏锐的洞察力。

Given the firm’s exceptional earlier success, it was clear that the problem wasn’t a lack of talent or skill—either in Jake’s case or more broadly in the organization. It struck us that he was effectively trying too hard—pushing himself relentlessly to be more creative and productive, and doing the same to his staff. We suggested to Jake that he was spending too much mental energy without sufficient recovery, and that the answer might be to build in more down time to think in different ways, and to allow ideas to percolate. What activities outside work, we asked, did he especially enjoy? Jake came up with several, although he admitted that he loved his work above all, and that he had spent very little time on anything else during the past several years.

鉴于公司曾在前期大获成功，很显然问题并非是出在才能或技能方面——既不在杰克自己也不在公司整体。我们认为，他显然过于努力了，无休止地逼迫自己创新、产出，对下属也是这样。我们告诉杰克，他耗费了太多思维精力，却没有充分恢复，或许多给自己一些时间放松，从不同的角度看待问题，灵感就会流动起来。我们问他，除了工作还有什么兴趣爱好？杰克说自己爱工作胜过一切，过去几年中几乎没空做其他事情，不过他最终还是记起了一些曾经的爱好。

Up through college, Jake had aspirations to be a painter, only to give it up completely when he concluded that he didn’t have the goods to make a living at it. Even so, he remembered painting as a source of immense pleasure, something that he found both challenging and deeply absorbing. With our encouragement, Jake decided to buy new supplies and take up painting again. He was too tired to paint when he got home at night, but he loved the idea of waking up early and spending an hour or two in front of the easel in the mornings. It cleared his mind of the pressures at work and shifted him into the right-hemisphere mode that facilitates creativity. On several occasions, ideas for marketing campaigns occurred to him while he was painting. He also found that he was looser and more imaginative during the first several morning hours at work.

直到读大学之前，杰克一直梦想成为一名画家，只是在意识到自己无法靠画笔谋生后就完全放弃了。即便如此，他还记得沉浸在绘画中的快乐。在我们的鼓励下，杰克决定买些设备，重拾画笔。晚上回到家时，他已经累得基本不想作画了，不过他很喜欢在早晨花一两个小时与画架为伴，绘画会帮助他释放工作的压力，充分调动了他的右脑，发挥创造力。营销方案灵感好几次就在他画画的时候浮现出来。他也发现，画画之后的上午自己会更加放松，创意也更多了。

The second form of recovery that Jake embraced was yoga. A basketball player during high school and college, he retained his passion for the game through his twenties, but gave it up in his thirties partly in response to the demands of work and partly because he got tired of dealing with jammed fingers, twisted ankles and sprained knees. Jake had done a good deal of yoga during college—his basketball coach used it as a stretching exercise—and he was reintroduced to the practice during his training with us. Like many of our clients, he found it relaxing mentally and emotionally, and energizing physically. He began building two “yoga” breaks into his workday—ten to fifteen minutes when he closed his office door and did a half dozen postures. He found them so rejuvenating, especially in the afternoons, that it occurred to him that others in the firm might have the same experience.

第二种杰克喜欢的放松方式是练瑜伽。作为高中和大学的篮球运动员，整个青春时期他对篮球保持了极高的热情，跨入30岁的门槛后就放弃了，一部分因为工作需要，一部分因为他厌倦了伤痛——手指夹伤，脚踝扭伤，膝盖擦伤，诸如此类。大学时期杰克就接触过瑜伽——他的篮球教练用瑜伽动作帮运动员们拉筋，但直到跟我们合作，他才开始系统地学习。同我们的许多客户一样，他认为瑜伽可以放松思维、平复情绪，令身体焕发活力。他开始练习工作时每天做两次瑜伽。虽然仅仅是关上门，花10～15分钟做几个动作，却让他整个面貌焕然一新，尤其是下午的时候。他开始思考，公司的其他员工是否也能从瑜伽练习中受益。

Jake decided to set aside a room at the office just for yoga and meditation, and he even offered to teach a class once a week. Even on the days that he was traveling, he built in time for yoga, in the early morning and before dinner and at the end of his workday. He also bought a Ping-Pong table for the office and he encouraged people to get out for lunch and leave their work behind. Following up on one of our principles, he told his staff that he was less interested in how much time they devoted to their jobs than in the quality of energy they brought to their tasks.

杰克决定在公司里腾出一间屋子作为瑜伽和冥想专用室，还每周一次亲自上阵教授瑜伽课程。即使出差在外，他也保持着做瑜伽的习惯，每天清早、晚饭前和临睡前共3次练习。他为公司购置了一台乒乓球桌，还鼓励人们放下工作，外出午餐。他把我们的研究结论传授给员工，告诉他们，相比于在工作中投入的时间，他更看重他们工作时投入的精力。

Jake worried at first that he was taking a risk in encouraging his employees to build intermittent breaks into their days. Some of them might take advantage of his new policy simply to slack off. But he also reasoned that selectively slacking off might actually fuel their creativity. In his own case, taking time for painting before work and building yoga into his days significantly changed both the quality and the quantity of his energy and his productivity. It not only increased his capacity for focus when he was working, but it seemed to open access to a whole new level of creativity.

起初，杰克担心这种鼓励可能会让员工在工作中找空休息，或许还会有人利用他的新政策偷懒。不过他同时也想到，选择性地偷懒也许会给他们带来更多灵感。以自己为例，上班前作画和日间瑜伽都极大提升了他的精力水平，不仅让他在工作时更加专注，还为他打开了一扇通往更丰富创造力的大门。

Over the next several months, the atmosphere in the company changed noticeably, Jake told us. It became looser, more playful and more spirited—not unlike its earliest days when there were a half dozen employees seeking to build a new business rather than seventy trying to sustain one. Jake himself felt rejuvenated and the imaginativeness of the company’s marketing campaigns soared. Their work reacquired a buzz in the industry. It was, Jake believed, as if the whole company had awakened from a slumber.

杰克告诉我们，接下来的几个月里，公司的氛围有了明显变化，更加轻松、有趣、生机勃勃，不再是前期的状态，现在多数人在外寻找新业务，而不是一群人苦苦留住一个客户。杰克觉得重获新生，营销方案的想象力一飞冲天。他们的作品重新得到了业界的关注，杰克觉得，仿佛整个公司都从梦游中醒了过来。

## THE PLASTICITY OF THE BRAIN

Increasing evidence confirms that the brain itself operates like a muscle—atrophying from disuse and increasing in capacity with active use, even late in life. At Baylor College of Medicine, a research team spent four years studying nearly one hundred physically healthy people over the age of sixty-four. One third of them still had jobs. One third had retired but remained active physically and mentally. The final third had retired and were essentially inactive. After four years, the third group scored significantly lower than the first two, not just on IQ tests but also on those measuring blood flow to their brains. As neurologist Richard Restak puts it: “No matter how old you may be at this moment, it’s never too late to change your brain for the better. That’s because the brain is different from every other organ in our body. While the liver and the lungs and the kidneys wear out after a certain number of years, the brain gets sharper the more it’s used. Indeed it improves with use.”

越来越多证据表明，大脑的运作方式也类似肌肉——积极使用能够提升能力，使用不足就会萎缩。贝勒医学院的研究小组用4年时间研究了100名年龄超过64岁的健康人群，其中三分之一的人还在工作，三分之一的人退休了但仍保持身体和思维的活跃，还有三分之一的人退休后就不再保持活跃的状态。四年之后，第三组人群不仅智商明显低于前两组，大脑血液测试得分也同样低于前两组。正如神经学家理查德·雷斯塔克所说：“不管你处于哪个年龄阶段，都可以持续地优化大脑，与其他身体器官不同，肝脏、肺和肾使用过度会发生损耗，而大脑只会因为使用而日益敏锐，越磨越利。”

Because the mind and body are so inextricably connected, even moderate physical exercise can increase cognitive capacity. It does so most simply by driving more blood and oxygen to the brain. Exercise is also believed to stimulate more production of a chemical—brain-derived neurotrophic factor—which helps repair brain cells and prevent further damage. A research team at the University of Illinois set out to test the cognitive functioning of 124 women ages sixty to seventy-five who never or rarely exercised. The women were put on a three-day-a-week program that included either a brisk one-hour walk or an hour of gentle yoga-style stretching. In effect the exercisers were asked to push past their comfort zones physically, while the stretchers were not. After just six months, the walkers demonstrated 25 percent higher scores than the stretchers on a series of key cognitive tests. In a similar experiment, a Japanese neuroscientist put a group of young people on a jogging program of thirty minutes, two to three times a week. When he tested them at the end of twelve weeks on a series of memory skills, their scores significantly increased, and so did the speed with which they completed the tests. Of equal note, their gains disappeared almost immediately when they stopped jogging.

由于思维和身体不可分割的特性，即使适度的身体锻炼也能增强认知能力，原理很简单，锻炼身体能将更多的血液和氧气输送到大脑。人们还相信锻炼能够刺激一种化学物质——大脑分泌的神经营养因子——的产生，它能帮助修复脑部细胞，防止其进一步受损。伊利诺伊大学的研究小组测试了124名年龄在60～75岁的女性的认知能力，这些女性平日很少或几乎不锻炼身体。小组安排受试者参加每周三次的健身项目，健身形式为1小时快步走或轻度瑜伽拉伸。快步走的受试者需要在体能层面突破自己的舒适区，而瑜伽组则不需。仅仅6个月之后，快走组在一系列关键性的认知测试中的得分就比瑜伽组高出25%。在日本也有类似的实验。一名神经科学家安排一群年轻人参加半小时的慢跑项目，每周两到三次。12周后再次测量受试者的一系列的记忆技巧，他们的得分有了明显提高，答题速度也明显加快。值得注意的是，这个神奇的效果在人们终止慢跑锻炼时几乎就立刻消失了。

Epidemiologist David Snowden’s nuns study suggests that ongoing intellectual activity wards off deterioration. No single factor better predicted the risk of eventual Alzheimer’s, for example, than the density of ideas and the grammatical complexity of the biographical essays that nuns in the study wrote about themselves in their twenties. More compelling still, Snowden found that nuns who taught for most of their lives showed significantly less mental decline than those who had devoted themselves to less intellectually challenging forms of service.

流行病学家大卫·斯诺登的修女实验说明，持续的智力活动可以预防大脑退化。参与研究的修女需要写一篇文章，描述自己从20多岁到现在的生活，没有比讲述故事和使用复杂语法更能有效地预测阿兹海默症发病风险了。斯诺登还发现了更有说服力的证据，大部分时间献给传授事业的修女相比从事低智力挑战任务的修女，思维衰退要缓慢得多。

Much as it is true physically and emotionally, the balance of stress and recovery appears to be a critical factor in maximizing cognitive capacity. Exposing one’s self to short-term stress, for example, can stimulate a burst of adrenaline that actually improves memory. When the demand is more linear and chronic—and stress hormones continue to circulate in the brain—the hippocampus can actually shrink. Much like the body, the brain needs time to recover from exertion. After we have learned new information or had new experiences, it takes time for the brain to consolidate and encode what it has learned. In the absence of downtime, or recovery, this learning cannot take place as efficiently.

我们在体能层面和情感层面已经验证了压力和恢复平衡的重要性，它同时也是拓展认知能力的重要组成部分。将自己置于短暂的压力中，可以刺激肾上腺素分泌，从而提高记忆力。如果面对长时间周而复始的需求，压力荷尔蒙在大脑中持续循环，海马体反而会萎缩。与身体一样，思维也需要从精力消耗中恢复。我们学习新知识或产生新体验之后，大脑需要一定时间将所学东西巩固、编码。如果大脑没有得到充足的恢复或休息，这个学习过程的效率就会降低。

Loss of memory is the most common complaint that people over the age of forty bring to neurologists. Far more often than not, the explanation is not disease, but rather the failure to actively keep the mind engaged, and the resulting atrophy of the “muscles” of memory. Much as is the case physically, disuse feeds on itself. When we are young and our brains are highly plastic, learning even complex skills such as language is relatively easy. As we get older, and exercise these muscles less, the challenge of learning a new language or a new skill tends to be more difficult and frustrating. To avoid discomfort (and in some cases humiliation) our inclination is to give up. The result is that the avoidable deterioration of our capacity continues.

记忆衰退是40岁以上的人经常向神经科医生提出的问题，而这个问题通常并非疾病引起，而是思维不够活跃导致记忆“肌肉”萎缩。年轻人的思维具有很强的可塑性，学习一门新语言之类的复杂过程都轻而易举。随着年龄的增长，思维肌肉的调动越来越少，学习新语言或新技能就变得更加困难，带来了加倍的挫折感。为了避免不适感（有时是避免丢脸），人们很容易放弃，结果导致本可避免的大脑退化进一步加重。

“Every time you learn something new it builds new connections to the brain cells,” says Margery Silver, assistant professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and associate director of the New England Centenarian study, “That way if you do have a few changes—a few plaques and tangles associated with Alzheimer’s and a few brain cells become damaged, you still have a reserve because of all these additional connections you built up.” Put another way, continuing to challenge the brain protects us from decline as we age. Just as learning a new sport forces us to build new muscles and to use our bodies in different ways, so learning new computer skills, or taking a new course, or even learning a few new words of vocabulary each day pushes us to develop the mental muscles that serve performance.

“每当人们学习新事物，都会建立起大脑细胞新的联结。”哈佛医学院心理学助理教授，新英格兰百岁人瑞研究副总监玛杰里·西尔弗说。“即便你已经出现老化的征兆——牙菌斑、神经纤维缠结（与阿兹海默症相关）、部分大脑细胞受损，你仍旧可以依靠这些新联结挽救部分脑细胞。”换句话说，持续挑战大脑能够预防老龄带来的退化。学习新的体育活动会帮助我们打造新的肌肉，锻炼不同的身体部位，学习新的电脑技能、新课程、甚至每天记几个新单词都能帮助我们锻炼思维肌肉，更好地为效能表现服务。

## ALICE P.: PESSIMISM, NEGATIVITY

A partner in a middle-size law firm, Alice had an almost unerring eye for what might go wrong in any situation. She could pick up the one small grammatical error in an otherwise flawless thirty-page brief. She could spot a small shortcoming in the most desirable candidate for a job. She could find good reasons not to take on a new client or to expand the size of the firm or even to hold a Christmas party. This capacity made her a one-woman insurance policy against disaster. It also made her the purveyor of a relentlessly critical and pessimistic energy—the sort of person no one wanted to spend much time around. Worse, her negativity was so predictable that over time her colleagues began to discount her point of view.

作为一家中型律师事务所的合伙人之一，爱丽丝能够发现任何出错或可能出错的地方。她可以从一份长达30页、近乎完美的简报中挑出唯一的一处语法错误，在某个职位的最佳候选人身上看到小缺点，找到充分的理由不接某位新客户，不扩张事务所规模，甚至不举办圣诞派对。这项特别的能力让她成为灾难前的唯一保险，也让她成为挑剔和消极精力的无尽来源，所有人都不愿接近她。更不幸的是，因为几乎可以预见她的反对，同事们开始看轻她的意见。

Alice continued to believe that she was the only person in her company willing to look squarely at the truth. It never occurred to her in some cases her approach might be only one part of the truth or that by focusing so narrowly on specific issues, she might be losing sight of the larger picture. Nor did she take into account the impact that her negative energy had on her own effectiveness or on others.

爱丽丝一直相信自己是公司里唯一愿意直面现实的人。她从没想过，某些情况下或许自己看到的只是事实的一部分，可能因为太关注具体问题反而失去了全局观。她从未考虑过负面精力对自己或他人的工作效率的影响。

Alice’s first breakthrough in working with us was the recognition that she was stuck in one limited way of looking at the world—namely negatively. It robbed her of much satisfaction or joy, not just at work but also in her personal life. If she went on a vacation with her husband and two teenage sons, she admitted, she was the one who found something wrong with the hotel room or the food or the weather. If one of her sons came home with an A on a test, she immediately focused on a subject in which he wasn’t doing as well. If her other son scored a touchdown for his high school football team but sustained a small ankle injury, she focused on the dangers of football rather than her - son’s success.

与我们合作后，爱丽丝的第一项突破是认识到自己看待事物的片面性。负面思维已经剥夺了她工作和生活中的乐趣。她与丈夫和两个青春期的儿子去度假，她总能在酒店房间、食物和天气上挑出毛病来。儿子在某科考试里得了“优”，她会首先注意到没得优的科目。孩子为学校橄榄球队触地得分却小小扭伤脚踝，她在意的却是橄榄球运动的危险性而不是孩子的成功。

Over time, Alice built a series of routines to mobilize more positive solution-based thinking. None so affected the pattern of her thinking as the ritual that she instituted in the mornings when she woke up. To start each day, she wrote down in a journal everything that she felt was going wrong in her life, or might go wrong. These might range from “The brief I’m writing isn’t going well” to “I said the wrong thing to a client today and jeopardized our relationship” to “The associate on this case just can’t cut it, and he’s wasting my time.”

为了扭转局面，我们为爱丽丝建立了一系列习惯，帮助她调动正向思维。其中最有效的是早上醒来之后的行动，新的一天开始之前，她会写下所有感觉会出错或者可能出错的事物，内容可能是“简报写得不太好”“我对客户说错话了，把关系搞砸了”或者“那个案子的助理别再喋喋不休了，简直是浪费我的时间”等等。

Next, Alice tried to step back from the perceived crisis and recast it not as a catastrophe and a threat but as a challenge and an opportunity. In effect, this became a weight-training session for realistic optimism. If it was the brief she was worrying about, she might focus on the fact that she had written dozens of them before and that struggling was a necessary part of the process of getting it right. If she was worried about a client, she might remind herself that she already had a long relationship in place and that the misstep created an opportunity to learn and to be more effective in the future. If it was the work of an associate she felt upset about, she might focus on his strengths and take pleasure in the chance to serve as a mentor and pass along her considerable knowledge.

下一步，爱丽丝试图从自己预见的危机中走出来，调整思维角度，将其看作挑战和机遇，而不是灾难或威胁。这就是现实乐观主义训练系统的一部分。如果她在担心简报，就应该想到，自己已经写过几十份简报，心理纠结只是尽善尽美的一部分。如果她在担心客户，就应该提醒自己这段客户关系已经建立了很久，小失误也创造了一次学习的机会。如果对助理不满，则应该关注别人的长处，并乐意为别人提供指导，传授自己的方法。

In order to feel more secure, Alice decided it was critical to create an escape hatch for situations that she believed, even after reflection, merited concern and skepticism. In those instances, she asked herself the question, “What is the worst-case scenario here? If everything that could go wrong did go wrong, could I live with the consequences?” In nearly every case, she discovered that she could, which she found reassuring. This lowered her level of urgency and allowed her to make her suggestions in less apocalyptic terms.

为了获得更多的安全感，爱丽丝认为有必要为潜在的危机安排紧急出口，即使在进行正面积极的考虑之后。在这些情况下，她会问自己：“最坏的情况是什么？如果有可能出错的地方都出错了，后果是否可以接受？”几乎每次的答案都是肯定的，这让她感到非常宽慰。事情的严重程度降低了，她的表述方式也会缓和起来。

Alice ended her early morning ritual by focusing on those aspects of her life for which she felt thankful and appreciative. No part of - Alice’s ritual was more satisfying than this one. It helped her to appreciate how extraordinarily fortunate she was in nearly every aspect of her life—the fact that she had her health, reasonable financial security, a husband and two sons she loved as well as a job that she still found challenging.

每天早晨，爱丽丝的仪式习惯都以生命中值得感恩的事物结束。这一部分最让她满足，她在提醒自己足够幸运的事实——身体健康，衣食无忧，爱自己的丈夫和两个儿子，还有充满挑战性的工作。

On most mornings, this exercise prompted a welcome shift in - Alice’s energy. Physically, she became more relaxed. Emotionally, she felt more hopeful. Mentally, she became less distracted, more flexible and better able to concentrate. These experiences fed on one another, prompting a greater sense of engagement in her work. In time, this process became an almost automatic response to any persistent negative thought. Only when the pressures were unusually high did it become necessary for Alice to take herself more formally through this morning exercise.

大多数的早晨，这种思想锻炼可以提高爱丽丝的精力水平，让她的身体更加放松，情绪更加积极，思维更加灵活、容易专注。这些改善引发了连锁效应，她能更好地集中在工作上。后来，这个思维过程被她拿来应对每个挥之不去的负面想法。只有她压力过大时，才需要在早晨正式地做完整套模式。

In effect, Alice redirected the energy she had been devoting to spotting what was wrong with the world and began applying it instead to looking for what was right. Retaining the option to raise a red flag at times kept her from feeling like a Polyanna. Under pressure, her highly critical eye and her pessimism sometimes resurfaced, but rarely for long. For the first time in her adult life, she felt fueled by possibility rather than by fear.

爱丽丝也将曾经用来挑错的精力用于寻找正确的解决方案，不时举起的红旗帮助她避开盲目乐观的陷阱。面对压力时，她的批判眼光和悲观主义偶尔也会钻出来，但是不会持续很久。这是她成年之后第一次感到，自己的人生不是被恐惧追赶，而是为了挑战各种可能性主动前进。

## SARA D.: POOR TIME MANAGEMENT, LOW ATTENTION SPAN

Sara D. worked as a hospital administrator and fought what she felt was a losing battle for control over her life. At thirty-five, she was single and lived alone. The fact that she didn’t have family responsibilities gave her the freedom to work as many hours as she chose. It also made it very hard for her to leave her office at the end of the day. A problem solver by instinct, she was the one to whom everyone seemed to turn in a crisis. The result was that her time never felt like her own. Mail, memos and unfinished projects piled high on her desk. Sara told us that she admired both efficiency and creativity, and that because she had so little of the former, she seemed to find no time for the latter.

莎拉是一名医院行政人员，她感觉生活正在渐渐偏离她的掌控方向。她今年35岁，单身独居。因为没有家庭负担，她可以自由决定下班时间，结果，她待在办公室的时间越来越长。作为解决问题的专业人士，所有人遇到麻烦都找她，导致她的时间从来不归自己支配，邮件、备忘录和未处理文件在桌子上堆起小山。莎拉说，她也很提倡高效和创新，但是因为自己缺乏效率，始终没有时间搞创新。

Time management, we tell our clients, is not an end in itself. Rather it serves the higher goal of effective energy management. Because we have a limited number of hours in a day, we must not only make intelligent choices about how to use them but must also insure that we have the energy available to invest in our highest priorities. Too often, we devote our time to activities that don’t advance our mission, depleting our energy reserves in the process. Stephen Covey captures this deftly in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People when he describes how often the urgent in our lives—what seems most demanding in the moment—crowds out the important—priorities that are ultimately more consequential, but don’t necessarily require immediate attention. The same is true of many corporate cultures, where a constant sense of emergency makes it difficult for anyone to step back and make more thoughtful choices.

时间管理只是通向高效精力管理的途径。每天的时间是固定的，不仅要聪明地使用时间，更要确保有限的精力用于最重要的事物。但是人们往往花大把时间做无益的事，耗费大量精力。史蒂芬·柯维在《高效能人士的七个习惯》里准确地描述了这一点：看似紧急的琐事总会盖过那些非常重要却不太急迫的事。这也是许多企业的通病，人们很难在紧迫感面前停下脚步，做出更加深思熟虑的抉择。

Urgency was precisely Sara’s issue. Fiercely action oriented, she was forever reacting to the demands of others. Phone calls, emails, and people arriving at her door with pressing concerns consumed her energy all day long. Creative brainstorming, reflection and attending to longer-range planning and writing projects all tended to get pushed aside. Partly the issue was her attention span. Like many of our clients, Sara found it difficult to concentrate on any one subject for long. While she took a certain pride in her multitasking ability—answering email while she talked on the phone, for example—the result was that she rarely gave all of her attention to anything. Her staff had learned that if an issue couldn’t be summarized in a few bullet points, Sara - wasn’t likely to absorb it. Unfortunately, not every issue lends itself to simple resolution. This is especially true when it comes to people’s personal issues, rather than specific tasks. Although she was nurturing by nature, Sara was increasingly perceived as rushed and unavailable.

紧迫感就是莎拉的问题所在。她的行动力超强，时刻都在回应他人的需求——电话、邮件，还有随时到桌前寻求帮助的人，无时不刻地消耗着她有限的精力。而创造性的思维风暴、自我反省、长期规划和写作计划都被一再拖延。她的专注力对这样的结果负有一部分责任。像我们许多客户一样，她很难长期专注在一件事物上。虽然她自豪于一心多用的本领，比如一边打电话一边写邮件，却对任何事情都无法投入百分之百的精力。她的同事也发现，莎拉只对清晰简明的列表有理解能力。很遗憾的是并非所有事情都有清晰简明的解决方案，尤其牵涉到私人问题的时候。即便本性并非如此，在别人眼中，莎拉渐渐成为急躁而忙碌的形象。

The first ritual that Sara decided to launch was to spend twenty to thirty minutes when she awoke in the mornings shifting her attention from her usual external focus to an internal one. She wrote in a journal about issues both at work and in her personal life. Writing helped her to feel that she wasn’t simply a work machine, and it also gave her a chance to reflect on her relationships, on and off the job. Next, Sara took ten to fifteen minutes to compose a to-do list for the day ahead in the personal organizer that we persuaded her to purchase. Sara had always resisted the idea of lists, but she acknowledged that the demands in her life had exceeded her capacity to keep track of all of them. Finally, during her thirty-minute commute to work, Sara built a mental preparation ritual—thinking through the day ahead, and visualizing how she wanted to handle the specific challenges that she faced.

莎拉做出第一个改变是早上花20～30分钟将注意力从外部转移到内心，记录下工作和私人生活中出现的问题。写作让她感到自己不是一部工作机器，还留出了反思工作或生活中人际关系的空间。第二步是用10～15分钟在电子备忘录上列出今天的待办事项，她也承认，工作中常常计划赶不上变化。坐车上班的半个小时是规划时间——思考一天可能发生的事情，设想自己如何处理具体危机。

It took Sara more than a month to get these initial rituals in place, in part because she resisted at first being captive to such a fixed schedule. What she discovered over time was that the morning rituals actually gave her a greater sense of calmness and focus, which made her feel freer and less under siege. Once her morning rituals became relatively automatic, she committed to changing the way that she managed her priorities when she got to work. Her usual practice was to move immediately into reactive mode—reading the previous night’s accumulated email or answering voice mail or responding to someone at her door. Instead, she decided to devote the first sixty minutes to whatever project she had deemed most important. Sara chose 8:00 to 9:00 A.M. for this work, both because it was when she felt freshest and because the demands on her time grew as the day wore on. She told her secretary that she did not want to be interrupted during these sixty minutes except in the case of an emergency.

Sara mostly used this early morning time for writing projects, which had previously consumed her weekends. Launching her days by being productive on a project of her own choosing gave her a sense of accomplishment and an energy boost for the rest of the day. Sara also committed to taking an aerobics class at 7:00 P.M. three nights a week, which forced her to leave work, served as a source of mental and emotional recovery after demanding days, and created an effective transition between work and home.

莎拉用了一个多月适应这些新习惯，起初本能地抗拒固定安排。然而她渐渐发现，新的晨间习惯给她带来更多的镇定和专注，让她的思维更加自由，事务缠身的感觉也少了许多。当习惯变成自发反应，她顺势改变了事务处理方式。从前她习惯于直接进入应答模式——处理邮件、答复语音信息或者回复同事的问询，现在她决定将工作的前60分钟即8点到9点用于最重要的事情，一是因为这段时间里精力最旺盛，二是因为越到后面琐事越多。她告诉秘书，除非紧急情况，她不希望这60分钟被人打扰。这个小时莎拉主要用于撰写项目，之前这消耗了她的周末时间。一天伊始便能高效完成目标让莎拉充满成就感，也更有信心面对其他事务。她还报名参加了有氧运动课程，一周三次晚上上课，强迫自己离开办公室。运动对思维和情感都有绝佳的恢复效果，也帮她完成了工作到生活的过渡。

Finally, Sara became almost religious about building two breaks into her day as a means of insuring intermittent recovery. The hospital cafeteria was on another floor, and she made it her business to go there at 10:30 A.M. and then again at 3:30 P.M. for at least five to ten minutes. Events didn’t always make it possible to take breaks at exactly these times, so Sara simply took them as close to the designated times as she possibly could. Modest as the breaks were, they provided a way to escape the maelstrom for a few moments, to eat piece of fruit or drink a cup of tea, and to regroup.

最后，莎拉认为应该在工作中加入间歇休息。医院的餐厅跟她的办公室不在同一楼层，她规定自己上午10点半、下午3点半各去一次，停留5～10分钟。虽然无法每次都按时赴会，她还是尽量靠近规定的时间放松自己。即便这种休整很短暂，吃块水果、喝杯茶，也能把她拉出长时间的工作旋涡，重整旗鼓。

Failing to respond instantly to people’s requests was very difficult for Sara at first. By the second month, however, the increased freedom, clarity and productivity she felt far outweighed her guilt. Because she was more focused and productive, she also found that she was more comfortable taking time with people, both about strategic issues at work, and about their personal concerns—especially at the end of the workday. To her surprise, the new structure in her life gave her a sense of freedom and relaxed energy.

莎拉起初很难做到不立刻反馈人们的要求。到了第二个月，自由、条理和高效的好处就战胜了她的负罪感。因为工作效率提高，她也有了更多时间与人相处，无论是谈论工作还是闲聊——尤其是在一天结束时，都会带来很多乐趣。让她感到惊喜的是，这种新的生活方式赋予她崭新的自由和轻松愉悦的精力。
