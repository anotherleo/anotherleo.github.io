# Rule #4: Drain the Shallows

In the summer of 2007, the software company 37signals (now called Basecamp) launched an experiment: They shortened their workweek from five days to four. Their employees seemed to accomplish the same amount of work with one less day, so they made this change permanent: Every year, from May through October, 37signals employees work only Monday to Thursday (with the exception of customer support, which still operates the full week). As company cofounder Jason Fried quipped in a blog post about the decision: “People should enjoy the weather in the summer.”

2007 年夏天，软件公司 37signals（现在叫 basecamp）做了一个实验：将每周 5 天工作制缩短成 4 天。尽管工作日少了一天，但是员工似乎还可以完成相同的工作量，于是他们的这项改革变成了永久政策：每年 5～10 月，37signals 的员工只需从周一工作到周四（售后服务除外，他们一周 7 天都要工作）。公司发起人之一贾森·弗里德（Jason Fried）在博文里风趣地说道：“在夏季，人们应该享受美好的天气。”

It didn’t take long before the grumbles began in the business press. A few months after Fried announced his company’s decision to make four-day weeks permanent, journalist Tara Weiss wrote a critical piece for *Forbes* titled “Why a Four-Day Work Week Doesn’t Work.” She summarized her problem with this strategy as follows:

没多久，企业界人士就对此表示了不满。在弗里德宣布他的公司固定每周 4 天工作制的几个月后，记者塔拉·维斯（Tara Weiss）在《福布斯》杂志发表了一篇名为“为什么每周 4 天工作制不行”的评论文章。她用如下的策略总结了自己的问题：

> Packing 40 hours into four days isn’t necessarily an efficient way to work. Many people find that eight hours are tough enough; requiring them to stay for an extra two could cause morale and productivity to decrease.
>
> 在 4 天内完成 40 小时的工作量并不见得是一种有效的工作方法。许多人觉得 8 个小时已经够煎熬了；让他们多工作两个小时可能导致士气和生产效率下降。

Fried was quick to respond. In a blog post titled “Forbes Misses the Point of the 4-Day Work Week,” he begins by agreeing with Weiss’s premise that it *would* be stressful for employees to cram forty hours of effort into four days. But, as he clarifies, that’s not what he’s suggesting. “The point of the 4-day work week is about *doing less work*,” he writes. “It’s not about four 10-hour days… it’s about four normalish 8-hour days.”

弗里德迅速回应。在一篇名为“《福布斯》忽视了每周 4 天工作制的意义”的博文中，他首先对维斯的假设表示了赞同，4 天完成 40 小时的工作对于员工来说是十分有压力的。但是他解释道，这不是他所建议的工作方式。“一周 4 天工作制的意义在于做更少的工作。”他写道，“不是一天 10 小时的工作……是正常的一天 8 小时。”

This might seem confusing at first. Fried earlier claimed that his employees get just as much done in four days as in five days. Now, however, he’s claiming that his employees are working fewer hours. How can both be true? The difference, it turns out, concerns the role of shallow work. As Fried expands:

这一开始可能令人疑惑。弗里德早先说过他的员工在 4 天的时间里完成的工作量与 5 天的一样多。然而现在他却说员工工作的时间减少了。这两件事怎么可能同时为真呢？原来这种不同在于浮浅工作。弗里德说：

> Very few people work even 8 hours a day. You’re lucky if you get a few good hours in between all the meetings, interruptions, web surfing, office politics, and personal business that permeate the typical workday.
>
> 很少有人能做到一天工作 8 个小时。在充斥着各种会议、干扰、网页浏览、办公室政治和私人事务的一个普通工作日里，能够专心工作几个小时就已经很幸运了。
>
> Fewer official working hours helps squeeze the fat out of the typical workweek. Once everyone has less time to get their stuff done, they respect that time even more. People become stingy with their time and that’s a good thing. They don’t waste it on things that just don’t matter. When you have fewer hours you usually spend them more wisely.
>
> 更少的正式工作时间有助于挤压出更高的效率。如果每个人都只有更少的时间完成任务，他们就会更加尊重时间。人会变得珍惜时间，而这是一件很好的事情。他们不会把时间花在无关紧要的事情上。如果拥有的时间变少，你就会更聪明地利用时间。

In other words, the reduction in the 37signals workweek disproportionately eliminated shallow as compared to deep work, and because the latter was left largely untouched, the important stuff continued to get done. The shallow stuff that can seem so urgent in the moment turned out to be unexpectedly dispensable.

换句话说，37signals 工作时间的减少主要是集中在浮浅工作而不是深度工作。因为深度工作几乎没有减少，所以重要的事情仍能完成。结果证明那些原来看似十分紧急的浮浅工作其实是无关紧要的。

A natural reaction to this experiment is to wonder what would happen if 37signals had gone one step further. If eliminating hours of shallow work had little impact on the results produced, what would happen if they not only eliminated shallow work, but then replaced this newly recovered time with more deep work? Fortunately for our curiosity, the company soon put this bolder idea to the test as well.

对该实验的一个很自然的反应就是如果 37signals 的实验更进一步将会发生什么。如果减掉浮浅工作的时间对于工作成果几乎没有影响，那么如果他们不仅仅是减掉浮浅工作，而是进一步用余下的时间进行深度工作，将会发生什么。所幸，这家公司不久之后就将这个更大胆的疑问付诸实践。

Fried had always been interested in the policies of technology companies like Google that gave their employees 20 percent of their time to work on self-directed projects. While he liked this idea, he felt that carving one day out of an otherwise busy week was not enough to support the type of unbroken deep work that generates true breakthroughs. “I’d take 5 days in a row over 5 days spread out over 5 weeks,” he explained. “So our theory is that we’ll see better results when people have a long stretch of uninterrupted time.”

谷歌允许员工拿出 20% 的时间用于自己主导的项目，弗里德一直对这个政策很感兴趣。尽管他喜欢这个主意，但是他感觉从每一个忙碌的一周中都抽出一天，不利于产生真正突破的连续深度工作。“对于从 5 周中拿出 5 天，我更倾向于集中拿出 5 天，”他解释道，“我们的理论是，人们通过长时间不被打断的工作可以创造更好的成果。”

To test this theory, 37signals implemented something radical: The company gave its employees the *entire month of June* off to work deeply on their own projects. This month would be a period free of any shallow work obligations—no status meetings, no memos, and, blessedly, no PowerPoint. At the end of the month, the company held a “pitch day” in which employees pitched the ideas they’d been working on. Summarizing the experiment in an *Inc.* magazine article, Fried dubbed it a success. The pitch day produced two projects that were soon put into production: a better suite of tools for handling customer support and a data visualization system that helps the company understand how their customers use their products. These projects are predicted to bring substantial value to the company, but they almost certainly would *not* have been produced in the absence of the unobstructed deep work time provided to the employees. To tease out their potential required dozens of hours of unimpeded effort.

为了测试这个理论，37signals 执行了一些激进的措施：整个 6 月，公司让员工去在自己的项目上深度工作。这一个月可以免去所有浮浅的工作责任——没有状态审查会，没有备忘录，公司组织了一个“路演日”，员工可以展示他们正在研究的想法。在 Inc.杂志文章中，弗里德总结了这个实验，并称实验是成功的。路演日产生了两个迅速投入生产的项目：一个是能更好处理售后服务的工具套装，另一个是一套可以帮助公司更好掌握客户是如何使用本公司产品的数据可视化系统。这些项目将为公司带来可观的利润，但是如果没有提供给员工的那些不受打扰的深度工作时间，这些项目极有可能不会被出现。梳理出它们的潜在可能性需要几十个小时的不懈努力。

“How can we afford to put our business on hold for a month to ‘mess around’ with new ideas?” Fried asked rhetorically. “How can we afford not to?”

“我们公司怎么能把业务暂停一个月去‘捣鼓’新主意呢？”弗里德讲究了一下修辞，“我们怎么能不呢？”

37signals’ experiments highlight an important reality: The shallow work that increasingly dominates the time and attention of knowledge workers is less vital than it often seems in the moment. For most businesses, if you eliminated significant amounts of this shallowness, their bottom line would likely remain unaffected. And as Jason Fried discovered, if you not only eliminate shallow work, but also replace this recovered time with more of the deep alternative, not only will the business continue to function; it can become *more* successful.

37signals 的实验说明了一个很重要的现实：越来越多的占用知识工作者时间和注意力的浮浅工作往往不似原本看来那么重要。对于大多数公务来说，如果你减少大量此类浮浅的工作，公务的底线目标也不会受影响。正如贾森·弗里德所发现的，如果你不仅仅终止浮浅工作，并且把从中夺回的时间投入到更多的深度工作中，你的事业将不仅能正常开展，而且会取得更大的成功。

This rule asks you to apply these insights to your personal work life. The strategies that follow are designed to help you ruthlessly identify the shallowness in your current schedule, then cull it down to minimum levels—leaving more time for the deep efforts that ultimately matter most.

该准则要求你把这些见解运用到个人的工作中。以下的策略旨在帮助你客观地认识当前个人日程中的浮浅内容，然后将其降到最低程度，以节省更多的时间用于极端重要的工作上。

Before diving into the details of these strategies, however, we should first confront the reality that there’s a limit to this anti-shallow thinking. The value of deep work vastly outweighs the value of shallow, but this doesn’t mean that you must quixotically pursue a schedule in which *all* of your time is invested in depth. For one thing, a nontrivial amount of shallow work is needed to maintain most knowledge work jobs. You might be able to avoid checking your e-mail every ten minutes, but you won’t likely last long if you *never* respond to important messages. In this sense, we should see the goal of this rule as taming shallow work’s footprint in your schedule, not eliminating it.

在讨论这些策略的细节之前，我们应该先意识到这样一个现实：这种反对浮浅的思维是有其局限的。虽然深度工作的价值远远超过了浮浅工作，但这并不意味着你必须像堂吉诃德一样试图把你所有的时间都投入到深度工作中。其中一个方面是，一定量的浮浅工作在大多数知识工作中是必要的。你应该可以避免每 10 分钟检查一次自己的电子邮件，但是不可能永远不回复重要的信息。从这个意义讲，我们应该明白该准则的目标是减少浮浅工作在我们日程中的分量，而不是将其消除。

Then there’s the issue of cognitive capacity. Deep work is exhausting because it pushes you toward the limit of your abilities. Performance psychologists have extensively studied how much such efforts can be sustained by an individual in a given day. In their seminal paper on deliberate practice, Anders Ericsson and his collaborators survey these studies. They note that for someone new to such practice (citing, in particular, a child in the early stages of developing an expert-level skill), an hour a day is a reasonable limit. For those familiar with the rigors of such activities, the limit expands to something like four hours, but rarely more.

然后还有一个就是认知能力的问题。深度工作十分耗神，会将一个人推向能力的极限。行为心理学家曾深入研究过，在给定的一天时间内，一个人可以保持多长时间的深度工作。安纳斯·特立信（Aners Tricsson）及他的同事在关于主动实践的重要论文中就此做了研究。他们发现对于此类实践的新手（特别引用了一个刚开始培养专家级技能的孩子的例子），一天一小时是一个合理的上限。对于熟悉此类活动严酷性的人来说，上限可以达到 4 个小时，但是很少能持续更久。

The implication is that once you’ve hit your deep work limit in a given day, you’ll experience diminishing rewards if you try to cram in more. Shallow work, therefore, doesn’t become dangerous until after you add enough to begin to crowd out your bounded deep efforts for the day. At first, this caveat might seem optimistic. The typical workday is eight hours. The most adept deep thinker cannot spend more than four of these hours in a state of true depth. It follows that you can safely spend half the day wallowing in the shallows without adverse effect. The danger missed by this analysis is how *easily* this amount of time can be consumed, especially once you consider the impact of meetings, appointments, calls, and other scheduled events. For many jobs, these time drains can leave you with surprisingly little time left for solo work.

这意味着一旦你在一天中达到了深度工作的上限后，继续试图增加深度工作效果就会下降。因此，浮浅工作并不可怕，只有其比例增加太多影响到你当天的深度工作上限时才需要注意。乍一看，这个警示或许没有那么可怕。通常一个工作日 8 个小时。这 8 小时内，没有一个熟练的深度工作者可以保持超过 4 个小时的深度状态。这样的结果就是一天中你可以有半天做浮浅工作，而且不会有害处。可是你可能没有意识到这些时间其实很容易被占用，尤其要考虑那些会议、预约、电话和其他计划内事务。在很多工作中，这些时间终结者将导致你每天只有很少的时间可以单独工作。

My job as a professor, for example, is traditionally less plagued by such commitments, but even so, they often take large chunks out of my time, especially during the academic year. Turning to a random day in my calendar from the previous semester (I’m writing this during a quiet summer month), for example, I see I had a meeting from eleven to twelve, another from one to two thirty, and a class to teach from three to five. My eight-hour workday in this example is already reduced by four hours. Even if I squeezed all remaining shallow work (e-mails, tasks) into a single half hour, I’d still fall short of the goal of four hours of daily deep work. Put another way, even though we’re not capable of spending a full day in a state of blissful depth, this reality shouldn’t reduce the urgency of reducing shallow work, as the typical knowledge workday is more easily fragmented than many suspect.

以我个人为例，我是一名教授，按惯例这份工作应该很少受这些任务的搅扰，但即使是教授这样的职务，此类任务也经常占去我大块的时间，尤其是在学期内。在我的日程表上随便一个学期的某一天（写到此时，正值宁静的夏日），我看到从 11 点到 12 点、从 1 点到 2 点半我参加了两个会议，从 3 点到 5 点教了一节课。在这个例子中，我一天的 8 小时只剩下 4 个小时。即使我把所有其他的浮浅工作（电子邮件、任务）压缩在半小时完成，也不能达到一天 4 个小时深度工作的目标。换言之，虽然我们不能一整天都做到令人喜悦的深度工作，但减少浮浅工作的任务还是十分紧迫的，尤其是要考虑到通常知识工作的一天更容易受干扰而变得支离破碎。

To summarize, I’m asking you to treat shallow work with suspicion because its damage is often vastly underestimated and its importance vastly overestimated. This type of work is inevitable, but you must keep it confined to a point where it doesn’t impede your ability to take full advantage of the deeper efforts that ultimately determine your impact. The strategies that follow will help you act on this reality.

总而言之，希望你能用怀疑的眼光对待浮浅工作，因为其害处经常被低估，而作用却经常被高估。这种工作不可避免，但是你必须对其加以限制，使其不影响你充分深度工作的能力，因为深度工作决定着你的最终工作成效。接下来的策略将助力你的实践活动。

## Schedule Every Minute of Your Day

If you’re between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-four years old and live in Britain, you likely watch more television than you realize. In 2013, the British TV licensing authority surveyed television watchers about their habits. The twenty-five-to thirty-four-year-olds taking the survey estimated that they spend somewhere between fifteen and sixteen hours per week watching TV. This sounds like a lot, but it’s actually a significant underestimate. We know this because when it comes to television-watching habits, we have access to the ground truth. The Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board (the British equivalent of the American Nielsen Company) places meters in a representative sample of households. These meters record, without bias or wishful thinking, exactly how much people *actually* watch. The twenty-five-to thirty-four-year-olds who thought they watched fifteen hours a week, it turns out, watch more like twenty-eight hours.

如果你现在年纪在 25～34 岁之间，居住在大不列颠，那很可能会在不知不觉中花上很多时间看电视。2013 年，英国电视证照管理局调查了电视观众的习惯。25～34 岁的受访者估测一周大约有 15～16 小时用于看电视。这个数字听起来已经够多了，但实际上这个数字是被严重低估的。我们敢这样说，是因为在电视观看习惯上，我们可以拿到最真实的资料。广播公司观众调查委员会（这个相当于美国的尼尔森市场调查公司）在一个有代表性的家庭样本中安装了计量装置。这些计量装置客观地记录下人们观看电视的时间到底有多长。25～34 岁的人群实际观看电视的时间多于 28 小时，而不是 15 小时。

This bad estimate of time usage is not unique to British television watching. When you consider different groups self-estimating different behaviors, similar gaps stubbornly remain. In a *Wall Street Journal* article on the topic, business writer Laura Vanderkam pointed out several more such examples. A survey by the National Sleep Foundation revealed that Americans think they’re sleeping, on average, somewhere around seven hours a night. The American Time Use Survey, which has people actually measure their sleep, corrected this number to 8.6 hours. Another study found that people who claimed to work sixty to sixty-four hours per week were actually averaging more like forty-four hours per week, while those claiming to work more than seventy-five hours were actually working less than fifty-five.

这种关于使用时间的错误统计并不单单存在于英国的电视观众中。不同群体计算自己进行不同行为的时间时，会存在相同的谬误。在一篇刊登于《华尔街日报》的同主题文章中，商业作家劳拉·范·卡姆（Laura Vanderkam）介绍了更多的此类案例。根据国家睡眠基金会的调查，美国人自行估计平均每晚睡眠时间为 7 个小时。美国时间利用调查组织通过调研显示，每人的实际平均睡眠时间应该为 8.6 小时。另一项调查发现，那些宣称自己平均一周工作 60～64 小时的人实际上平均每周大约只工作了 44 小时，那些宣称自己一周工作 75 个小时的人实际上只工作了 55 个小时。

These examples underscore an important point: We spend much of our day on autopilot—not giving much thought to what we’re doing with our time. *This is a problem*. It’s difficult to prevent the trivial from creeping into every corner of your schedule if you don’t face, without flinching, your current balance between deep and shallow work, and then adopt the habit of pausing before action and asking, “What makes the most sense right now?” The strategy described in the following paragraphs is designed to force you into these behaviors. It’s an idea that might seem extreme at first but will soon prove indispensable in your quest to take full advantage of the value of deep work: *Schedule every minute of your day*.

这些例子都表明了一点：我们一天中的大多数时间是在浑浑噩噩中度过的，对于应该如何安排时间并没有考虑太多。这是一个问题。如果不果敢地调整深度工作与浮浅工作的关系，不在行动前暂停一下问问自己“现在去做什么是最有意义的”，你将很难避免被烦琐杂事占满日程。接下来的几个段落将会介绍一些促使你这样做的策略。这些观点乍一看显得极端，但是很快你就会发现要充分享用深度工作的好处，就需要一天中的每一分钟都要做好计划。

Here’s my suggestion: At the beginning of each workday, turn to a new page of lined paper in a notebook you dedicate to this purpose. Down the left-hand side of the page, mark every other line with an hour of the day, covering the full set of hours you typically work. Now comes the important part: Divide the hours of your workday into *blocks* and assign activities to the blocks. For example, you might block off nine a.m. to eleven a.m. for writing a client’s press release. To do so, actually draw a box that covers the lines corresponding to these hours, then write “press release” inside the box. Not every block need be dedicated to a work task. There might be time blocks for lunch or relaxation breaks. To keep things reasonably clean, the minimum length of a block should be thirty minutes (i.e., one line on your page). This means, for example, that instead of having a unique small box for each small task on your plate for the day—*respond to boss’s e-mail, submit reimbursement form, ask Carl about report*—you can batch similar things into more generic *task blocks*. You might find it useful, in this case, to draw a line from a task block to the open right-hand side of the page where you can list out the full set of small tasks you plan to accomplish in that block.

我建议：为本策略专门准备一个笔记本，在每个工作日开始的时候翻开新的一页。在页面的左侧，每隔一行写下这一天的每一个小时，包括普通工作日的全部时间。接下来是最重要的一个环节：将工作日的每一天划成方格，把活动放在这些空格中。例如，你可以把上午 9～11 点安排成为客户写新闻宣传稿的时段。你只需围着相应的那几行画一个框，框住那几个小时，然后在框内写“新闻宣传稿”。并不是每一个方格都要安排活动。你也可以安排一些午饭或者是休息的方格。简便起见，每一个方格的最短时长为半小时（也就是页面上的一行）。举个例子，这就意味着你并不需要为一天的每一个小活动（比如回老板的电子邮件、提交退款单、问卡尔报告的情况）安排版面，你可以把这些活动按批次放在一个更通用的任务方格里。针对这种情况，你可以从任务方格引出一条线，引到页面的右手边，在右手边你可以有充足的空间列出需要完成的每一个小任务。

When you’re done scheduling your day, every minute should be part of a block. You have, in effect, given every minute of your workday a job. Now as you go through your day, use this schedule to guide you.

完成一天的工作计划之后，每一分钟都应该在某个方格里有所体现。实际上，你已经为这一天的每一分钟安排了时间。此时，请你使用这个工作计划来引导一天的工作。

It’s here, of course, that most people will begin to run into trouble. Two things can (and likely will) go wrong with your schedule once the day progresses. The first is that your estimates will prove wrong. You might put aside two hours for writing a press release, for example, and in reality it takes two and a half hours. The second problem is that you’ll be interrupted and new obligations will unexpectedly appear on your plate. These events will also break your schedule.

可以预见的是，大部分人从这一步开始就遇到了麻烦。随着一天工作的展开，关于该工作计划，有两个方面容易（并且也极为可能）出岔子。第一，你的计划可能不符合实际。例如你为写新闻通讯稿预留了两小时，但是实际上你花掉了两个半小时。第二，你可能会被打断，新的工作任务会出现到你的日程里。这些事情也会打乱你的日程。

This is okay. If your schedule is disrupted, you should, at the next available moment, take a few minutes to create a revised schedule for the time that remains in the day. You can turn to a new page. You can erase and redraw blocks. Or do as I do: Cross out the blocks for the remainder of the day and create new blocks to the right of the old ones on the page (I draw my blocks skinny so I have room for several revisions). On some days, you might rewrite your schedule half a dozen times. Don’t despair if this happens. Your goal is not to stick to a given schedule at all costs; it’s instead to maintain, at all times, a thoughtful say in what you’re doing with your time going forward—even if these decisions are reworked again and again as the day unfolds.

这些都没有问题。如果你的日程被打断，在紧接下来的空闲时间，就应该花几分钟修改一天余下时间的计划。你可以翻到新的一页，也可以擦掉原有的重新编写，还可以像我一样：划掉原有的方格，在其右方为今天剩余的时间画出新的方格（我画的格子很瘦，所以有足够的空间修改几次）。有些日子里，你可能一天要修改十多次计划。如果出现了这种情况，不要气馁。你的目标并不是竭尽全力维持既定的计划，而是在时间的推进中掌握工作的主动权，即使是在一天中，我们的决定也会一变再变。

If you find that schedule revisions become overwhelming in their frequency, there are a few tactics that can inject some more stability. First, you should recognize that *almost definitely* you’re going to underestimate at first how much time you require for most things. When people are new to this habit, they tend to use their schedule as an incarnation of wishful thinking—a best-case scenario for their day. Over time, you should make an effort to accurately (if not somewhat conservatively) predict the time tasks will require.

如果你觉得计划改变的频率高得难以接受，这里有一些可以增加稳定性的诀窍。首先，你应该承认，你对大多数事情所需要的时间是预备不足的。刚开始尝试这个习惯时，很可能会一厢情愿地制定计划——完美一天的样板。经过一段时间的练习，你应该尝试准确地（甚至有些保守地）预估完成任务所需要的时间。

The second tactic that helps is the use of *overflow conditional* blocks. If you’re not sure how long a given activity might take, block off the expected time, then follow this with an additional block that has a split purpose. If you need more time for the preceding activity, use this additional block to keep working on it. If you finish the activity on time, however, have an alternate use already assigned for the extra block (for example, some nonurgent tasks). This allows unpredictability in your day without requiring you to keep changing your schedule on paper. For example, returning to our press release example, you might schedule two hours for writing the press release, but then follow it by an additional hour block that you can use to keep writing the release, if needed, but otherwise assign to catching up with e-mail.

第二个诀窍就是使用备用方格。如果你不确定一个既定任务需要多长时间，先初步预估需要的时间，然后在下面再多安排一个方格，这个方格可以有多重作用。如果这个既定任务需要更多时间才能完成，那么就占用下边这个备用方格。但是如果你在预定的时间内完成了任务，那么就把备用的方格安排做其他的活动（比如说一些非紧急事务）。这样就可以保证在不改变日程的情况下，容许不可预知的事情发生。我们回顾一下前文用过的写新闻宣传稿的例子，你可能安排两个小时来写这个稿子，然后预留接下来的一个小时继续写，但是如果不需要额外时间，就可以去查自己的电子邮箱。

The third tactic I suggest is to be liberal with your use of task blocks. Deploy many throughout your day and make them longer than required to handle the tasks you plan in the morning. Lots of things come up during the typical knowledge worker’s day: Having regularly occurring blocks of time to address these surprises keeps things running smoothly.

我建议的第三个诀窍就是灵活使用这些任务方格。方格安排多一些，上午的方格安排的时间要比预计的多一些。在知识工作者典型的一天中，很多事情会发生：预留出时间方格来处理意外事件，会让一切更顺利。

Before leaving you to put this strategy in practice, I should address a common objection. In my experience pitching the values of daily schedules, I’ve found that many people worry that this level of planning will become burdensomely restrictive. Here, for example, is part of a comment from a reader named Joseph on a blog post I wrote on this topic:

在你实践这个策略之前，我应该在此先回应一个常见的反对意见。依我在推广这个日常计划中得到的经验，很多人会担心这种规划的要求可能十分严格，会带来麻烦。下面是我摘录的一名叫约瑟夫的读者对我发表的同主题博文的评论：

> I think you far understate the role of uncertainty… I [worry about] readers applying these observations too seriously, to the point of an obsessive (and unhealthy) relationship with one’s schedule that seems to exaggerate the importance of minute-counting over getting-lost-in-activities, which if we’re talking about artists is often the only really sensible course of action.
>
> 我认为您低估了不确定性的作用……我（担心）读者使用这些观察结果时会过于严肃，以至于过度依赖（并且导致不好的结果）。一个人制作日程计划的习惯可能会夸大计时的重要性，而忽视了沉浸于工作的重要性，而沉浸于工作才是一个活动最重要的地方。

I understand these concerns, and Joseph is certainly not the first to raise them. Fortunately, however, they’re also easily addressed. In my own daily scheduling discipline, in addition to regularly scheduling significant blocks of time for speculative thinking and discussion, I maintain a rule that if I stumble onto an important insight, then this is a perfectly valid reason to ignore the rest of my schedule for the day (with the exception, of course, of things that cannot be skipped). I can then stick with this unexpected insight until it loses steam. At this point, I’ll step back and rebuild my schedule for any time that remains in the day.

我理解这种担忧，并且约瑟夫也不是第一个提出这种观点的人。然而幸运的是，这个问题也可以轻松解决了。在我的日常安排原则里，除了经常会为探索性思考和探讨预留大块的时间格之外，还时刻保持着一项准则，即一旦有灵光乍现，有了突破性的洞见，一天的其他日程安排就都可以暂时抛到一边（当然，实在抛不到一边的也没有办法）。之后我会坚持探究这种新的洞见，直到理清其中的头绪。这之后我会抽身出来，重新安排一天余下的时间。

In other words, I not only allow spontaneity in my schedule; I encourage it. Joseph’s critique is driven by the mistaken idea that the goal of a schedule is to force your behavior into a rigid plan. This type of scheduling, however, isn’t about constraint—it’s instead about thoughtfulness. It’s a simple habit that forces you to continually take a moment throughout your day and ask: “What makes sense for me to do with the time that remains?” It’s the habit of asking that returns results, not your unyielding fidelity to the answer.

换言之，我不仅允许日程中有突发性改变，甚至会主动寻求这种改变。约瑟夫的批评是源于他对日程表的误解，他认为日程表就是强迫一个人严格按计划行事。然而我所说的日程计划的核心目的不是限制，而是强调谋划周到。在一天里时常拿出一点时间来询问自己“在今天剩下的时间里，我做什么最有道理”，是一个很简单的习惯。这是一个让你思考如何产出最大化的习惯，而不是让你对自己的答案保持不折不挠的忠贞。

I would go so far as to argue that someone following this combination of comprehensive scheduling and a willingness to adapt or modify the plan as needed will likely experience *more* creative insights than someone who adopts a more traditionally “spontaneous” approach where the day is left open and unstructured. Without structure, it’s easy to allow your time to devolve into the shallow—e-mail, social media, Web surfing. This type of shallow behavior, though satisfying in the moment, is not conducive to creativity. With structure, on the other hand, you can ensure that you regularly schedule blocks to grapple with a new idea, or work deeply on something challenging, or brainstorm for a fixed period—the type of commitment more likely to instigate innovation. (Recall, for example, the discussion in Rule #1 about the rigid rituals followed by many great creative thinkers.) And because you’re willing to abandon your plan when an innovative idea arises, you’re just as well suited as the distracted creative to follow up when the muse strikes.

我甚至要说，一个同时具有综合计划能力和修正自己计划的意愿的人，相比那些采用传统“自发性”方法、一天没有任何计划的人，将享有更多的创造性洞见。没有计划，你的时间很可能被浮浅事务占用——电子邮件、社交媒体、浏览网页。这些浮浅事务虽然在短时间内会令人愉悦，但是并不有助于培养创造力。借助计划，你可以确保经常性的安排时间来处理新主意，或者在有挑战性的领域进行深度工作，或者在一个固定时间内进行头脑风暴——这些活动更容易带来创新（例如回想一下在准则 1 中，很多著名的创意思考者所遵循的一些习惯）。因为当创新性想法出现时，你也愿意放弃原本的日程安排，所以在灵感涌现的时候，你也可以像那些纷扰中搞创新的人一样跟进。

To summarize, the motivation for this strategy is the recognition that a deep work habit requires you to treat your time with respect. A good first step toward this respectful handling is the advice outlined here: Decide in advance what you’re going to do with every minute of your workday. It’s natural, at first, to resist this idea, as it’s undoubtedly easier to continue to allow the twin forces of internal whim and external requests to drive your schedule. But you must overcome this distrust of structure if you want to approach your true potential as someone who creates things that matter.

总而言之，该策略的目的在于帮助你认识到，深度工作要求你尊重自己的时间。要做到真正尊重时间，下面这一条建议是个很不错的开端：提前决定你一天的每一分钟要做什么工作。因为一个人的日程都是由内在驱动和外在要求这两股力量决定的，所以开始的时候你对这个主意有所抵触也是自然的。但是如果你想发掘自己的潜力，成为一个有所成就的人，那就必须打破这种疑虑。

## Quantify the Depth of Every Activity

An advantage of scheduling your day is that you can determine how much time you’re actually spending in shallow activities. Extracting this insight from your schedules, however, can become tricky in practice, as it’s not always clear exactly how shallow you should consider a given task. To expand on this challenge, let’s start by reminding ourselves of the formal definition of shallow work that I introduced in the introduction:

预先计划一天的工作，好处在于可以判定有多少时间用在浮浅活动上。但是在实践中，要在日程计划中贯彻这一策略却有点棘手，因为一个既定任务是否浮浅是难以判定的。为了应对这个挑战，让我们重新回想一下在序言中提及的浮浅工作的定义：

> **Shallow Work:** Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
>
> 浮浅工作：对认知要求不高的事务性任务，通常在受到干扰的情况下开展。此类工作通常不会为世界创造太多新价值，且容易复制。

Some activities clearly satisfy this definition. Checking e-mail, for example, or scheduling a conference call, is unquestionably shallow in nature. But the classification of other activities can be more ambiguous. Consider the following tasks:

有些活动十分符合这个定义。例如查收电子邮件、安排一个电话会议，从本质上讲显然是浮浅的，但是要判定某些活动是否浮浅就不那么容易了，请考虑以下工作：

- **Example #1**: Editing a draft of an academic article that you and a collaborator will soon submit to a journal. **例1**：和搭档合作编辑将于近期提交某杂志的学术文章草稿。
- **Example #2**: Building a PowerPoint presentation about this quarter’s sales figures. **例2**：制作一个关于本季度销售量的 PPT。
- **Example #3**: Attending a meeting to discuss the current status of an important project and to agree on the next steps. **例3**：参加一个讨论某重要工程进度的会议，并就下一步方案达成一致。

It’s not obvious at first how to categorize these examples. The first two describe tasks that can be quite demanding, and the final example seems important to advance a key work objective. The purpose of this strategy is to give you an accurate metric for resolving such ambiguity—providing you with a way to make clear and consistent decisions about where given work tasks fall on the shallow-to-deep scale. To do so, it asks that you evaluate activities by asking a simple (but surprisingly illuminating) question:

刚开始的时候，这些例子之间的类别区分并不明显。前面两个例子中的任务看起来也很难。最后一个例子看起来对于推动一个重要的工程项目十分重要。这个策略的目的就是帮助你准确计量此类不确定性——为你提供一个明确而且稳定的计量表，以衡量一项给定任务的深浅度。如使用这个策略，你需要先问自己一个简单（但是很有启发性的）问题来评估这些任务：

> How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?
>
> 要让一个刚毕业还没有在该领域接受特别训练的大学生完成这项工作需要多久（几个月）？

To illustrate this approach, let’s apply this question to our examples of ambiguous tasks.

为了阐述这种方法，我们将这个问题应用于上述几个模糊的问题上。

**Analyzing Example #1**: To properly edit an academic paper requires that you understand the nuances of the work (so you can make sure it’s being described precisely) and the nuances of the broader literature (so you can make sure it’s being cited properly). These requirements require cutting-edge knowledge of an academic field—a task that in the age of specialization takes years of diligent study at the graduate level and beyond. When it comes to this example, the answer to our question would therefore be quite large, perhaps on the scale of fifty to seventy-five months.

**分析例 1**：要恰当地编写一份学术文章，你需要理解此工作的细微之处（这样你可以确定对文章的描述是准确的）和更广范围内的该领域著作（这样你可以确保文章能得到恰当地引用）。这就需要对于某一学术领域的前沿知识，而在社会高度分工的今天，这项工作需要研究生甚至更高学历的人经过数年的辛勤研究才能完成。关于这个例子，我们得出的答案可能比较长，大约在 50～75 周。

**Analyzing Example #2**: The second example doesn’t fare so well by this analysis. To create a PowerPoint presentation that describes your quarterly sales requires three things: first, knowledge of how to make a PowerPoint presentation; second, an understanding of the standard format of these quarterly performance presentations within your organization; and third, an understanding of what sales metrics your organization tracks and how to convert them into the right graphs. The hypothetical college graduate imagined by our question, we can assume, would already know how to use PowerPoint, and learning the standard format for your organization’s presentations shouldn’t require more than a week. The real question, therefore, is how long it takes a bright college graduate to understand the metrics you track, where to find the results, and how to clean those up and translate them into graphs and charts that are appropriate for a slide presentation. This isn’t a trivial task, but for a bright college grad it wouldn’t require more than an additional month or so of training—so we can use two months as our conservative answer.

**分析例 2**：对第二个例子的分析就没有那么容易了。要制作 PPT 来描述每季度的销售量需要会做三件事：第一是做 PPT 的知识，第二是对于本公司此类季度简报标准格式的掌握，第三是理解公司跟踪何种销售数据和如何将这些数据转换成正确的图表。我们假设这位大学毕业生已经掌握了制作 PPT 的技能，在此基础上学习你们公司简报的标准格式所需的时间应该不会超过一周。因此，真正的挑战在于一名聪明的大学毕业生需要多久才能理解你所跟踪的数据，在哪里找到结果，如何整理并把这些数据转换成适合幻灯片展示的图表。这不是一项简单的工作，但对于一名聪明的大学生来说，一个月的训练就足够了。所以我们保守估计例 2 所需的时间是两个月。

**Analyzing Example #3**: Meetings can be tricky to analyze. They can seem tedious at times but they’re often also presented as playing a key role in your organization’s most important activities. The method presented here helps cut through this veneer. How long would it take to train a bright recent college graduate to take your place in a planning meeting? He or she would have to understand the project well enough to know its milestones and the skills of its participants. Our hypothetical grad might also need some insight into the interpersonal dynamics and the reality of how such projects are executed at the organization. At this point, you might wonder if this college grad would also need a deep expertise in the topic tackled by the project. For a planning meeting—probably not. Such meetings rarely dive into substantive content and tend to feature a lot of small talk and posturing in which participants try to make it seem like they’re committing to a lot without actually having to commit. Give a bright recent graduate three months to learn the ropes and he or she could take your place without issue in such a gabfest. So we’ll use three months as our answer.

**分析例 3**：会议没有那么容易分析。有时候可能显得冗长，但通常又在公司的重要活动中发挥关键作用。我们的方法可以拨开这层迷雾。要训练一名聪明的大学毕业生取代你的位置来参加一次会议需要多长时间？这要求他或她很好地理解这个项目，了解项目的进度计划和与会者的能力。我们假想的这位毕业生可能也需要了解一下公司里的人际关系和如何实施这些项目的实际情况。从这一点来说，你可能也会考虑这名大学毕业生是否需要了解一些项目涉及的相关高深专业技术。对于筹备一次会议而言，应该不需要。此类会议很少深入研究实质内容，通常以小规模讨论为主，与会者毫无积极参与的意愿，只会故作姿态。让一个刚毕业的聪明大学生学三个月，取代你去参加这些冗长的会议肯定没有问题。所以我们的答案就定为三个月。

This question is meant as a thought experiment (I’m not going to ask you to actually *hire* a recent college graduate to take over tasks that score low). But the answers it provides will help you objectively quantify the shallowness or depth of various activities. If our hypothetical college graduate requires many months of training to replicate a task, then this indicates that the task leverages hard-won expertise. As argued earlier, tasks that leverage your expertise tend to be deep tasks and they can therefore provide a double benefit: They return more value per time spent, and they stretch your abilities, leading to improvement. On the other hand, a task that our hypothetical college graduate can pick up quickly is one that does not leverage expertise, and therefore it can be understood as shallow.

这个问题只是用来做思维实验（我并不会让你真的去雇佣一名刚毕业的大学生去处理那些分数低的工作）。但这些问题的结果可以帮助你客观地为各种工作的深浅度打分。如果我们假设的大学生需要花很多个月来完成一项工作，那么说明此项工作需要大量过硬的专业技能。正如前文所述，需要大量专业技能的极有可能是深度工作，因此可以提供双重的好处：可以在单位时间内提供更多的价值回报；可以锻炼你的能力，提升自我。另一方面，那些大学生能够很快上手的工作不会提高你的专业技能，因此可以理解为浮浅工作。

What should you do with this strategy? Once you know where your activities fall on the deep-to-shallow scale, bias your time toward the former. When we reconsider our case studies, for example, we see that the first task is something that you would want to prioritize as a good use of time, while the second and third are activities of a type that should be minimized—they might feel productive, but their return on (time) investment is measly.

如何利用这个策略呢？一旦明确了活动的深浅度计量表，你就把时间倾注于深度工作。在上面的三个案例研究中，你就可以将第一个任务列为利用时间的最佳工作而优先考虑，而第二个和第三个任务则属于应减少时间投入的活动——你可能认为这两项工作有意义，但是其实际回报是极少的。

Of course, how one biases away from shallow and toward depth is not always obvious—even after you know how to accurately label your commitments. This brings us to the strategies that follow, which will provide specific guidance on how to accomplish this tricky goal.

现在我们知道了怎样准确地对工作进行分类，却并不明确该怎么快速处理浮浅工作从而投身于深度工作。这就引出了下面这个策略，可以具体引导我们完成这项艰难的工作。

## Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget

Here’s an important question that’s rarely asked: *What percentage of my time should be spent on shallow work?* This strategy suggests that you ask it. If you have a boss, in other words, have a conversation about this question. (You’ll probably have to first define for him or her what “shallow” and “deep” work means.) If you work for yourself, ask *yourself* this question. In both cases, settle on a specific answer. Then—and this is the important part—try to stick to this budget. (The strategies that precede and follow this one will help you achieve this goal.)

有一个很重要的问题很少被问及：你的时间应该有几成被投入到浮浅工作中？这个策略建议你问一下这个问题。也就是说，如果你有老板的话，应该和他谈谈这个问题（或许你应该先向他们介绍“深度工作”和“浮浅工作”的定义）。如果你是自己当老板，问自己这个问题。两种情况下，都力争得到一个答案。然后——这是重要的一环，试着控制在这个预算范围内。（在本策略前后的策略将帮助你实现这个目标。）

For most people in most non-entry-level knowledge work jobs, the answer to the question will be somewhere in the 30 to 50 percent range (there’s a psychological distaste surrounding the idea of spending the *majority* of your time on unskilled tasks, so 50 percent is a natural upper limit, while at the same time most bosses will begin to worry that if this percentage gets too much lower than 30 percent you’ll be reduced to a knowledge work hermit who thinks big thoughts but never responds to e-mails).

对于大多数非入门级知识工作岗位上的大部分人来说，这个答案通常在 30%～50% 之间（由于人类对于花大部分时间做简单工作有一种天然的厌恶，所以 50% 是一个天然上限。同时，如果这个时间降到 30% 以下，那么大多数老板可能会担心你变成知识工作的隐士，花大部分时间进行宏观思考却不回复邮件）。

Obeying this budget will likely require changes to your behavior. You’ll almost certainly end up forced into saying no to projects that seem infused with shallowness while also more aggressively reducing the amount of shallowness in your existing projects. This budget might lead you to drop the need for a weekly status meeting in preference for results-driven reporting (“let me know when you’ve made significant progress; then we’ll talk”). It might also lead you to start spending more mornings in communication isolation or decide it’s not as important as you once thought to respond quickly and in detail to every cc’d e-mail that crosses your inbox.

想要控制在这个预算范围内，可能需要你改变自己的行为。你很有可能会被迫对那些看起来全是浮浅工作的项目说不，并更积极主动地减少当前项目中的浮浅工作量。这个预算可能会指引你抛弃每周一次的情况通报会，而选择结果导向的汇报（“等有重大进展再通知我，那时我们再谈”）。这个预算也可能会指引你在更多的早晨选择屏蔽通讯，再也不会认为及时、详细地回复每一封抄送到你邮箱的电子邮件是那么重要了。

These changes are all positive for your quest to make deep work central to your working life. On the one hand, they don’t ask you to abandon your core shallow obligations—a move that would cause problems and resentment—as you’re still spending a lot of time on such efforts. On the other hand, they do force you to place a hard limit on the amount of less urgent obligations you allow to slip insidiously into your schedule. This limit frees up space for significant amounts of deep effort on a consistent basis.

这些都是深度工作带来的积极改变。一方面，这并非让你放弃主要的浮浅工作任务，因为你现在仍然要在此类工作上用去很多时间，放弃浮浅工作将会带来麻烦和怨恨。另一方面，这种改变也会迫使你对那些没那么紧要的任务设定严格的上限，防止它们偷偷侵入到你的日程计划里。有了这种限制，你就能有足够的连续时间做深度工作的努力。

The reason why these decisions should start with a conversation with your boss is that this agreement establishes implicit support from your workplace. If you work for someone else, this strategy provides cover when you turn down an obligation or restructure a project to minimize shallowness. You can justify the move because it’s necessary for you to hit your prescribed target mix of work types. As I discussed in Chapter 2, part of the reason shallow work persists in large quantities in knowledge work is that we rarely see the total impact of such efforts on our schedules. We instead tend to evaluate these behaviors one by one in the moment—a perspective from which each task can seem quite reasonable and convenient. The tools from earlier in this rule, however, allow you to make this impact explicit. You can now confidently say to your boss, “This is the exact percentage of my time spent last week on shallow work,” and force him or her to give explicit approval for that ratio. Faced with these numbers, and the economic reality they clarify (it’s incredibly wasteful, for example, to pay a highly trained professional to send e-mail messages and attend meetings for thirty hours a week), a boss will be led to the natural conclusion that you *need* to say no to some things and to streamline others—even if this makes life less convenient for the boss, or for you, or for your coworkers. Because, of course, in the end, a business’s goal is to generate value, not to make sure its employees’ lives are as easy as possible.

之所以在做这些决定前需要同老板交谈，是因为这样做需要办公环境的配合。如果你是为别人工作，当你拒绝了某项任务或为了减少浮浅工作量而重新安排某项项目工作时，这个策略可以帮助你找到掩护。你可以说这么做是为了实现预设的工作安排，以此为自己的行为辩护。正如我在第二章中所说的，我们允许浮浅工作大量存在的原因中有一项是没有意识到这些工作给日程计划带来的整体影响。我们往往会局限于当时当地，一件一件地分析这些行为——从这种视角看，每一项任务似乎都很合情合理。然而，本书之前提供的工具可以使你明确此类任务的影响。现在你可以自信地对老板说：“这正是我上周在浮浅工作上的时间占比，”然后迫使他或她明确同意你给出的比例。在数据及其阐释的经济现实面前（比如说，让一位受过高等训练的专业人士回复电子邮件、一周参加 30 个小时的会议，是不可思议的浪费），老板自然会得出这样的结论：你需要拒绝一些事情，简化一些事情，即使这会使得你老板或同事的生活舒适度降低。因为一项生意的最终目的还是产出价值，而不是确保员工的生活尽可能简单。

If you work for yourself, this exercise will force you to confront the reality of how little time in your “busy” schedule you’re actually producing value. These hard numbers will provide you the confidence needed to start scaling back on the shallow activities that are sapping your time. Without these numbers, it’s difficult for an entrepreneur to say no to any opportunity that *might* generate some positive return. “I have to be on Twitter!,” “I have to maintain an active Facebook presence!,” “I have to tweak the widgets on my blog!,” you tell yourself, because when considered in isolation, to say no to any one of these activities seems like you’re being lazy. By instead picking and sticking with a shallow-to-deep ratio, you can replace this guilt-driven unconditional acceptance with the more healthy habit of trying to get the most out of the time you put aside for shallow work (therefore still exposing yourself to many opportunities), but keeping these efforts constrained to a small enough fraction of your time and attention to enable the deep work that ultimately drives your business forward.

如果你自己做老板，这项练习将使你正视现实：你“繁忙”的日程中只有很少一部分时间是真正产出价值的。这些残酷的数据将激发你的信心，减少那些偷走时间的浮浅活动。没有这些数据，一位企业家将很难拒绝任何可能产生某种积极回报的机会。“我要上推特！”“我要保持在脸谱网上的活跃度！”“我得优化博客上的小工具栏！”因为独处的时候，拒绝这些活动可能会显得你很懒。通过学习并坚持这种深浅度的分配比例，你可以摆脱因羞耻感而带来的无条件接受，转而坚持更健康的习惯，把本来留给浮浅工作的时间节省下来以发挥其最大效用（这样你仍然面临很多机遇），把浮浅工作占用的时间和精力限制得足够小，从保证你的深度工作推动事业进步。

Of course, there’s always the possibility that when you ask this question the answer is stark. No boss will explicitly answer, “One hundred percent of your time should be shallow!” (unless you’re entry level, at which point you need to delay this exercise until you’ve built enough skills to add deep efforts to your official work responsibilities), but a boss might reply, in so many words, “as much shallow work as is needed for you to promptly do whatever we need from you at the moment.” In this case, the answer is still useful, as it tells you that this isn’t a job that supports deep work, and a job that doesn’t support deep work is not a job that can help you succeed in our current information economy. You should, in this case, thank the boss for the feedback, and then promptly start planning how you can transition into a new position that values depth.

当然，你问这些问题之后得到的答案可能会显得刻板。没有老板会明确说：“你百分百的时间都应该是浮浅的！”（除非是你刚入行，需要付出足够的努力才可能有足够的技能来履行正式的工作职责），但是老板可能会直截了当地说：“当前，你应当马上做任何我们需要你马上做的浮浅工作。”这样的回答也是有用的，可以使你明白这份工作并不需要深度工作。一份不需要深度工作的工作不可能使你在当前的知识经济时代取得成功。在这种情况下，你应该感谢老板的反馈，然后迅速谋划如何转型到一个重视深度的新岗位。

## Finish Your Work by Five Thirty

In the seven days preceding my first writing these words, I participated in sixty-five different e-mail conversations. Among these sixty-five conversations, I sent exactly five e-mails after five thirty p.m. The immediate story told by these statistics is that, with few exceptions, I don’t send e-mails after five thirty. But given how intertwined e-mail has become with work in general, there’s a more surprising reality hinted by this behavior: I don’t *work* after five thirty p.m.

在我写这段话前的连续 7 天，我进行了 65 个不同的电子邮件对话。在这 65 组对话中，我在 5 点半后只发送了 5 封电子邮件。上例中的这些数据直接说明了一个事实：除极个别例外，我不在 5 点半后发电子邮件。总体来说，电子邮件和我们的工作是紧密相连的，所以这个事例告诉我们一个更令人吃惊的现实：我不在 5 点半后工作。

I call this commitment *fixed-schedule productivity*, as I fix the firm goal of not working past a certain time, then work backward to find productivity strategies that allow me to satisfy this declaration. I’ve practiced fixed-schedule productivity happily for more than half a decade now, and it’s been crucial to my efforts to build a productive professional life centered on deep work. In the pages ahead, I will try to convince you to adopt this strategy as well.

我把这种坚持叫作固定日程生产力。因为我确定了一个坚定的目标，在某个固定时间后不再工作，然后在工作中寻找提高产出的策略以达成目标。我现在快乐地实行固定日程生产力已经有 6 年了，专注于有生产效率的深度工作，是我职业生活中个人努力的重要部分。通过下文的介绍，我将努力说服你也采用这一个策略。

Let me start my pitch for fixed-schedule productivity by first noting that, according to conventional wisdom, in the academic world I inhabit this tactic should fail. Professors—especially junior professors—are notorious for adopting grueling schedules that extend into the night and through weekends. Consider, for example, a blog post published by a young computer science professor whom I’ll call “Tom.” In this post, which Tom wrote in the winter of 2014, he replicates his schedule for a recent day in which he spent twelve hours at his office. This schedule includes five different meetings and three hours of “administrative” tasks, which he describes as “tending to bushels of e-mails, filling out bureaucratic forms, organizing meeting notes, planning future meetings.” By his estimation, he spent only *one and a half* out of the twelve total hours sitting in his office tackling “real” work, which he defines as efforts that make progress toward a “research deliverable.” It’s no wonder that Tom feels coerced into working well beyond the standard workday. “I’ve already accepted the reality that I’ll be working on weekends,” he concludes in another post. “Very few junior faculty can avoid such a fate.”

在展示我的固定日程生产力之前，请允许我先做说明，按照传统智慧，我所在的学术圈里，这种策略应该是失败的。教授——尤其是新晋升教授——的日程安排应该是没日没夜、没有周末的苦行僧般的生活。举个例子，我们来探讨一位年轻计算机科学教授的一篇博文，姑且称该教授为“汤姆”。汤姆写于 2014 年冬天的这篇博文中，粘贴了当时某一天在办公室待了 12 个小时的日程表。日程表包括了 5 个不同的会议和 3 个小时的“行政事务”。他说行政事务包括“处理海量的电子邮件、填写烦琐的表格、编辑会议纪要、谋划未来会议”。根据他本人的统计，12 个小时中，只有一个半小时是在进行“真正的”工作，也就是他所定义的可以使自己向着“拿得出手的研究”进步的工作。难怪汤姆会被逼着在正常工作日之外工作。“我已经接受了在周末工作的现实，”他在另一篇博文里总结，“没有几个年轻老师可以避免这种命运。”

And yet, *I have*. Even though I don’t work at night and rarely work on weekends, between arriving at Georgetown in the fall of 2011 and beginning work on this chapter in the fall of 2014, I’ve published somewhere around twenty peer-reviewed articles. I also won two competitive grants, published one (nonacademic) book, and have almost finished writing another (which you’re reading at the moment). All while avoiding the grueling schedules deemed necessary by the Toms of the world.

虽然我晚上不工作，周末偶尔工作，但是在 2011 年秋天抵达乔治城和 2014 年秋天开始写作本书之间的这段时间里，我已经发表了大约 20 篇专业论文。此外我还赢得了两个竞争激烈的奖项，出版了一本（非学术）书，并且将要写完另一本（也就是当前这本）。所有这些成果都因躲过了那些令人疲惫不堪的日程安排——全世界的“汤姆”认为是必需的那种日程。

What explains this paradox? We can find a compelling answer in a widely disseminated article published in 2013 by an academic further along in her career, and far more accomplished than I: Radhika Nagpal, the Fred Kavli Professor of Computer Science at Harvard University. Nagpal opens the article by claiming that much of the stress suffered by tenure-track professors is self-imposed. “Scary myths and scary data abound about life as a tenure-track faculty at an ‘R1’ [research-focused] university,” she begins, before continuing to explain how she finally decided to disregard the conventional wisdom and instead “deliberately… do specific things to preserve my happiness.” This deliberate effort led Nagpal to enjoy her pre-tenure time “tremendously.”

如何解释这个矛盾？我们可以从一篇 2013 年广泛传播的文章中找到很有说服力的答案。该文章的作者拉蒂卡·纳帕尔（Radhika Nagpal）是斯坦佛大学的计算机科学教授，弗雷德·卡夫利奖获得者，她在自己的专业领域比我走得更远，成就比我更高。纳帕尔在开篇说终身教授所承受的压力大部分是自我施加的：“可怕的数学和可怕的数据包围着 R1 大学（研究型大学）的终身教员。”接着她又解释了自己是如何决定抛弃传统智慧转而坚持“刻意……做一些能够保持幸福感的事情”。这种努力使纳帕尔“极大地”享受了获得终身教职之前的生活。

Nagpal goes on to detail several examples of these efforts, but there’s one tactic in particular that should sound familiar. As Nagpal admits, early in her academic career she found herself trying to cram work into every free hour between seven a.m. and midnight (because she has kids, this time, especially in the evening, was often severely fractured). It didn’t take long before she decided this strategy was unsustainable, so she set a limit of fifty hours a week and worked backward to determine what rules and habits were needed to satisfy this constraint. Nagpal, in other words, deployed fixed-schedule productivity.

纳帕尔用几个例子详述了这些努力，其中一种策略听起来十分耳熟。纳帕尔说，在她学术生涯初期，发现自己试图把早 7 点到深夜的每一点空闲时间都塞满工作（因为她有孩子，那段时间——尤其是晚上——变得支离破碎）。没多久她就发现这种策略没有可持续性，于是给自己设定了每周 50 个小时的工作时间上限，然后再来看有哪些规则和习惯可以帮助她完成这个目标。换句话来说，纳帕尔实行了固定日程生产力。

We know this strategy didn’t hurt her academic career, as she ended up earning tenure on schedule and then jumping to the full professor level after only three additional years (an impressive ascent). How did she pull this off? According to her article, one of the main techniques for respecting her hour limit was to set drastic quotas on the major sources of *shallow* endeavors in her academic life. For example, she decided she would travel only five times per year for any purpose, as trips can generate a surprisingly large load of urgent shallow obligations (from making lodging arrangements to writing talks). Five trips a year may still sound like a lot, but for an academic it’s light. To emphasize this point, note that Matt Welsh, a former colleague of Nagpal in the Harvard computer science department (he now works for Google) once wrote a blog post in which he claimed it was typical for junior faculty to travel twelve to twenty-four times a year. (Imagine the shallow efforts Nagpal avoided in sidestepping an extra ten to fifteen trips!) The travel quota is just one of several tactics that Nagpal used to control her workday (she also, for example, placed limits on the number of papers she would review per year), but what all her tactics shared was a commitment to ruthlessly capping the shallow while protecting the deep efforts—that is, original research—that ultimately determined her professional fate.

我们知道这种策略没有影响到她的学术生涯，她按部就班地拿到了终身教职，三年后又成了正教授（非常了不起的飞跃）。她是如何实现这个目标的？在她的文章中写道，遵循时间上限的技巧中有一点在于为学术生活中的浮浅行为设立严格的配额。例如，她为自己每年设立了最多出差 5 次的上限，不论何种目的，因为出差会制造数不清的紧急浮浅任务（从编写行程到写谈话参考）。一年 5 次旅行其实也不算少，但是对于一位学者而言也不算多。举例说明，纳帕尔在哈佛计算机科学系的前同事（现在谷歌任职）马特·维尔士（Matt Welsh），曾经在一篇博文中写到，对于一名初级教员来说一年出差 12～24 次是很正常的。（可以想象，纳帕尔通过回避 10～15 次出差安排可以减少多少浮浅工作！）出差配额只是纳帕尔用来控制工作日的手段之一（例如，她还设定了每年阅读论文数量的上限），但是她所分享的所有技巧其实都集中于如何果决地减少浮浅工作和保护深度工作，即独创性的研究，这才是决定她职业命运的关键。

Returning to my own example, it’s a similar commitment that enables me to succeed with fixed scheduling. I, too, am incredibly cautious about my use of the most dangerous word in one’s productivity vocabulary: “yes.” It takes a lot to convince me to agree to something that yields shallow work. If you ask for my involvement in university business that’s not absolutely necessary, I might respond with a defense I learned from the department chair who hired me: “Talk to me after tenure.” Another tactic that works well for me is to be clear in my refusal but ambiguous in my explanation for the refusal. The key is to avoid providing enough specificity about the excuse that the requester has the opportunity to defuse it. If, for example, I turn down a time-consuming speaking invitation with the excuse that I have other trips scheduled for around the same time, I don’t provide details—which might leave the requester the ability to suggest a way to fit his or her event into my existing obligations—but instead just say, “Sounds interesting, but I can’t make it due to schedule conflicts.” In turning down obligations, I also resist the urge to offer a consolation prize that ends up devouring almost as much of my schedule (e.g., “Sorry I can’t join your committee, but I’m happy to take a look at some of your proposals as they come together and offer my thoughts”). A clean break is best.

回到我自己的例子上，我也是通过固定日程来获得成功的。我也是极尽谨慎地使用个人生产效率词汇表中那个危险的词：“是”。说服我同意做浮浅工作是很难的。如果你让我去参加一些大学里无关紧要的公务，我会用招聘我入职的那位系主任的话来回应：“等我拿到终身教授资格再说吧。”我还有另外一个不错的技巧，就是明确地拒绝，但拒绝的理由则模糊处理。这样做的关键是避免给请求人提供机会，来否定你具体的拒绝理由。例如，如果我以在同一时刻有其他出差任务为理由来拒绝一次十分耗时的演讲，我不会提供细节——因为这样可以给请求人可乘之机，将活动安插到我现在的日程里——而只是说：“听起来很有趣，但是我的行程有冲突，恐怕参加不了。”我会拒绝此类任务，也会遏制内心的冲动，不去安抚邀请人，因为其结果往往会对我的行程造成同样的影响。（比如，“不好意思，我参加不了你们的委员会，但是我愿意看看你们的企划书，提出一些建议”。）简单干脆地拒绝是最好的。

In addition to carefully guarding my obligations, I’m incredibly conscientious about managing my time. Because my time is limited each day, I cannot afford to allow a large deadline to creep up on me, or a morning to be wasted on something trivial, because I didn’t take a moment to craft a smart plan. The Damoclean cap on the workday enforced by fixed-schedule productivity has a way of keeping my organization efforts sharp. Without this looming cutoff, I’d likely end up more lax in my habits.

除了小心谨慎地控制自己的责任外，我对个人时间的管理也极为负责。因为每天的时间都是有限的，我无法容忍重要的截止日期慢慢压迫着我，也不能容忍因为没有花时间制作一份精巧的计划，而在小事上浪费一个上午。固定日程生产力如达摩克利斯之剑高悬在工作日上，使我的日程安排十分紧凑。如果没有随时可能砍下的剑刃，我可能会有更多的懒惰习惯。

To summarize these observations, Nagpal and I can both succeed in academia without Tom-style overload due to two reasons. First, we’re asymmetric in the culling forced by our fixed-schedule commitment. By ruthlessly reducing the shallow while preserving the deep, this strategy frees up our time without diminishing the amount of new value we generate. Indeed, I would go so far as to argue that the reduction in shallow frees up *more* energy for the deep alternative, allowing us to produce more than if we had defaulted to a more typical crowded schedule. Second, the limits to our time necessitate more careful thinking about our organizational habits, also leading to more value produced as compared to longer but less organized schedules.

总而言之，纳帕尔和我之所以能够不似汤姆那样的加班，也能在学术上有所成就，原因有二。其一，我们采用固定日程的方法，在做选择的时候有所侧重。严格缩减浮浅工作，保持深度，在解放了时间的同时，保证我们创造的新价值也不会减少。实际上，我可以这样说，减少浮浅工作为实现深度工作节省了更多的精力，使我们的产出比采用密集日程安排时更高。其二，我们的时间有限，因而会更谨慎地思考个人的组织习惯，这也使得我们产出的价值能够高于采用长时间但混乱的日程安排的人。

The key claim of this strategy is that these same benefits hold for most knowledge work fields. That is, even if you’re not a professor, fixed-schedule productivity can yield powerful benefits. In most knowledge work jobs, it can be difficult in the moment to turn down a shallow commitment that seems harmless in isolation—be it accepting an invitation to get coffee or agreeing to “jump on a call.” A commitment to fixed-schedule productivity, however, shifts you into a scarcity mind-set. Suddenly any obligation beyond your deepest efforts is suspect and seen as potentially disruptive. Your default answer becomes no, the bar for gaining access to your time and attention rises precipitously, and you begin to organize the efforts that pass these obstacles with a ruthless efficiency. It might also lead you to test assumptions about your company’s work culture that you thought were ironclad but turn out to be malleable. It’s common, for example, to receive e-mails from your boss after hours. Fixed-schedule productivity would have you ignore these messages until the next morning. Many suspect that this would cause problems, as such responses are *expected*, but in many cases, the fact that your boss happens to be clearing her inbox at night doesn’t mean that she expects an immediate response—a lesson this strategy would soon help you discover.

该策略可以应用于大部分的知识工作领域。即使你不是教授，固定日程生产力也可以带来巨大的收益。在大多数的知识工作岗位上，想要拒绝一项单看无害的浮浅任务——可能是受邀去喝一杯茶或者是答应“开一个电话会议”，可能会很难。然而，专注于固定日程生产力可以使你进入稀缺思维方式。突然间任何深度工作之外的职责都变得可疑起来，被看作是潜在的干扰。你默认的答案可能就会变成“不”，能占用你时间和精力之事的准入门槛陡然上升。你开始用雷霆般的效率安排自己的精力处理这些难题。你也可能重新审视所在公司的工作文化，原本以为是铁一般的纪律，最后却发现也是有弹性的。举个例子，在发出邮件几个小时后才收到老板的回信是正常的。固定日程生产力却会让你不再急于等待邮件，可以在第二天早上查收。许多人怀疑这样做或许会带来麻烦，因为老板可能在等待你迅速回复。很多时候，你的老板只是碰巧在晚上处理自己的收件箱，但这并不意味着她需要立刻收到回复。这种策略将帮助你迅速发现这些规律。

Fixed-schedule productivity, in other words, is a *meta-habit* that’s simple to adopt but broad in its impact. If you have to choose just one behavior that reorients your focus toward the deep, this one should be high on your list of possibilities. If you’re still not sure, however, about the idea that artificial limits on your workday can make you more successful, I urge you to once again turn your attention to the career of fixed-schedule advocate Radhika Nagpal. In a satisfying coincidence, at almost the exact same time that Tom was lamenting online about his unavoidably intense workload as a young professor, Nagpal was celebrating the latest of the many professional triumphs she has experienced despite her fixed schedule: Her research was featured on the cover of the journal *Science*.

换言之，固定日程生产力是一种简单却影响广泛的超习惯。如果你只选择一种行为来重新确立自己关于深度工作的努力方向，它应该在你的备选单的前几位。但是，如果你仍然不确定刻意设置工作日工作时间上限的理念是否能够使你更成功，我建议你再次回顾固定日程拥趸拉蒂卡·纳帕尔的职业生涯。极为巧合的是，正当汤姆在网上叹息作为年轻教授不可避免地要面临巨大的工作压力时，纳帕尔（尽管她采用固定工作制），恰好取得了职业生涯里诸多成就中的一项：她最新的研究成果登上了《科学》杂志封面。

## Become Hard to Reach

No discussion of shallow work is complete without considering e-mail. This quintessential shallow activity is particularly insidious in its grip on most knowledge workers’ attention, as it delivers a steady stream of distractions *addressed specifically to you*. Ubiquitous e-mail access has become so ingrained in our professional habits that we’re beginning to lose the sense that we have any say in its role in our life. As John Freeman warns in his 2009 book, *The Tyranny of E-mail*, with the rise of this technology “we are slowly eroding our ability to explain—in a careful, complex way—why it is so wrong for us to complain, resist, or redesign our workdays so that they are manageable.” E-mail seems a fait accompli. Resistance is futile.

如果关于浮浅工作的讨论不包括电子邮件，那么这种讨论是不完整的。这种典型的浮浅活动偷走了知识工作者的大部分注意力，不断地给你干扰。随时登录电子邮箱已经成为根深蒂固的职业习惯，以至于我们都忘记了自己有权决定它在我们生活中的地位。正如约翰·弗里曼（John Freeman）2009 年出版的《电子邮件暴政》（The Tyranny of E-mail）一书中提出的警示：“我们慢慢蚀去了追本溯源的能力——以一种谨慎复杂的方式，几乎忽略了一个事实：我们抱怨、抵抗或是重新安排自己的工作日使其更易管理是无可厚非的。”被电子邮件支配似乎已经是既定的事实，所有的抵抗都是徒劳的。

This strategy pushes back at this fatalism. Just because you cannot avoid this tool altogether doesn’t mean you have to cede all authority over its role in your mental landscape. In the following sections I describe three tips that will help you regain authority over how this technology accesses your time and attention, and arrest the erosion of autonomy identified by Freeman. Resistance is not futile: You have more control over your electronic communication than you might at first assume.

本策略反驳了这种宿命论。你无法避免使用这种工具，并不意味着要放弃权力，任由它控制精神世界。在下面一节里，我将介绍三种技巧，帮助你重新掌握控制权，来决定这些技术如何使用你的时间和精力，遏制住弗里曼所说的自主权的侵蚀。抵抗不是徒劳的：你对电子通讯的控制力比最初想象的要强。

### Tip #1: Make People Who Send You E-mail Do More Work

Most nonfiction authors are easy to reach. They include an e-mail address on their author websites along with an open invitation to send them any request or suggestion that comes to mind. Many even encourage this feedback as a necessary commitment to the elusive but much-touted importance of “community building” among their readers. But here’s the thing: *I don’t buy it.*

大多数非小说作家是很容易联系到的。他们会在个人网页上公开电子邮箱地址，欢迎读者提出要求和建议。很多人甚至鼓励这种反馈行为，认为这是读者“社群建设”必需的。但我根本不吃这一套。

If you visit the contact page on my author website, there’s no general-purpose e-mail address. Instead, I list different individuals you can contact for specific purposes: my literary agent for rights requests, for example, or my speaking agent for speaking requests. If you want to reach me, I offer only a special-purpose e-mail address that comes with conditions and a lowered expectation that I’ll respond:

如果你访问我的作者网站联系人页面，并没有针对一般需求的电子邮箱地址；我根据不同人的需求列出不同的联系方式。比如，我的文学经纪人负责版权请求，演讲经纪人处理演讲邀请。如果你希望联系上我，可以在网站上找到一个特殊情况专用电子邮件地址，但有附带条件；还有，不要对收到回复抱太大期望：

> If you have an offer, opportunity, or introduction that might make my life more interesting, e-mail me at interesting [at] calnewport.com. For the reasons stated above, I’ll only respond to those proposals that are a good match for my schedule and interests.
>
> 如果你有能令我感兴趣或者是使我的生活更有趣的主意、机遇或简介，请给我发电子邮件到 interesting@Calnewport.com。如上文所述理由，我只会回应那些与我的日程安排相匹配或符合个人兴趣的邮件。

I call this approach a *sender filter*, as I’m asking my correspondents to filter themselves before attempting to contact me. This filter has significantly reduced the time I spend in my inbox. Before I began using a sender filter, I had a standard general-purpose e-mail address listed on my website. Not surprisingly, I used to receive a large volume of long e-mails asking for advice on specific (and often quite complicated) student or career questions. I like to help individuals, but these requests became overwhelming—they didn’t take the senders long to craft but they would require a lot of explanation and writing on my part to respond. My sender filter has eliminated most such communication, and in doing so, has drastically reduced the number of messages I encounter in my writing inbox. As for my own interest in helping my readers, I now redirect this energy toward settings I carefully choose to maximize impact. Instead of allowing any student in the world to send me a question, for example, I now work closely with a small number of student groups where I’m quite accessible and can offer more substantial and effective mentoring.

我将这种方法称作发件人过滤器，使那些试图联系我的人首先自我过滤一遍。这个过滤器大大减少了我在收件箱上所用的时间，我开始使用发件人过滤器之前，会在个人网站列出一个邮箱地址作为一个通用目的邮箱。不出所料，我经常收到大量长篇累牍的电子邮件，就具体的（常常是很复杂）学业或职业生涯问题征求意见。我乐于助人，但这些求助人的请求成为我的负担，使我无所适从。其实他们并没有花很多时间写邮件，但是我需要耗费很大的精力回应这些问题。发件人过滤器已经帮我屏蔽了大多数此类信件，并且大幅减少了我收到邮件的数量。说到帮助读者，我现在将精力着重投向精心挑选的群体，使效果最大化。比如，我现在不会回应世界上随便哪个学生的问题，而是与为数不多的几个学生群体密切合作。他们很容易就能联系上我，而我也可以为他们提供更切实有效的指导。

Another benefit of a sender filter is that it resets expectations. The most crucial line in my description is the following: “I’ll only respond to those proposals that are a good match for my schedule and interests.” This seems minor, but it makes a substantial difference in how my correspondents think about their messages to me. The default social convention surrounding e-mail is that unless you’re famous, if someone sends you something, you owe him or her a response. For most, therefore, an inbox full of messages generates a major sense of obligation.

发件人过滤器的另一个益处就是可以改变人的期望。我的叙述中最重要的一句是：“我只会回应那些与我的日程安排相匹配或符合个人兴趣的邮件。”这句话看似不起眼，但是对于通讯人如何看待自己的信件却有实质性影响。关于电子邮件的社会习俗认为，除非你是名人，否则不管何人发给你的何种邮件都是必须回复的。因此，对于大多数人而言，满满的收件箱会带来重大的责任感。

By instead resetting your correspondents’ expectations to the reality that you’ll probably *not* respond, the experience is transformed. The inbox is now a collection of opportunities that you can glance at when you have the free time—seeking out those that make sense for you to engage. But the pile of unread messages no longer generates a sense of obligation. You could, if you wanted to, ignore them all, and nothing bad would happen. Psychologically, this can be freeing.

通过调整给你写信人的期望，使他们意识到你可能不回信，这种情况就将大大改观。收件箱现在成了一个充满希望的地方，你可以在空闲时间浏览一下，找出那些值得处理的、有价值的邮件。这一大堆未读邮件再也不是重大的责任了。如果愿意的话，你可以忽略所有邮件，这样不会产生不良后果，但是在心理上却是极大的解脱。

I worried when I first began using a sender filter that it would seem pretentious—as if my time was more valuable than that of my readers—and that it would upset people. But this fear wasn’t realized. Most people easily accept the idea that you have a right to control *your own* incoming communication, as they would like to enjoy this same right. More important, people appreciate clarity. Most are okay to not receive a response if they don’t expect one (in general, those with a minor public presence, such as authors, overestimate how much people really care about their replies to their messages).

刚开始使用发件人过滤器的时候，我还担心会显得矫情，好似我的时间比读者的时间更有价值——这可能会使他们生气。但是担忧的这种事情并没有发生。大多数人很容易就接受了你有权控制自己私人通讯的权利，因为他们自己也想享有这种权利。更重要的是，人们喜欢明确清晰。如果没有得到答复的期待，也自然能坦然接受没有答复的现实（总体来说，作家之类很少在公众场合露面的人，高估了人们对他们回信的重视程度）。

In some cases, this expectation reset might even earn you *more* credit when you do respond. For example, an editor of an online publication once sent me a guest post opportunity with the assumption, set by my filter, that I would likely not respond. When I did, it proved a happy surprise. Here’s her summary of the interaction:

在某些案例中，这种期望值设定甚至可能为你的回应赢得更多的声望。比如，曾经有某网络出版商的编辑向我发了一封提供客座文章机会的邮件。按照过滤器设置的标准，我极有可能不会回复。当我回复了他之后，反而成了令人欣喜的意外。下文是她对这段交流的总结：

> So, when I emailed Cal to ask if he wanted to contribute to [the publication], my expectations were set. He didn’t have anything on his [sender filter] about wanting to guest blog, so there wouldn’t have been any hard feelings if I’d never heard a peep. Then, when he did respond, I was thrilled.
>
> 我给卡尔发送电子邮件，询问他是否愿意向我们的网站投稿时，已经有了预期。他在发件人过滤器里并没有提及想要写客座博客的事情，所以如果收不到他的回信，我也不会觉得难受。当他真的给我回信了的时候，我高兴极了。

My particular sender filter is just one example of this general strategy. Consider consultant Clay Herbert, who is an expert in running crowd-funding campaigns for technology start-ups: a specialty that attracts a lot of correspondents hoping to glean some helpful advice. As a Forbes.com article on sender filters reports, “At some point, the number of people reaching out exceeded [Herbert’s] capacity, so he created filters that put the onus on the person asking for help.”

我的发件人过滤器只是这种策略下的一例。我们来看一下克莱·赫伯特（Clay Herbert）的故事，他是为科技创业公司做众筹的专家：这个专业会吸引大量希望获得有用建议的来信。恰如福布斯网站关于过滤器的一篇报道中所述：“在一段时间里，来信数量超出了赫伯特的应对能力，所以他设置了过滤器，把负担转移到那些寻求帮助的人身上。”

Though he started from a similar motivation as me, Herbert’s filters ended up taking a different form. To contact him, you must first consult an FAQ to make sure your question has not already been answered (which was the case for a lot of the messages Herbert was processing before his filters were in place). If you make it through this FAQ sieve, he then asks you to fill out a survey that allows him to further screen for connections that seem particularly relevant to his expertise. For those who make it past this step, Herbert enforces a small fee you must pay before communicating with him. This fee is not about making extra money, but is instead about selecting for individuals who are serious about receiving and acting on advice. Herbert’s filters still enable him to help people and encounter interesting opportunities. But at the same time, they have reduced his incoming communication to a level he can easily handle.

虽然赫伯特和我的出发点相同，他采用的过滤器形式却有所不同。为了联系到他，你必须首先查阅“常见问题”，确认你的问题还没有得到回答（在采用这个过滤器之前，赫伯特需要经常回答重复的问题）。如果你通过了常见问题筛选，他会要求你填报一项调查，通过调查，他可以进一步筛选与个人专长极为相关的发件人。赫伯特要求通过这一步的人在联系自己之前交一小笔费用。这一笔费用并不是为了额外收入，而是为了选出那些真心寻求建议并愿意采纳的人。这些过滤器使赫伯特仍然能够帮助别人，以及遇到有趣的机会，但是与此同时，过滤器也帮助他将来信量降低到可以轻松处理的水平。

To give another example, consider Antonio Centeno, who runs the popular *Real Man Style* blog. Centeno’s sender filter lays out a two-step process. If you have a question, he diverts you to a public location to post it. Centeno thinks it’s wasteful to answer the same questions again and again in private one-on-one conversations. If you make it past this step, he then makes you commit to, by clicking check boxes, the following three promises:

再举一个安东尼奥·森特诺（Antonio Centeno）的例子，他经营一个名叫“纯爷们风格”的高人气博客。森特诺的发件人过滤器设置了一个双步骤的程序。如果你有问题，他会引导你到一个公众板块贴出来。森特诺认为用私人一对一的对话来一遍又一遍地回答相同的问题是十分不经济的。如果你过了这一步，他会让你点击几个复选框来做出以下三种承诺：

The message box in which you can type your message doesn’t appear on the contact page until after you’ve clicked the box by all three promises.

√我不是在问安东尼奥一个使用谷歌搜索 10 分钟就可以得到答案的问题。

√我不是复制粘贴了常见请求给安东尼奥发垃圾邮件，以推销我个人的不相关生意的。

√如果安东尼奥在 23 个小时内答复我，我将为某位陌生人做一件善事。

To summarize, the technologies underlying e-mail are transformative, but the current social conventions guiding how we apply this technology are underdeveloped. The notion that all messages, regardless of purpose or sender, arrive in the same undifferentiated inbox, and that there’s an expectation that every message deserves a (timely) response, is absurdly unproductive. The sender filter is a small but useful step toward a better state of affairs, and is an idea whose time has come—at least for the increasing number of entrepreneurs and freelancers who both receive a lot of incoming communication and have the ability to dictate their accessibility. (I’d also love to see similar rules become ubiquitous for intra-office communication in large organizations, but for the reasons argued in Chapter 2, we’re probably a long way from that reality.) If you’re in a position to do so, consider sender filters as a way of reclaiming some control over your time and attention.

总结而言，电子邮件背后的技术是革命性的，但是当前指导我们如何应用这些技术的社会习俗却是落伍的。认为不论发件人和目的，所有信息都应不加区分地发至同一收件箱的理念，以及任何邮件都应该得到（及时）回复的理念，都是荒谬的。发件人过滤器是改善此状态十分有效的一个小技巧，也是顺应潮流的——至少对越来越多的企业主和自由职业者来说是这样的，他们不仅收到大量的来信，也有能力决定自己的可及性。（我也希望看到类似的规则能被应用到大型组织的办公室内部通信上，但是考虑到第二章论及的理由，想要实现这点愿望恐怕还需时日。）如果条件允许，您可以考虑使用发件人过滤器，重新夺回对时间和注意力的控制。

### Tip #2: Do More Work When You Send or Reply to E-mails

Consider the following standard e-mails:

请阅读思考以下几封普通的电子邮件：

**E-mail #1**: “It was great to meet you last week. I’d love to follow up on some of those issues we discussed. Do you want to grab coffee?”

**电子邮件 1**：“上周和你相聚很棒。我想继续探讨一下我们讨论过的一些问题。你想喝咖啡吗？”

**E-mail #2**: “We should get back to the research problem we discussed during my last visit. Remind me where we are with that?”

**电子邮件 2**：“我们应该继续探讨我上次拜访时讨论的研究问题。提醒我一下，上次我们谈到哪儿了？”

**E-mail #3**: “I took a stab at that article we discussed. It’s attached. Thoughts?”

**电子邮件 3**：“我尝试写了我们讨论过的那篇文章，随邮件附上。有什么意见？”

These three examples should be familiar to most knowledge workers, as they’re representative of many of the messages that fill their inboxes. They’re also potential productivity land mines: How you respond to them will have a significant impact on how much time and attention the resulting conversation ultimately consumes.

这三个例子对知识工作者来说应该都不陌生，代表了他们收件箱中无数类似的邮件。这些邮件可能是葬送产出的地雷：如何回复这些邮件将极大地影响到接下来的对话，进而决定了将要占用你多少时间和注意力。

In particular, interrogative e-mails like these generate an initial instinct to dash off the quickest possible response that will clear the message—temporarily—out of your inbox. A quick response will, in the short term, provide you with some minor relief because you’re bouncing the responsibility implied by the message off your court and back onto the sender’s. This relief, however, is short-lived, as this responsibility will continue to bounce back again and again, continually sapping your time and attention. I suggest, therefore, that the right strategy when faced with a question of this type is to pause a moment before replying and take the time to answer the following key prompt:

一般情况下，人们面对这种询问式的电子邮件，本能的反应是尽快回复，把这些信息从收件箱中暂时性地清除。从短期看来，简短的回复可以使你得到稍许的宽慰，因为你将信息附带的责任踢回给了发件人。然而，这种宽慰只是暂时的，因为义务将会在你们之间踢来踢去，持续占用你的时间和注意力。因此，我建议正确处理这类问题的策略是在回复之前暂停片刻，并思考以下关键提示：

> What is the project represented by this message, and what is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this project to a successful conclusion?
>
> 这条信息指向哪一个项目，成功完成项目的最有效流程（就产生的信息数量而言）是什么？

Once you’ve answered this question for yourself, replace a quick response with one that takes the time to describe the process you identified, points out the current step, and emphasizes the step that comes next. I call this the *process-centric approach* to e-mail, and it’s designed to minimize both the number of e-mails you receive and the amount of mental clutter they generate.

一旦你自己回答了这个问题，就取消那个快速回复，多花一些时间把你发现的流程写下来，指出当前处于哪一个步骤，然后强调接下来的步骤。我把这称作电子邮件的流程导向方法。其目的在于减少你所收到的电子邮件数量和因之而来的思维混乱。

To better explain this process and why it works consider the following process-centric responses to the sample e-mails from earlier:

为了更好地解释这个过程及其工作原理，让我们用流程导向方法来回应之前的电子邮件：

**Process-Centric Response to E-mail #1**: “I’d love to grab coffee. Let’s meet at the Starbucks on campus. Below I listed two days next week when I’m free. For each day, I listed three times. If any of those day and time combinations work for you, let me know. I’ll consider your reply confirmation for the meeting. If none of those date and time combinations work, give me a call at the number below and we’ll hash out a time that works. Looking forward to it.”

**对于电子邮件 1 的流程导向回应**：“喝杯咖啡不错。我们在校园的星巴克碰头吧。我在下面列出了下周有空的两天。每一天，我都列出了三个时段。如果其中某一天的某个时段你也合适的话，通知我。如果你回复了就当作是确认了会面。如果没有合适的时间，下面是我的号码，可以给我打个电话，我们可以商量一个合适的时间。期待您的回复。”

**Process-Centric Response to E-mail #2**: “I agree that we should return to this problem. Here’s what I suggest…

**对于电子邮件 2 的流程导向回应**：“我同意你的想法，应该继续讨论这个问题，下面是我的建议……

“Sometime in the next week e-mail me everything you remember about our discussion on the problem. Once I receive that message, I’ll start a shared directory for the project and add to it a document that summarizes what you sent me, combined with my own memory of our past discussion. In the document, I’ll highlight the two or three most promising next steps.

“下周找个时间，把你还记得我们就此问题进行做过的讨论发电子邮件给我。收到来信后，我将建立一个关于该项目的共享目录。总结你发给我的材料以及我自己关于之前讨论的回忆，写成文件，加入到目录里。在文件里，我将标亮我认为最值得讨论的两三项工作。

“We can then take a crack at those next steps for a few weeks and check back in. I suggest we schedule a phone call for a month from now for this purpose. Below I listed some dates and times when I’m available for a call. When you respond with your notes, indicate the date and time combination that works best for you and we’ll consider that reply confirmation for the call. I look forward to digging into this problem.”

“我们可以在接下来的几周内尝试并核对这几项工作。我建议就此事安排一次电话交流，时间定在一个月后。下边列了一些我有时间接电话的日期和时间。你整理好笔记回复的时候，标明最适合你的日期和时间，回复就相当于确认了电话交流一事。期望我们能够深入研究这个问题。”

**Process-Centric Response to E-mail #3**: “Thanks for getting back to me. I’m going to read this draft of the article and send you back an edited version annotated with comments on Friday (the 10th). In this version I send back, I’ll edit what I can do myself, and add comments to draw your attention to places where I think you’re better suited to make the improvement. At that point, you should have what you need to polish and submit the final draft, so I’ll leave you to do that—no need to reply to this message or to follow up with me after I return the edits—unless, of course, there’s an issue.”

**对于电子邮件 3 的流程导向回应**：“感谢回信，我将阅读草稿并于本周五（10 号）发回带批论的修改版本。在回复的版本中，能改的我就直接做了编辑，并在一些我认为应该完善的地方添加批注以引起你的注意。届时，你应该了解到哪些地方需要完善，并提交最终草稿。无须回复本信息，也不用在我返还编辑稿后跟进交流，你可以放手去做，当然有问题时可以联系我。”

In crafting these sample responses, I started by identifying the project implied by the message. Notice, the word “project” is used loosely here. It can cover things that are large and obviously projects, such as making progress on a research problem (Example #2), but it applies just as easily to small logistical challenges like setting up a coffee meeting (Example #1). I then took a minute or two to think through a process that gets us from the current state to a desired outcome with a minimum of messages required. The final step was to write a reply that clearly describes this process and where we stand. These examples centered on an e-mail reply, but it should be clear that a similar approach also works when writing an e-mail message from scratch.

在草拟这些回复范本时，我开始先确认信息中所指的项目。请注意，“项目”在此是一个宽泛的词。它可以包括大而明显的项目，包括在一个研究项目上取得进展（例 2），但是也包括了诸如约定咖啡聚会等小的事务性问题（例 1）。然后我用一到两分钟思考从当前状态发展到想要的结果，需要信息量最少的流程。最后一步就是写一封回复，认真叙述这个流程并讲明我们当前的状况。这些例子都是关于电子邮件的回复，应该需要明确的是，类似的方法也可以用于起草电子邮件。

The process-centric approach to e-mail can significantly mitigate the impact of this technology on your time and attention. There are two reasons for this effect. First, it reduces the number of e-mails in your inbox—sometimes significantly (something as simple as scheduling a coffee meeting can easily spiral into half a dozen or more messages over a period of many days, if you’re not careful about your replies). This, in turn, reduces the time you spend in your inbox and reduces the brainpower you must expend when you do.

处理电子邮件的流程导向方法可以大大减轻科技给你的时间和注意力带来的负担。原因有二：一是此法减少了你收件箱中电子邮件的数量，有时甚至会大幅减少（如果你不仔细编辑回信的话，像安排一个咖啡聚会这么简单的事情可能需要接下来几天连续发六七条信息才能解决问题）。这样就可以减少你花在收件箱上的时间和用在这上面的脑力。

Second, to steal terminology from David Allen, a good process-centric message immediately “closes the loop” with respect to the project at hand. When a project is initiated by an e-mail that you send or receive, it squats in your mental landscape—becoming something that’s “on your plate” in the sense that it has been brought to your attention and eventually needs to be addressed. This method closes this open loop as soon as it forms. By working through the whole process, adding to your task lists and calendar any relevant commitments on your part, and bringing the other party up to speed, your mind can reclaim the mental real estate the project once demanded. Less mental clutter means more mental resources available for deep thinking.

二是，用大卫·艾伦的话来说，一个好的流程导向信息可以立即把当前的项目“闭合”。当你收发的电子邮件发起了一个项目，这个项目就会潜伏在你的思维中——它成了“你的盘子里”的东西，它将占用你的注意力并最终需要你来解决。用这个方法可以把这一切扼杀在萌芽之中。通过拟定出全套的流程，在任务表和日历中添加所有与你相关的任务，并让对方也忙起来，可以使你的思维重新夺回被这个项目占据的思维空间。减少了思维杂乱，意味着有更多脑力资源可以用来进行深度思考。

Process-centric e-mails might not seem natural at first. For one thing, they require that you spend more time thinking about your messages before you compose them. In the moment, this might seem like you’re spending *more* time on e-mail. But the important point to remember is that the extra two to three minutes you spend at this point will save you many more minutes reading and responding to unnecessary extra messages later.

流程导向的电子邮件可能乍一看不自然。一方面，它们需要你在编写之前花更多的时间来思考如何写。在这个时候，看起来好像你在电子邮件上花了更多的时间。但是在这个重要的关口上，你要明白多花两三分钟就可以避免之后收发多余的不必要信息，为你节省更多的时间。

The other issue is that process-centric messages can seem stilted and overly technical. The current social conventions surrounding e-mail promote a conversational tone that clashes with the more systematic schedules or decision trees commonly used in process-centric communication. If this concerns you, I suggest that you add a longer conversational preamble to your messages. You can even separate the process-centric portion of the message from the conversational opening with a divider line, or label it “Proposed Next Steps,” so that its technical tone seems more appropriate in context.

另一方面，流程导向的信息可能显得呆板，过于技术流。当前关于电子邮件的社会习惯是倾向于使用对话体的语调，这与流程导向交流中通常使用的系统化安排和决策树是相冲突的。如果你介意这一点，我建议你在自己的信息前加一个长一点的对话体的序言。你甚至可以在信息中流程导向部分与对话体开头之间划出分割线，或者把流程导向部分标为“下一步工作建议”，这样一来，技术流的语调就不会显得那么突兀了。

In the end, these minor hassles are worth it. By putting more thought up front into what’s really being proposed by the e-mail messages that flit in and out of your inbox, you’ll greatly reduce the negative impact of this technology on your ability to do work that actually matters.

最后要说的是，忍受这些小的麻烦是值得的。对你收发的电子邮件信息里所提出的建议多花一点心思，可以大大减少电子邮件对你的负面影响，保护自己深度工作的能力。

### Tip #3: Don’t Respond

As a graduate student at MIT, I had the opportunity to interact with famous academics. In doing so, I noticed that many shared a fascinating and somewhat rare approach to e-mail: Their default behavior when receiving an e-mail message is to *not* respond.

作为一名麻省理工的毕业生，我有机会同知名学者交流。在交流的过程中，我发现他们许多人都有一个关于电子邮件的使用方法，这种方法极好，用的人也不多：对于收到的电子邮件，他们的默认反应是不予回复。

Over time, I learned the philosophy driving this behavior: When it comes to e-mail, they believed, it’s the sender’s responsibility to convince the receiver that a reply is worthwhile. If you didn’t make a convincing case *and* sufficiently minimize the effort required by the professor to respond, you didn’t get a response.

慢慢地，我理解了这种行为背后的逻辑：他们认为使用电子邮件时，使收件人相信邮件值得一读是发件人的责任。如果你的邮件不够有说服力并且不能充分降低教授回复邮件所需的精力，那么你就得不到回复。

For example, the following e-mail would likely not generate a reply with many of the famous names at the Institute:

例如，下面的这封电子邮件，麻省理工的名人恐怕很多都不会回复：

> Hi professor. I’d love to stop by sometime to talk about \<topic X\>. Are you available?

> 教授好。我想有机会过来拜访您，讨论一下“课题甲”。您有空吗？

Responding to this message requires too much work (“Are you available?” is too vague to be answered quickly). Also, there’s no attempt to argue that this chat is worth the professor’s time. With these critiques in mind, here’s a version of the same message that would be more likely to generate a reply:

回复这条信息需要很多的工作（“您有空吗？”太含混，无法马上回答）。另外，这封邮件也没有试图说明这次交流是否值得教授花时间。知道了这些标准，我们就可以写一封更有可能得到教授回复的邮件：

> Hi professor. I’m working on a project similar to \<topic X\> with my advisor, \<professor Y\>. Is it okay if I stop by in the last fifteen minutes of your office hours on Thursday to explain what we’re up to in more detail and see if it might complement your current project?

> 教授好。我正在与我的导师“乙教授”开展一个与 “课题甲”类似的项目。请问我可以在周四您办公时间的最后 15 分钟拜访您吗？届时可以向您更详细地介绍我们的进展，并探讨这些是否对您当前的项目有所裨益？

Unlike the first message, this one makes a clear case for why this meeting makes sense and minimizes the effort needed from the receiver to respond.

这一封邮件和第一封不同，清楚地说明了为什么这次会面有价值，也减少了收信人答复时所需要付出的精力。

This tip asks that you replicate, to the extent feasible in your professional context, this professorial ambivalence to e-mail. To help you in this effort, try applying the following three rules to sort through which messages require a response and which do not.

该贴士建议你在职业环境允许的情况下，模仿教授对待电子邮件的矛盾方法。为了更好地帮助你，请尝试使用以下三条规则，以区分哪些信息需要回，哪些不需要。

Professorial E-mail Sorting: Do not reply to an e-mail message if any of the following applies:

教授的电子邮件分类法（如果一封电子邮件信息存在以下任何一点，请不要回复）：

- It’s ambiguous or otherwise makes it hard for you to generate a reasonable response. 邮件相当含混或者存在其他问题，很难给一个合理的回复。

- It’s not a question or proposal that interests you. 你对这个问题或者提议不感兴趣。

- Nothing really good would happen if you did respond and nothing really bad would happen if you didn’t. 如果你回复了，不会有好结果；如果你不回复，也不会有坏结果。

In all cases, there are many obvious exceptions. If an ambiguous message about a project you don’t care about comes from your company’s CEO, for example, you’ll respond. But looking beyond these exceptions, this professorial approach asks you to become way more ruthless when deciding whether or not to click “reply.”

关于以上三点，现实中存在大量显而易见的例外。比如你收到一封来自公司首席执行官的邮件，即使内容是关于一个你不关心的项目，给出的信息含混不清，你也得回复。除此类特例之外，采用教授使用的这种方法，就要在决定是否点下“回复”键的时候更加果决。

This tip can be uncomfortable at first because it will cause you to break a key convention currently surrounding e-mail: Replies are assumed, regardless of the relevance or appropriateness of the message. There’s also no way to avoid that some bad things will happen if you take this approach. At the minimum, some people might get confused or upset—especially if they’ve never seen standard e-mail conventions questioned or ignored. Here’s the thing: This is okay. As the author Tim Ferriss once wrote: “Develop the habit of letting small bad things happen. If you don’t, you’ll never find time for the life-changing big things.” It should comfort you to realize that, as the professors at MIT discovered, people are quick to adjust their expectations to the specifics of your communication habits. The fact you didn’t respond to their hastily scribed messages is probably not a central event in their lives.

刚开始使用这个贴士可能会使你感觉不自在，因为这样做要求你摒弃当前关于电子邮件的重要惯例：不论信息是否相关以及是否重要，每一封邮件都将得到回复。采用这个方法后，发生一些不愉快的事情也是在所难免。有些人或许会感到疑惑或生气，尤其是那些从来没碰到过质疑或无视当前电子邮件惯例的人。其实呢，这没什么大不了的。正如作家蒂姆·菲利斯（Tim Ferriss）曾经写到的：“培养允许坏的小事发生的习惯。否则，你将永远发现不了改变命运的大事。”另外麻省理工的教授也发现，人们会很快调整对你的期望，适应你的社交习惯。你不回复他们匆忙写下的信息，这件事应该不会是他们生活中的重大事件。

Once you get past the discomfort of this approach, you’ll begin to experience its rewards. There are two common tropes bandied around when people discuss solutions to e-mail overload. One says that sending e-mails generates more e-mails, while the other says that wrestling with ambiguous or irrelevant e-mails is a major source of inbox-related stress. The approach suggested here responds aggressively to both issues—you send fewer e-mails and ignore those that aren’t easy to process—and by doing so will significantly weaken the grip your inbox maintains over your time and attention.

一旦你适应了这种方法带来的不适，你就能感觉到它带来的好处。人们在讨论如何解决海量的电子邮件时常用到两个说法。一种说法是电子邮件将带来更多的电子邮件，另一种说法是费力处理含混或者无关的电子邮件是收件箱压力的主要来源。我们提出的这个方法建议积极主动地处理这两个问题：少发邮件，同时忽略那些难以处理的邮件。通过这个方法，你可以大大减少收件箱占用的时间和注意力。
