# Conclusion

The story of Microsoft’s founding has been told so many times that it’s entered the realm of legend. In the winter of 1974, a young Harvard student named Bill Gates sees the Altair, the world’s first personal computer, on the cover of *Popular Electronics*. Gates realizes that there’s an opportunity to design software for the machine, so he drops everything and with the help of Paul Allen and Monte Davidoff spends the next eight weeks hacking together a version of the BASIC programming language for the Altair. This story is often cited as an example of Gates’s insight and boldness, but recent interviews have revealed another trait that played a crucial role in the tale’s happy ending: Gates’s preternatural deep work ability.

微软公司创立的故事广为流传，如今已成为一段传奇。1974 年的冬天，一位名叫比尔·盖茨的年轻哈佛学生在《大众电子》（Popular Electronics）杂志的封面看到了“牵牛星”（Altair），这是世界上第一台个人电脑。盖茨意识到为这台机器编写程序是个机会，于是他抛弃所有，在保罗·艾伦和蒙特·大卫杜夫的帮助下，用接下来的 8 个星期为牵牛星设计了一套 BASIC 编程语言。这个故事经常用来证明盖茨的远见和勇敢，但是近来的一些采访展现了在盖茨的成功故事中起到至关重要作用的另外一种品质：盖茨异乎寻常的深度工作能力。

As Walter Isaacson explained in a 2013 article on the topic for the *Harvard Gazette*, Gates worked with such intensity for such lengths during this two-month stretch that he would often collapse into sleep on his keyboard in the middle of writing a line of code. He would then sleep for an hour or two, wake up, and pick up right where he left off—an ability that a still-impressed Paul Allen describes as “a prodigious feat of concentration.” In his book *The Innovators*, Isaacson later summarized Gates’s unique tendency toward depth as follows: “The one trait that differentiated [Gates from Allen] was focus. Allen’s mind would flit between many ideas and passions, but Gates was a serial obsessor.”

正如瓦尔特·艾萨克森 2013 年在《哈佛报》（Harvard Gazette）上发表的一篇同主题文章所述：在两个月的时间里，盖茨如此努力地工作，以至于常常在写代码的时候睡倒在键盘上。之后，他会接着睡一两个小时，醒来后继续写下去。盖茨的这种能力至今仍令保罗·艾伦印象深刻，将其称为“专注力的惊人之举”。艾萨克森后来在《创新者》（The Innovators）中是这样总结盖茨对于深度工作的独特情结：区别盖茨与艾伦的特质就是专注力。艾伦的头脑中满满的都是点子与激情，而盖茨则痴迷专注于一件又一件事。

It’s here, in this story of Gates’s obsessive focus, that we encounter the strongest form of my argument for deep work. It’s easy, amid the turbulence of a rapidly evolving information age, to default to dialectical grumbling. The curmudgeons among us are vaguely uneasy about the attention people pay to their phones, and pine for the days of unhurried concentration, while the digital hipsters equate such nostalgia with Luddism and boredom, and believe that increased connection is the foundation for a utopian future. Marshall McLuhan declared that “the medium is the message,” but our current conversation on these topics seems to imply that “the medium is morality”—either you’re on board with the Facebook future or see it as our downfall.

在盖茨沉迷于专注的这个故事中，我们找到了关于深度工作的最有力论据。在这个日新月异的信息时代，人们容易出现两种辩证的牢骚。急脾气的人对于人们在手机上投入的注意力感到隐隐不安，怀念以前专注于某件事那种悠然自得的日子；然而电子发烧友却认为这种怀旧是卢德主义，很无聊，并且认为日益紧密的联系才是未来乌托邦的基础。马歇尔·麦克卢汉（Marshall McLuhan）说“媒介就是信息”，但是我们当前在这个领域的对话却暗含了“媒介就是道德”的意味——你不是同意脸谱网代表未来，就是将其看成是人类的堕落。

As I emphasized in this book’s introduction, I have no interest in this debate. A commitment to deep work is not a moral stance and it’s not a philosophical statement—it is instead a pragmatic recognition that the ability to concentrate is a skill that *gets valuable things done*. Deep work is important, in other words, not because distraction is evil, but because it enabled Bill Gates to start a billion-dollar industry in less than a semester.

正如我在本书的前言中所强调的，我无意于这场辩论。致力于深度工作并不涉及道德立场，也不是一种哲学论断，而只是从实用角度认可专注的能力可以完成有价值的事情。换言之，我们说深度工作是重要的，不是因为分心是邪恶的，而是因为深度工作能够使比尔·盖茨在一个学期创立起 10 亿美元的产业。

This is also a lesson, as it turns out, that I’ve personally relearned again and again in my own career. I’ve been a depth devotee for more than a decade, but even I am still regularly surprised by its power. When I was in graduate school, the period when I first encountered and started prioritizing this skill, I found that deep work allowed me to write a pair of quality peer-reviewed papers each year (a respectable rate for a student), while rarely having to work past five on weekdays or work at all on weekends (a rarity among my peers).

我个人在职业生涯中也不断地加深对这一道理的认识。我作为深度工作拥趸已经十多年了，但是我仍然会经常惊讶于它的力量。我在读研究生时，第一次了解到并开始着重利用深度工作这种技能，使我不用在工作日和整个周末加班（在我的同学中很少见），还能每年都写出两篇同行审评的高质量论文（对于一名学生而言，已经很了不起了）。

As I neared my transition to professorship, however, I began to worry. As a student and a postdoc my time commitments were minimal—leaving me most of my day to shape as I desired. I knew I would lose this luxury in the next phase of my career, and I wasn’t confident in my ability to integrate enough deep work into this more demanding schedule to maintain my productivity. Instead of just stewing in my anxiety, I decided to do something about it: I created a plan to bolster my deep work muscles.

然而，当我将要升为教授时，又开始担心了起来。作为一名学生、博士后，我投入的时间是最少的，我按照自己的想法安排了一天中大部分的时间。我知道，在我职业生涯的下一阶段，或许无法再有这样奢侈的特权，因为我不确信自己是否可以实现足够的深度工作，融入到要求更高的日程安排中，保持自己的产出。我不愿坐以待毙，决定尝试一种提高个人深度工作能力的锻炼计划。

These training efforts were deployed during my last two years at MIT, while I was a postdoc starting to look for professor positions. My main tactic was to introduce artificial constraints on my schedule, so as to better approximate the more limited free time I expected as a professor. In addition to my rule about not working at night, I started to take extended lunch breaks in the middle of the day to go for a run and then eat lunch back at my apartment. I also signed a deal to write my fourth book, *So Good They Can’t Ignore You*, during this period—a project, of course, that soon levied its own intense demands on my time.

我在麻省理工的最后两年展开了这些训练，当时我正攻读博士后并开始寻找教授职位。我主要的策略就是对日程进行刻意的限制，以更好地估算出成为教授后难得的自由时间预期。除了不在夜晚工作的原则外，我开始安排更多的午饭休息时间，先跑步，然后再把午餐带回到公寓。在这期间，我还签了第 4 本书《优秀到不能被忽视》（So Good They Can’t Ignore You）的写作合同——当然，这个项目迅速占用了我大量的时间。

To compensate for these new constraints, I refined my ability to work deeply. Among other methods, I began to more carefully block out deep work hours and preserve them against incursion. I also developed an ability to carefully work through thoughts during the many hours I spent on foot each week (a boon to my productivity), and became obsessive about finding disconnected locations conducive to focus. During the summer, for example, I would often work under the dome in Barker Engineering library—a pleasingly cavernous location that becomes too crowded when class is in session, and during the winter, I sought more obscure locations for some silence, eventually developing a preference for the small but well-appointed Lewis Music Library. At some point, I even bought a $50 high-end grid-lined lab notebook to work on mathematical proofs, believing that its expense would induce more care in my thinking.

为了抵消这些新限制的影响，我又进一步完善了自己的深度工作能力。我尝试了很多方法，我会更细致地圈划出深度工作时间，避免在这些时间段受打扰。我还培养出在每周步行的多个小时里认真梳理思路的能力（对我的产出大有裨益），并且特别痴迷于寻找利于聚精会神的偏僻之所。比如，在这个夏天，我会经常到贝克工程图书馆的穹顶下工作，那是一个非常讨人喜欢的洞穴式建筑，但在学期中会挤满人。在冬季，我会寻找更偏僻的处所以获得安宁，最终我爱上了小而精致的路易斯音乐图书馆。在某些时候，我甚至会买 50 美元一本的实验室用高级网格笔记本来做数学验证，因为我认为高成本会引导我在思考时更细心。

I ended up surprised by how well this recommitment to depth ended up working. After I’d taken a job as a computer science professor at Georgetown University in the fall of 2011, my obligations did in fact drastically increase. But I had been training for this moment. Not only did I preserve my research productivity; it actually *improved*. My previous rate of two good papers a year, which I maintained as an unencumbered graduate student, leapt to four good papers a year, on average, once I became a much more encumbered professor.

我最后惊喜地发现，所有的这些努力都得到了回报。我于 2011 年秋天在乔治城大学获得了计算机科学教授的工作，但我的实际工作量并没有大幅增加。由于我在相当长的一段时期里一直训练自己，我的研究效率不仅没有受影响，反而提高了。我研究生期间那段轻松的时光里，一年可以写两篇好论文，成为教授后，虽然工作任务更多，但是发表的论文数却提高到了平均每年 4 篇。

Impressive as this was to me, however, I was soon to learn that I had not yet reached the limits of what deep work could produce. This lesson would come during my third year as a professor. During my third year at Georgetown, which spanned the fall of 2013 through the summer of 2014, I turned my attention back to my deep work habits, searching for more opportunities to improve. A big reason for this recommitment to depth is the book you’re currently reading—most of which was written during this period. Writing a seventy-thousand-word book manuscript, of course, placed a sudden new constraint on my already busy schedule, and I wanted to make sure my academic productivity didn’t take a corresponding hit. Another reason I turned back to depth was the looming tenure process. I had a year or two of publications left before my tenure case was submitted. *This*was the time, in other words, to make a statement about my abilities (especially given that my wife and I were planning on growing our family with a second child in the final year before tenure). The final reason I turned back to depth was more personal and (admittedly) a touch petulant. I had applied and been rejected for a well-respected grant that many of my colleagues were receiving. I was upset and embarrassed, so I decided that instead of just complaining or wallowing in self-doubt, I would compensate for losing the grant by increasing the rate and impressiveness of my publications—allowing them to declare on my behalf that I actually *did* know what I was doing, even if this one particular grant application didn’t go my way.

这令我大吃一惊，但是我很快就意识到自己其实还没有达到深度工作的极致。我在成为教授之后的第三年意识到了这一点。在乔治城的第三年，也就是从 2013 年的秋天到 2014 年夏天，我开始重新审视自己的深度工作习惯，寻求更多的进步空间。这其中的原因与你当前读的这本书有很大关系——本书的大部分内容是在那个阶段写就的。写出一本 7 万字的书稿，自然而然地给我本已经紧凑的日程添了新的负担，因为我不想让写作影响到我的学术事业。我转向深度工作的另外一个原因是即将到来的终身教职申办。在提交终身教职申请之前，我还有一两年的时间写论文。换言之，这是一个展示我个人能力的关键时刻（尤其是在我参评终身教职前的最后一年，我太太和我准备生第二个孩子）。我转向深度工作的最后一个原因是更加私人的，并且（坦诚讲）有些任性。我申请了一个特别著名的项目拨款却被拒绝了，但是许多同事都申请到了。我感觉十分沮丧和尴尬，于是决定不再抱怨，也不要怀疑自己，而是要增加自己出版文章的数量和质量，弥补得不到拨款的损失——让这些文章为我证明，即使得不到这项拨款，我也确实知道自己在做什么。

I was already an adept deep worker, but these three forces drove me to push this habit to an extreme. I became ruthless in turning down time-consuming commitments and began to work more in isolated locations outside my office. I placed a tally of my deep work hours in a prominent position near my desk and got upset when it failed to grow at a fast enough rate. Perhaps most impactful, I returned to my MIT habit of working on problems in my head whenever a good time presented itself—be it walking the dog or commuting. Whereas earlier, I tended to increase my deep work only as a deadline approached, this year I was relentless—most every day of most every week I was pushing my mind to grapple with results of consequence, regardless of whether or not a specific deadline was near. I solved proofs on subway rides and while shoveling snow. When my son napped on the weekend, I would pace the yard thinking, and when stuck in traffic I would methodically work through problems that were stymieing me.

我已经是一个熟练的深度工作者，但是这三个原因使我能将这种习惯推向极致。我开始果决地拒绝耗时的约会，在办公室外更封闭的环境里工作。我在办公桌附近显眼的位置放上计分板，记下我深度工作的时间。当这些计分板没有按照预期的速度累积时，我会变得不安。可能最有效的是，我恢复了自己在麻省理工时的习惯：不论是遛狗还是在上下班路上，一旦有好的时机我就开始思索解决手头上的问题。在此之前，我只是在接近最后期限的时候才增加深度工作时间。今年，无论是否有一个明确的最后期限，我无时无刻不严格地敦促自己着力于有意义的任务。在搭地铁的路上，在铲雪的时候，我会处理文章校样。周末当我儿子小睡时，我就绕着院子踱步思索。当遇到交通阻塞时，我就开始有条理地解决那些困扰着我的问题。

As this year progressed, I became a deep work machine—and the result of this transformation caught me off guard. During the same year that I wrote a book and my oldest son entered the terrible twos, I managed to more than double my average academic productivity, publishing *nine* peer-reviewed papers—all the while maintaining my prohibition on work in the evenings.

随着这一年的慢慢过去，我变成了一台深度工作机器——这个转变带来的结果令我猝不及防。这一年里，我写完了一本书，我的大儿子到了两岁这个令人不省心的年龄，与此同时，我还将学术方面的平均产出提升了一倍多：在坚持晚上不工作的前提下，发表了 9 篇同行审评文章。

I’m the first to admit that my year of extreme depth was perhaps a bit too extreme: It proved cognitively exhausting, and going forward I’ll likely moderate this intensity. But this experience reinforces the point that opened this conclusion: Deep work is *way more* powerful than most people understand. It’s a commitment to this skill that allowed Bill Gates to make the most of an unexpected opportunity to create a new industry, and that allowed me to double my academic productivity the same year I decided to concurrently write a book. To leave the distracted masses to join the focused few, I’m arguing, is a transformative experience.

我必须要承认这一年激进的深度工作或许过于激进：这段经历十分消耗脑力，在未来我将缓和强度。但是这段经历印证了我结论的第一点：深度工作远比大多数人所了解的强大。正是坚持使用这个技能，使得比尔·盖茨抓住了突然而至的机遇并开创了一项新产业，使得我能够在写一本书的同一年里把学术方面的产出提高一倍。脱离思想不集中的大众，加入那些能集中精力的少数人群，我认为这是一个能让你脱胎换骨的转变。

The deep life, of course, is not for everybody. It requires hard work and drastic changes to your habits. For many, there’s a comfort in the artificial busyness of rapid e-mail messaging and social media posturing, while the deep life demands that you leave much of that behind. There’s also an uneasiness that surrounds any effort to produce the best things you’re capable of producing, as this forces you to confront the possibility that your best is not (yet) that good. It’s safer to comment on our culture than to step into the Rooseveltian ring and attempt to wrestle it into something better.

当然，深度的生活并不是适合所有人。你需要为此付出艰苦的努力，从根本上改变你的习惯。对于很多人来说，快速地收发电子邮件和在社交媒体上发消息所带来的繁忙假象会给他们带来慰藉，深度的生活却是要你摆脱这些东西。在你尽个人全力去创造一件美好的事物时，会有一种不安牵扰着你，因为这迫使你面对自己最好的成果（暂且）还没有那么好的可能。与涉足政坛，期望做出一番事业相比，夸夸其谈地品论我们的文化会显得更安全。

But if you’re willing to sidestep these comforts and fears, and instead struggle to deploy your mind to its fullest capacity to create things that matter, then you’ll discover, as others have before you, that depth generates a life rich with productivity and meaning. In Part 1, I quoted writer Winifred Gallagher saying, “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.” I agree. So does Bill Gates. And hopefully now that you’ve finished this book, you agree too.

但是如果你愿意跨过这些舒适区和恐惧，将自己的头脑发挥到极致，创造出有价值的东西，你将会如前人一样发现，深度能造就富有效率和意义的生活。在第一部分里，我引用了作者威妮弗雷德·加拉格尔的话：“我将活出专注的人生，因为这是最好的选择。”我赞同这句话，比尔·盖茨也赞同。希望你在读完这本书之后也会赞同。
