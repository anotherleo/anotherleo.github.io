# Deep Work

In the Swiss canton of St. Gallen, near the northern banks of Lake Zurich, is a village named Bollingen. In 1922, the psychiatrist Carl Jung chose this spot to begin building a retreat[^1]. He began with a basic two-story stone house he called the Tower. After returning from a trip to India, where he observed the practice of adding meditation rooms to homes, he expanded the complex[^2] to include a private office. “In my retiring room I am by myself,” Jung said of the space. “I keep the key with me all the time; no one else is allowed in there except with my permission.”

在瑞士圣加仑（Swiss canton of St. Gallen），靠近苏黎世湖（Lake Zurich）北岸，有一个名为伯林根（Bollingen）的村庄。1922 年，心理学家卡尔·荣格（Carl Jung）选择在这里建起居所。最开始他建起一座简单的两层石头房子，将其称作“塔楼”。在一次印度之行中，他发现当地人有在家里开辟冥想屋的习俗，那次旅行之后，他便在自己住所中开辟了一座私人办公室。“在休息室时，我可以独处。”荣格这样评述这个房间，“我随时都带着钥匙；没有我的允许，任何人都不得进入这个房间。”

In his book Daily Rituals[^3], journalist Mason Currey sorted through various sources on Jung to re-create the psychiatrist’s work habits at the Tower. Jung would rise[^4] at seven a.m., Currey reports, and after a big breakfast he would spend two hours of undistracted writing time in his private office. His afternoons would often consist of meditation or long walks in the surrounding countryside. There was no electricity at the Tower, so as day gave way to night, light came from oil lamps and heat from the fireplace. Jung would retire to bed by ten p.m. “The feeling of repose[^5] and renewal[^6] that I had in this tower was intense from the start,” he said.

记者曼森·卡里（Mason Currey）在他的著作《每日仪式》（Daily Rituals）中整理了各种关于荣格的材料，重现了这位心理学家在塔楼中的工作习惯。卡里在书中写道，荣格会在早上 7 点起床，吃一顿丰盛的早餐，然后在私人办公室中度过两个小时不被人打扰的写作时间。下午，他通常会冥想或在周围的乡村长时间漫步。塔楼里没有电，因此日光暗去夜色朦胧之时，油灯为亮，壁炉送暖。荣格会在晚上 10 点上床休息。他说：“从一开始，我就感觉能够在这座塔楼里得到很好的休息和恢复。”

Though it’s tempting to think of Bollingen Tower as a vacation home, if we put it into the context of Jung’s career at this point it’s clear that the lakeside retreat was not built as an escape from work. In 1922, when Jung bought the property, he could not afford to take a vacation. Only one year earlier, in 1921, he had published Psychological Types, a seminal book that solidified many differences that had been long developing between Jung’s thinking and the ideas of his onetime friend and mentor, Sigmund Freud. To disagree with Freud in the 1920s was a bold move. To back up his book, Jung needed to stay sharp and produce a stream of smart articles and books further supporting and establishing analytical psychology, the eventual name for his new school of thought.

尽管我们很容易将伯林根塔楼看作度假屋，但是回顾荣格的职业生涯，人们会发现这座湖边居所显然并非为躲避工作而建。1922 年，荣格买下这片地产的时候还无暇度假。仅仅一年之前，在 1921 年，他发表了重要著作《心理类型》（Psychological Types），总结了长久以来荣格与其曾经的好友兼导师西格蒙德·弗洛伊德（Sigmund Freud）思想的诸多差异。在 20 世纪 20 年代，对弗洛伊德的思想提出质疑是很大胆的举动。想要支撑自己的著作，荣格需要保持清醒的状态，创作出一系列有见地的文章和著作，进一步支持和发展分析心理学（Analytical Psychology）。他后来也被称作分析心理学的创始人。

Jung’s lectures and counseling practice kept him busy in Zurich—this is clear. But he wasn’t satisfied with busyness alone. He wanted to change the way we understood the unconscious, and this goal required deeper, more careful thought than he could manage amid his hectic[^7] city lifestyle. Jung retreated[^1] to Bollingen, not to escape his professional life, but instead to advance it.

荣格在苏黎世期间开展演讲和心理咨询，一直很忙碌，这一点很明显。但是他并不满足于简单的忙碌生活。他想要改变我们对潜意识的认识，而这个目标需要更深入、更缜密的思考，这在忙碌的都市生活方式下是做不到的。所以荣格隐居到伯林根，并非逃离职业生活，而是为了职业生涯的发展。

Carl Jung went on to become one of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth century. There are, of course, many reasons for his eventual success. In this book, however, I’m interested in his commitment to the following skill, which almost certainly played a key role in his accomplishments:

卡尔·荣格后来发展为 20 世纪最具影响力的思想家之一。当然，他最终的成功背后有很多原因，但是在本书中，我的兴趣点会落在下述这项技能上，而这项技能显然对他的成就起到了至关重要的作用：

> Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
>
> 深度工作（Deep Work）：在无干扰的状态下专注进行职业活动，使个人的认知能力达到极限。这种努力能够创造新价值，提升技能，而且难以复制。

Deep work is necessary to wring every last drop of value out of your current intellectual capacity. We now know from decades of research in both psychology and neuroscience that the state of mental strain that accompanies deep work is also necessary to improve your abilities. Deep work, in other words, was exactly the type of effort needed to stand out in a cognitively demanding field like academic psychiatry in the early twentieth century.

深度工作是唤醒你当前智力水平下的每一点价值所必需的。经过心理学和神经科学方面的数十年研究，我们认识到伴随深度工作而来的精神紧张状态对于提升我们的能力也是必需的。换言之，想要在诸如 20 世纪初期学院精神病学等需要认知能力极高的领域鹤立鸡群，深度工作恰恰是我们所需要的。

The term “deep work” is my own and is not something Carl Jung would have used, but his actions during this period were those of someone who understood the underlying concept. Jung built a tower out of stone in the woods to promote deep work in his professional life—a task that required time, energy, and money. It also took him away from more immediate pursuits. As Mason Currey writes, Jung’s regular journeys to Bollingen reduced the time he spent on his clinical work, noting, “Although he had many patients who relied on him, Jung was not shy about taking time off.” Deep work, though a burden to prioritize, was crucial for his goal of changing the world.

“深度工作”的概念是我创造出来的，而非卡尔·荣格的说法，但是他在这段时间里的做法却像是理解其中深意。荣格在树林中用石头建起一座塔楼，以此实现职业生活中的深度工作——这项任务要求投入时间、精力和金钱。塔楼生活也使他抛开了短期利益。恰如曼森·卡里所写的，频繁移居伯林根的行为，减少了他的诊疗工作，但要注意：“尽管有很多病人依赖荣格诊疗，他还是不惜抽身离开。”尽管优先考虑深度工作是一种负担，但对于他改变世界的目标却是至关重要的。

Indeed, if you study the lives of other influential figures from both distant and recent history, you’ll find that a commitment to deep work is a common theme. The sixteenth-century essayist Michel de Montaigne, for example, prefigured Jung by working in a private library he built in the southern tower guarding the stone walls of his French château, while Mark Twain wrote much of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer in a shed on the property of the Quarry Farm in New York, where he was spending the summer. Twain’s study was so isolated from the main house that his family took to blowing a horn to attract his attention for meals.

其实，如果探究一番远近历史中其他重要人物的生活，你会发现深度工作在他们身上是非常普遍的。比如 16 世纪的散文家米歇尔·德·蒙田（Michel de Montaigne）早在荣格之前就在远离自己法国城堡石墙的南塔楼区建起了一座私人图书馆，而马克·吐温（Mark Twain）的《汤姆·索亚历险记》大部分都在纽约库阿里农场的一间小屋里完成，当时他在那里消夏。吐温的书房离主要房屋区太远，以至于他的家人要吹号吸引他的注意力，召唤他去吃饭。

Moving forward in history, consider the screenwriter and director Woody Allen. In the forty-four-year period between 1969 and 2013, Woody Allen wrote and directed forty-four films that received twenty-three Academy Award nominations—an absurd rate of artistic productivity. Throughout this period, Allen never owned a computer, instead completing all his writing, free from electronic distraction, on a German Olympia SM3 manual typewriter. Allen is joined in his rejection of computers by Peter Higgs, a theoretical physicist who performs his work in such disconnected isolation that journalists couldn’t find him after it was announced he had won the Nobel Prize. J.K. Rowling, on the other hand, does use a computer, but was famously absent from social media during the writing of her Harry Potter novels—even though this period coincided with the rise of the technology and its popularity among media figures. Rowling’s staff finally started a Twitter account in her name in the fall of 2009, as she was working on The Casual Vacancy, and for the first year and a half her only tweet read: “This is the real me, but you won’t be hearing from me often I am afraid, as pen and paper is my priority at the moment.”

历史再向前推移，就可以看到剧作家、导演伍迪·艾伦（Woody Allen）了。在 1969～2013 年这 44 年的时间里，伍迪·艾伦编写并导演了 44 部电影，获得 23 项奥斯卡奖提名——对于电影艺术作品而言，这个比例高得惊人。在这段时期里，艾伦一直没有电脑，所有写作都不受电子设备的干扰，而是在一台德国奥林匹亚 SM3 型号的手动打字机上完成。此外和艾伦一样拒绝使用电脑的还有理论物理学家彼得·希格斯（Peter Higgs），他在几乎与世隔绝的环境下工作，在他获得诺贝尔奖的消息传出后，记者都找不到他。J.K.·罗琳（J.K. Rowling）确实会使用电脑，但是广为人知的是，她在写作《哈利·波特》小说期间会远离社交媒体，尽管这段时间恰逢科技迅猛发展，公众人物也多对此趋之若鹜。罗琳手下的工作人员最终还是在 2009 年秋天用她的名字开设了推特账户，当时她正在写作《偶发空缺》（The Casual Vacancy），开设账户之后的头一年半里，她只发布了一条推特消息：“这是我的实名账户，但恐怕我不会经常发声，因为当前纸笔仍是我的最爱。”

Deep work, of course, is not limited to the historical or technophobic. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates famously conducted “Think Weeks” twice a year, during which he would isolate himself (often in a lakeside cottage) to do nothing but read and think big thoughts. It was during a 1995 Think Week that Gates wrote his famous “Internet Tidal Wave” memo that turned Microsoft’s attention to an upstart company called Netscape Communications. And in an ironic twist, Neal Stephenson, the acclaimed cyberpunk author who helped form our popular conception of the Internet age, is near impossible to reach electronically—his website offers no e-mail address and features an essay about why he is purposefully bad at using social media. Here’s how he once explained the omission: “If I organize my life in such a way that I get lots of long, consecutive, uninterrupted time-chunks, I can write novels. [If I instead get interrupted a lot] what replaces it? Instead of a novel that will be around for a long time… there is a bunch of e-mail messages that I have sent out to individual persons.”

当然，深度工作不仅仅局限于历史人物和厌恶电脑之人。众所周知，微软首席执行官比尔·盖茨每年都要进行两次“思考周”，在这段时间里，他会远离世事（通常是在湖边小屋），只读书，思考大局。正是在 1995 年的一次思考周中，盖茨写下了著名的“互联网浪潮”（Internet Tidal Wave）备忘录，将微软的注意力转移到一家名为网景通讯（Netscape Communications）的新兴公司。另外很具有讽刺性的是，被称作网络朋克作家的尼尔·斯蒂芬森（Neal Stephenson）参与创造了流行的网络时代概念，我们却几乎无法通过电子通讯的方式联络到他——他的个人网站上没有提供电子邮箱地址，还贴出一篇文章，解释自己故意不使用社交媒体的原因。下面一段话是他曾经对此的解释：“如果我如此安排生活，能够得到很长的、连续的、不受人打扰的时间，我就能写作小说。反之，如果我备受打扰又会怎样？不会有一部传世的小说……而是会有许多封发给个人的电子邮件。”

The ubiquity of deep work among influential individuals is important to emphasize because it stands in sharp contrast to the behavior of most modern knowledge workers—a group that’s rapidly forgetting the value of going deep.

在具有重大影响力的人物身上，深度工作的普遍存在现象很值得强调，因为这种现象与当代大多数知识工作者的行为形成了鲜明的对比，这个群体过快淡忘了深度工作的价值。

The reason knowledge workers are losing their familiarity with deep work is well established: network tools. This is a broad category that captures communication services like e-mail and SMS, social media networks like Twitter and Facebook, and the shiny tangle of infotainment sites like BuzzFeed and Reddit. In aggregate, the rise of these tools, combined with ubiquitous access to them through smartphones and networked office computers, has fragmented most knowledge workers’ attention into slivers. A 2012 McKinsey study found that the average knowledge worker now spends more than 60 percent of the workweek engaged in electronic communication and Internet searching, with close to 30 percent of a worker’s time dedicated to reading and answering e-mail alone.

知识工作者之所以远离深度工作，原因显而易见——网络工具。网络工具是一个非常广的门类，包括电子邮箱和短信等通讯服务、推特和脸谱网等社交网络，以及 BuzzFeed 和 Reddit 等炫酷的娱乐信息网站。这些工具的兴起，辅以智能手机和可联网办公电脑的广泛使用，将大多数知识工作者的注意力肢解得支离破碎。2012 年，麦肯锡的一项调研发现，知识工作者平均每周有超过 60% 的工作是进行电子沟通和网络搜索，其他工作者们则有将近 30% 的时间只是用于阅读和回复电子邮件。

This state of fragmented attention cannot accommodate deep work, which requires long periods of uninterrupted thinking. At the same time, however, modern knowledge workers are not loafing. In fact, they report that they are as busy as ever. What explains the discrepancy? A lot can be explained by another type of effort, which provides a counterpart to the idea of deep work:

这种注意力支离破碎的状态不可能带来深度工作，深度工作要求长时间无干扰的思考。然而与此同时，现代知识工作者也并没有游手好闲。事实上，他们称自己和以前一样忙碌。这种矛盾是由何产生的？另外一种类型的努力可以很好地解释个中原由，这种努力恰与深度工作的理念相悖：

> Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
>
> 浮浅工作（Shallow Work）：对认知要求不高的事务性任务，往往在受到干扰的情况下开展。此类工作通常不会为世界创造太多新价值，且容易复制。

In an age of network tools, in other words, knowledge workers increasingly replace deep work with the shallow alternative—constantly sending and receiving e-mail messages like human network routers, with frequent breaks for quick hits of distraction. Larger efforts that would be well served by deep thinking, such as forming a new business strategy or writing an important grant application, get fragmented into distracted dashes that produce muted quality. To make matters worse for depth, there’s increasing evidence that this shift toward the shallow is not a choice that can be easily reversed. Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work. “What the Net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation,” admitted journalist Nicholas Carr, in an oft-cited 2008 Atlantic article. “[And] I’m not the only one.” Carr expanded this argument into a book, The Shallows, which became a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. To write The Shallows, appropriately enough, Carr had to move to a cabin and forcibly disconnect.

换言之，在网络工具的时代，知识工作者越来越多地用浮浅工作——像人工网络路由器一样不断地收发电子邮件，不断被小事扰乱心神——替代了深度工作。诸如研究新的商务策略或撰写重要的经费申请报告等重大工作，本可很好地受益于深度思考，却也在受到干扰之后变得支离破碎，得不到很好的完成。

对深度工作更不利的是，越来越多的证据显示，向浮浅工作发展的趋势并不是很容易转变的。在极度浮浅的状态下度过足够的时间，将永久性降低自己深度工作的能力。“网络似乎剥夺了我专注和沉思的能力。”记者尼古拉斯·卡尔（Nicholas Carr）2008 年在《大西洋月刊》（Atlantic）上发表的一篇被广为引用的文章中坦言，“而且不只有我是这样。”卡尔由这个论点出发，写成了一本书，名为《浅薄：互联网如何毒化了我们的大脑》（The Shallows），后入围了普利策奖终选名单。为了写作《浅薄》一书，卡尔搬到一间小木屋里，强迫自己与世隔绝。

The idea that network tools are pushing our work from the deep toward the shallow is not new. The Shallows was just the first in a series of recent books to examine the Internet’s effect on our brains and work habits. These subsequent titles include William Powers’s Hamlet’s BlackBerry, John Freeman’s The Tyranny of E-mail, and Alex Soojung-Kin Pang’s The Distraction Addiction—all of which agree, more or less, that network tools are distracting us from work that requires unbroken concentration, while simultaneously degrading our capacity to remain focused.

网络工具促使我们从深度工作转向浮浅工作的观点并非新有。《浅薄》仅仅是近期一系列探究网络对我们大脑和工作习惯影响的书籍中最早的一部。后续的作品包括威廉·鲍尔斯（William Powers）的《哈姆雷特的黑莓》（Hamlet’s BlackBerry）、约翰·弗里曼（John Freeman）的《电邮的暴政》（The Tyranny of E-mail）和亚历克斯·索勇-金·庞（Alex Soojung-Kin Pang）的《分心成瘾》（The Distraction Addiction）——所有这些作品都或多或少地赞同网络工具使我们从必须专注完成的工作上分心，同时也降低了我们保持专注的能力。

Given this existing body of evidence, I will not spend more time in this book trying to establish this point. We can, I hope, stipulate that network tools negatively impact deep work. I’ll also sidestep any grand arguments about the long-term societal consequence of this shift, as such arguments tend to open impassible rifts. On one side of the debate are techno-skeptics like Jaron Lanier and John Freeman, who suspect that many of these tools, at least in their current state, damage society, while on the other side techno-optimists like Clive Thompson argue that they’re changing society, for sure, but in ways that’ll make us better off. Google, for example, might reduce our memory, but we no longer need good memories, as in the moment we can now search for anything we need to know.　　

鉴于现在已经有诸多证据，我在本书中不会再耗时证明此点。我希望我们能够认清网络工具对深度工作会产生负面影响。此外我还会回避此类转变所带来的长期社会影响等宏大的论题，因为此类论题往往会争辩无果。在这场论辩的一方是杰伦·拉尼尔（Jaron Lanier）和约翰·弗里曼等对科技持怀疑态度的人，他们认为很多此类工具至少在当前的状态下，会对社会造成损害。而另一方是克莱夫·汤普森（Clive Thompson）等对科技持乐观态度的人，他们认为这些工具当然会改变社会，但是会使我们的生活更好。比如谷歌或许会使我们的记忆力退化，但是因为我们此时能够搜索到任何想要知道的事情，所以不再需要好的记忆力。

I have no stance in this philosophical debate. My interest in this matter instead veers toward a thesis of much more pragmatic and individualized interest: Our work culture’s shift toward the shallow (whether you think it’s philosophically good or bad) is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing depth—an opportunity that, not too long ago, was leveraged by a bored young consultant from Virginia named Jason Benn.

我在这场哲学论辩中并不站在任何一方。我在此话题上的兴趣在于一种更实际和关乎个人利益的主题：向浮浅工作转变的工作文化（不管你认为从哲学意义上讲是好还是坏）使少数能够抵抗此种潮流、优先考虑深度工作的人享有极大的经济前景和个人发展机会。不久之前，来自弗吉尼亚的一个名为杰森·本（JasonBenn）的无聊年轻人就充分利用了这种机会。

There are many ways to discover that you’re not valuable in our economy. For Jason Benn the lesson was made clear when he realized, not long after taking a job as a financial consultant, that the vast majority of his work responsibilities could be automated by a “kludged together” Excel script.

人们经常会发现自己在大家的经济生活中并没有价值。杰森·本在开始一份金融咨询的工作后不久就认识到了这一点，他发现自己工作的绝大部分职责都可以靠一份 Excel 脚本自动“拼凑到一起”。

The firm that hired Benn produced reports for banks involved in complex deals. (“It was about as interesting as it sounds,” Benn joked in one of our interviews.) The report creation process required hours of manual manipulation of data in a series of Excel spreadsheets. When he first arrived, it took Benn up to six hours per report to finish this stage (the most efficient veterans at the firm could complete this task in around half the time). This didn’t sit well with Benn.

雇佣本的那家公司为涉及复杂交易的银行制作报告。（“这份工作很有趣，和听起来一样。”本在我们的一次采访中开玩笑说。）制作报告的过程需要花费数小时的时间，手动将数据输入到多张 Excel 表格中。刚入职时，本需要用上 6 个小时才能完成一份报告的表格填写（公司里最熟练的老员工则需要半小时左右的时间）。本不太能接受这样的状况。

“The way it was taught to me, the process seemed clunky and manually intensive,” Benn recalls. He knew that Excel has a feature called macros that allows users to automate common tasks. Benn read articles on the topic and soon put together a new worksheet, wired up with a series of these macros that could take the six-hour process of manual data manipulation and replace it, essentially, with a button click. A report-writing process that originally took him a full workday could now be reduced to less than an hour.

“公司教我的办法很笨拙，需要大量的手动劳动。”本回忆说。他知道 Excel 有一项叫作宏的功能，使用者可利用这项功能自动完成同类任务。本阅读了相关的文章，很快就制作出一张新的电子数据表，其中包含一些此类的宏，可以取代 6 小时的手动数据输入过程，基本只需点击一下便可完成。写作报告的过程本来要耗费他一个工作日的时间，现在只需不到半小时的时间。

Benn is a smart guy. He graduated from an elite college (the University of Virginia) with a degree in economics, and like many in his situation he had ambitions for his career. It didn’t take him long to realize that these ambitions would be thwarted so long as his main professional skills could be captured in an Excel macro. He decided, therefore, he needed to increase his value to the world. After a period of research, Benn reached a conclusion: He would, he declared to his family, quit his job as a human spreadsheet and become a computer programmer. As is often the case with such grand plans, however, there was a hitch: Jason Benn had no idea how to write code.

本是个很聪明的人。他毕业于名牌大学（弗吉尼亚大学），获得经济学学位，和很多与他相似的人一样，他对自己的职业生涯雄心勃勃。没过多久他就意识到，如果自己主要的职业技能可以通过一个 Excel 宏解决，那么这些雄心壮志终会遭遇挫败。因此他决定，需要提升自己对这个世界的价值。经过一番研究，本得到一个结论：他向家人宣称，他将辞去人工电子数据表制作员的工作，成为一名程序员。然而，此类宏大的计划背后往往有一点漏洞：杰森·本根本不知道如何写代码。

As a computer scientist I can confirm an obvious point: Programming computers is hard. Most new developers dedicate a four-year college education to learning the ropes before their first job—and even then, competition for the best spots is fierce. Jason Benn didn’t have this time. After his Excel epiphany, he quit his job at the financial firm and moved home to prepare for his next step. His parents were happy he had a plan, but they weren’t happy about the idea that this return home might be long-term. Benn needed to learn a hard skill, and needed to do so fast.

作为一名计算机科学家，我可以确认显而易见的一点：计算机编程很难。大多数开发人员要经过 4 年的大学教育才能了解这个行业，开始第一份工作。而即便如此，想要得到最好的位置仍然需要面临激烈的竞争。杰森·本没有这样的时间。在那次关于 Excel 的顿悟之后，他辞去金融公司的工作，回家准备下一步工作。他的父母对他的计划很高兴，但是并不喜欢他在家里长期住下。本需要学会一项很难的技能，而且需要快速完成。

It’s here that Benn ran into the same problem that holds back many knowledge workers from navigating into more explosive career trajectories. Learning something complex like computer programming requires intense uninterrupted concentration on cognitively demanding concepts—the type of concentration that drove Carl Jung to the woods surrounding Lake Zurich. This task, in other words, is an act of deep work. Most knowledge workers, however, as I argued earlier in this introduction, have lost their ability to perform deep work. Benn was no exception to this trend.

到此时，本遭遇了跟很多知识工作者同样的问题，无法在职业轨迹上有爆发式上升。学习电脑编程之类非常复杂的知识需要持续地专注于需要高认知度的任务——恰如驱使卡尔·荣格置身于苏黎世湖边的树林中的那种专注一般。换言之，这项任务是一种深度工作。然而，如我在之前所述，大多数知识工作者已经失去了深度工作的能力。本在这种潮流中也非例外。

“I was always getting on the Internet and checking my e-mail; I couldn’t stop myself; it was a compulsion,” Benn said, describing himself during the period leading up to his quitting his finance job. To emphasize his difficulty with depth, Benn told me about a project that a supervisor at the finance firm once brought to him. “They wanted me to write a business plan,” he explained. Benn didn’t know how to write a business plan, so he decided he would find and read five different existing plans—comparing and contrasting them to understand what was needed. This was a good idea, but Benn had a problem: “I couldn’t stay focused.” There were days during this period, he now admits, when he spent almost every minute (“98 percent of my time”) surfing the Web. The business plan project—a chance to distinguish himself early in his career—fell to the wayside.

“我总是不停地上网，查看电邮；我根本停不下来，好似一种强迫症。”本讲述辞去金融工作之前那一段时间里自己的状态。为了强调自己深度工作的困难，本向我讲述了金融公司的上司让他完成的一个项目。“他们想要我写一份商业计划，”他解释说。本不知道如何写商业计划，于是决定先搜索并阅读 5 篇不同的现有计划，然后通过对比和比较，理清需要哪些内容。这是个好主意，但是本遇到一个问题：“我无法专注。”他现在承认，在这段时间里，有好多天几乎每一分钟（“98% 的时间”）都在上网。而商业计划项目，这个可以使他在职业生涯早期脱颖而出的机会，却被丢到了一旁。

By the time he quit, Benn was well aware of his difficulties with deep work, so when he dedicated himself to learning how to code, he knew he had to simultaneously teach his mind how to go deep. His method was drastic but effective. “I locked myself in a room with no computer: just textbooks, notecards, and a highlighter.” He would highlight the computer programming textbooks, transfer the ideas to notecards, and then practice them out loud. These periods free from electronic distraction were hard at first, but Benn gave himself no other option: He had to learn this material, and he made sure there was nothing in that room to distract him. Over time, however, he got better at concentrating, eventually getting to a point where he was regularly clocking five or more disconnected hours per day in the room, focused without distraction on learning this hard new skill. “I probably read something like eighteen books on the topic by the time I was done,” he recalls.

辞职的时候，本已经很了解自己很难做到深度工作，因此当他决定学习编程的时候，他知道自己同时还要教会自己的大脑如何深入下去。他的方法很极端，却很有效。“我把自己锁到一间没有电脑的房间里：只有课本、笔记卡片和荧光笔。”他会在电脑编程课本上做标记，将学到的关键点记录到笔记卡片上，然后大声读出来练习。最初远离电子设备的日子很难熬，但本强迫自己坚持下去：他必须学会这些材料，要确保屋子里没有使他分心的东西。然而，随着时间的推移，他保持专注的能力逐渐增强，到后来经常能够每天在那个房间里与外界隔绝 5 个小时甚至更久，不分心地专注学习这些艰涩的新技能。“到最后我大约读了 18 本相关的书。”他回忆道。

After two months locked away studying, Benn attended the notoriously difficult Dev Bootcamp: a hundred-hour-a-week crash course in Web application programming. (While researching the program, Benn found a student with a PhD from Princeton who had described Dev as “the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.”) Given both his preparation and his newly honed ability for deep work, Benn excelled. “Some people show up not prepared,” he said. “They can’t focus. They can’t learn quickly.” Only half the students who started the program with Benn ended up graduating on time. Benn not only graduated, but was also the top student in his class.

两个月的封闭学习后，本参加了难度很高的开发人员训练营（Dev Bootcamp）：一周 100 小时的网络应用程序短训班。（在搜索该项目相关信息时，本发现一名来自普林斯顿大学的博士生将 Dev 描述为“我这辈子做过的最难的事情”。）有了充分的准备和新打磨的深度工作能力，本表现得极为出色。“有些人没有做好准备。”他说，“他们不能做到专注。他们不能迅速学习。”与本一同参加这个短训班项目的学生中只有一半按时毕业。本不仅毕业了，而且还是班上成绩顶尖的学生。

The deep work paid off. Benn quickly landed a job as a developer at a San Francisco tech start-up with \$25 million in venture funding and its pick of employees. When Benn quit his job as a financial consultant, only half a year earlier, he was making \$40,000 a year. His new job as a computer developer paid \$100,000—an amount that can continue to grow, essentially without limit in the Silicon Valley market, along with his skill level.

When I last spoke with Benn, he was thriving in his new position. A newfound devotee of deep work, he rented an apartment across the street from his office, allowing him to show up early in the morning before anyone else arrived and work without distraction. “On good days, I can get in four hours of focus before the first meeting,” he told me. “Then maybe another three to four hours in the afternoon. And I do mean ‘focus’: no e-mail, no Hacker News [a website popular among tech types], just programming.” For someone who admitted to sometimes spending up to 98 percent of his day in his old job surfing the Web, Jason Benn’s transformation is nothing short of astonishing.

深度工作有了成效。本很快就在旧金山一家科技创业公司找到了一份开发员的工作，这家公司拿到了 2500 万美元的风险投资。一年半之前，本辞去金融咨询的工作时，他一年收入为 4 万美元，电脑程序员的新工作则可以拿到 10 万美元。随着技能水平的提高，这个数字还可以持续增长，在硅谷市场上几乎没有上限。我最后一次和本交谈时，他已经在新岗位上做得有声有色。他成为深度工作的新拥趸，在办公室对面的街上找到一套公寓，这样早晨就能在其他人到来之前很早来到办公室，毫无干扰地工作。“运气好的时候，一天第一次会议之前，我能有四个小时无人打扰的工作时间。”他告诉我，“然后下午或许还能有三四个小时。而且我说的是真正的‘专注’：没有电子邮件，没有黑客新闻（Hacker News，在电脑技术人员中非常流行的网站），只做编程。”对于一个承认过去工作中有时 98% 的时间都用来上网的人来说，杰森·本的转变着实令人震惊。

Jason Benn’s story highlights a crucial lesson: Deep work is not some nostalgic affectation of writers and early-twentieth-century philosophers. It’s instead a skill that has great value today.

杰森·本的故事突出了一点关键的经验：深度工作并非某种矫揉造作的怀旧情绪，也不是作家和 20 世纪早期哲学家独有的，而是在当今社会也很有价值的一种技能。

There are two reasons for this value. The first has to do with learning. We have an information economy that’s dependent on complex systems that change rapidly. Some of the computer languages Benn learned, for example, didn’t exist ten years ago and will likely be outdated ten years from now. Similarly, someone coming up in the field of marketing in the 1990s probably had no idea that today they’d need to master digital analytics. To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don’t cultivate this ability, you’re likely to fall behind as technology advances.

它之所以有价值，有两方面原因。第一种原因与学习相关。我们生活在信息经济时代，依赖于迅速更新的复杂体系。比如，本学过的一些电脑语言在 10 年前是不存在的，而且很可能再过 10 年也会过时。与之类似地，20 世纪 90 年代加入营销队伍的人或许根本不会想到今天需要掌握数字分析的能力。因此，想要在社会经济中保持价值，就必须掌握快速学习复杂技能的艺术。这项任务要求深度工作。如果你不培养这项能力，就很可能随着技术的更新而被淘汰。

The second reason that deep work is valuable is because the impacts of the digital network revolution cut both ways. If you can create something useful, its reachable audience (e.g., employers or customers) is essentially limitless—which greatly magnifies your reward. On the other hand, if what you’re producing is mediocre, then you’re in trouble, as it’s too easy for your audience to find a better alternative online. Whether you’re a computer programmer, writer, marketer, consultant, or entrepreneur, your situation has become similar to Jung trying to outwit Freud, or Jason Benn trying to hold his own in a hot start-up: To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you’re capable of producing—a task that requires depth.

深度学习有其价值的第二种原因是数字网络革命的影响力是双向的。如果你能创造出有用的东西，它的受众（比如雇主或用户）就可能是无限的，从而极大提升你所获的奖励。另一方面，如果产出的东西中规中矩，你就会陷入困难，因为你的受众很容易在网上找到更好的替代品。不论你是一名电脑程序员、作家、市场营销人员、咨询师还是企业家，你的处境都和想要超越弗洛伊德的荣格一样，又或是与想要在创业新贵公司中维持地位的杰森·本相似：想要成功，你就必须产出自己能力范围内最好的产品，而这项任务需要深度。

The growing necessity of deep work is new. In an industrial economy, there was a small skilled labor and professional class for which deep work was crucial, but most workers could do just fine without ever cultivating an ability to concentrate without distraction. They were paid to crank widgets—and not much about their job would change in the decades they kept it. But as we shift to an information economy, more and more of our population are knowledge workers, and deep work is becoming a key currency—even if most haven’t yet recognized this reality.

深度工作的必要性正在不断增长，这种趋势是新近出现的。在工业经济时代，只有小部分技术工人和专业人士需要深度工作，但是大多数工人不培养无干扰专注的能力也无大碍。他们靠做一些小玩意拿工资，他们所做的工作在数十年的时间里都不会有什么变化。但是随着信息经济时代的到来，越来越多的人成为知识工作者，深度工作就成为核心货币，虽然大多数人并没有意识到这个现实。

Deep work is not, in other words, an old-fashioned skill falling into irrelevance. It’s instead a crucial ability for anyone looking to move ahead in a globally competitive information economy that tends to chew up and spit out those who aren’t earning their keep. The real rewards are reserved not for those who are comfortable using Facebook (a shallow task, easily replicated), but instead for those who are comfortable building the innovative distributed systems that run the service (a decidedly deep task, hard to replicate). Deep work is so important that we might consider it, to use the phrasing of business writer Eric Barker, “the superpower of the 21st century.”

换言之，深度工作并非一种无用的传统技能，而是任何想要在竞争激烈的全球化信息经济时代——无法跟随时代潮流发展的人将被这个时代生吞活剥——立足的人都应该掌握的核心技能。真正的奖励不会留给那些熟练使用脸谱网的人（这是一项浮浅任务，很容易复制），而是留给那些能够构建创新的分散式体系，使这项服务能够运转的人（毫无疑问是一种深度任务，很难复制）。深度工作非常重要，我们或许应该用商业作家埃里克·巴克（Eric Barker）的说法，将其称作“21 世纪的超级力量”。

We have now seen two strands of thought—one about the increasing scarcity of deep work and the other about its increasing value—which we can combine into the idea that provides the foundation for everything that follows in this book:

我们已经探究过两条思路，一种是深度工作的日益稀少，另一种是其日益提升的价值。可以将二者结合成一种理念，这种理念为本书的一切内容提供了基础：

> The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.
>
> 深度工作假设（The Deep Work Hypothesis）：深度工作的能力日益稀少，而几乎同时，其在社会经济中的价值也日益提升。因此，能够培养这项技能，并将其内化为工作生活之核心的人，将会取得成功。

This book has two goals, pursued in two parts. The first, tackled in Part 1, is to convince you that the deep work hypothesis is true. The second, tackled in Part 2, is to teach you how to take advantage of this reality by training your brain and transforming your work habits to place deep work at the core of your professional life. Before diving into these details, however, I’ll take a moment to explain how I became such a devotee of depth.

本书有两个目标，分两部分进行阐述。第一个目标在第一部分实现，旨在让你相信深度工作假设的真实性。第二个目标在第二部分实现，旨在教会你如何利用这个机会，训练你的大脑，转变你的工作习惯，使其成为你的职业生活的核心。然而，在深入探究这些细节之前，我要花点时间解释一下我是如何成为深度工作拥趸的。

I’ve spent the past decade cultivating my own ability to concentrate on hard things. To understand the origins of this interest, it helps to know that I’m a theoretical computer scientist who performed my doctoral training in MIT’s famed[^8] Theory of Computation group—a professional setting where the ability to focus is considered a crucial occupational skill.

我用过去 10 年的时间培养了自己专注于难题的能力。想要理解这种兴趣的起源，有一点或许会有所帮助。我是一名理论计算机科学家，在举世闻名的麻省理工计算理论小组（Theory of Computation Group）完成了博士学业，而在计算理论小组中，保持专注是关键的职业技能。

During these years, I shared a graduate student office down the hall from a MacArthur “genius grant” winner—a professor who was hired at MIT before he was old enough to legally drink. It wasn’t uncommon to find this theoretician sitting in the common space, staring at markings on a whiteboard, with a group of visiting scholars arrayed[^9] around him, also sitting quietly and staring. This could go on for hours. I’d go to lunch; I’d come back—still staring. This particular professor is hard to reach. He’s not on Twitter and if he doesn’t know you, he’s unlikely to respond to your e-mail. Last year he published sixteen papers.

这些年里，我所在的研究生办公室恰在一名麦克阿瑟天才奖（MacArthur“Genius Grant”）获得者办公室的走廊尽头，这个人在还没到法定喝酒的年龄就被麻省理工大学聘为教授。这位理论学者经常会坐在公共区域，盯着白板上的标记看，四周围坐着一群访问学者，也安静地坐在那里，盯着白板看。这个过程可以持续几个小时。我去吃午饭，吃完午饭回来，他们还在盯着看。这位教授的踪迹很难寻到。他不上推特，如果他不认识你，一般也不会回你的电子邮件。去年他发表了 16 篇论文。

This type of fierce concentration permeated[^10] the atmosphere during my student years. Not surprisingly, I soon developed a similar commitment to depth. To the chagrin[^11] of both my friends and the various publicists I’ve worked with on my books, I’ve never had a Facebook or Twitter account, or any other social media presence outside of a blog. I don’t Web surf and get most of my news from my home-delivered Washington Post and NPR. I’m also generally hard to reach: My author website doesn’t provide a personal e-mail address, and I didn’t own my first smartphone until 2012 (when my pregnant wife gave me an ultimatum[^12]—“you have to have a phone that works before our son is born”).

在我当学生的那几年里，周围一直弥漫着这种极度专注的氛围。毫不奇怪，我也很快培养出类似的深度专注能力。令我的朋友和诸多合作出书的出版商懊恼的是，我从来没有脸谱网或推特账户，除了博客之外未曾用过任何其他社交媒体。我不上网，新闻多从送到家里的《华盛顿邮报》（Washington Post）和美国国家公共电台（NPR，National Public Radio）获取。另外想要找到我的人也很难如愿：我的作者网站里没有提供私人电子邮箱地址，而且直到 2012 年我才有了第一部智能手机。（我怀孕的妻子给我下了最后通牒：“儿子出生之前，你一定要买一部可以用的手机。”）

On the other hand, my commitment to depth has rewarded me. In the ten-year period following my college graduation, I published four books, earned a PhD, wrote peer-reviewed academic papers at a high rate, and was hired as a tenure-track professor at Georgetown University. I maintained this voluminous[^13] production while rarely working past five or six p.m. during the workweek.

另一方面，我对深度工作的执着也得到了回报。大学毕业之后 10 年的时间里，我出版了 4 本书，获得了一个博士学位，发表同行评审学术文章的频率也很高，还受聘于乔治城大学（Georgetown University），成为终身教授。虽然有这么多的成就，但我在工作日很少会工作到下午五六点钟。

This compressed schedule is possible because I’ve invested significant effort to minimize the shallow in my life while making sure I get the most out of the time this frees up. I build my days around a core of carefully chosen deep work, with the shallow activities I absolutely cannot avoid batched[^14] into smaller bursts[^15] at the peripheries[^16] of my schedule. Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.

我之所以能将工作压缩到如此短的时间内，是因为我投入了巨大的精力，竭力精简生活中浮浅的内容，同时确保充分利用由此节省的时间。我每天的工作都围绕着精心挑选的深度工作展开，确实无法避免的浮浅活动则拆分成小块，在日程的间隙完成。每天三四个小时，每周五天没有任何打扰、精心安排的专注工作，带来了很多极有价值的产出。

My commitment to depth has also returned nonprofessional benefits. For the most part, I don’t touch a computer between the time when I get home from work and the next morning when the new workday begins (the main exception being blog posts, which I like to write after my kids go to bed). This ability to fully disconnect, as opposed to the more standard practice of sneaking[^17] in a few quick work e-mail checks, or giving in to frequent surveys of social media sites, allows me to be present with my wife and two sons in the evenings, and read a surprising number of books for a busy father of two. More generally, the lack of distraction in my life tones[^18] down that background hum[^19] of nervous mental energy that seems to increasingly pervade people’s daily lives. I’m comfortable being bored, and this can be a surprisingly rewarding skill—especially on a lazy D.C. summer night listening to a Nationals game slowly unfold[^20] on the radio.

我对深度工作的投入在职业之外也带来了益处。从我下班回家至第二天早晨新工作日开始的这段时间，我几乎不碰电脑（只有写博客这个例外，我喜欢在孩子上床睡觉之后写写博客）。这种全然与世隔绝的能力，与隔一会查看一下工作邮件或频繁查阅社交网站等更惯常的做法相对，使我能够在晚上与妻子和两个儿子相伴，虽然是两个孩子的父亲，很忙碌，但还是能阅读数量惊人的书籍。更宽泛一点讲，远离生活中的干扰，缓和了似乎在日益侵蚀人们日常生活的紧张心智能量。我觉得无聊是很舒适的，它是一项可以转化出丰厚回报的技能，特别是在慵懒的华盛顿特区的夏日夜晚，听着电台直播华盛顿国民队的比赛的时候。

This book is best described as an attempt to formalize and explain my attraction to depth over shallowness, and to detail the types of strategies that have helped me act on this attraction. I’ve committed this thinking to words, in part, to help you follow my lead in rebuilding your life around deep work—but this isn’t the whole story. My other interest in distilling and clarifying these thoughts is to further develop my own practice. My recognition of the deep work hypothesis has helped me thrive, but I’m convinced that I haven’t yet reached my full value-producing potential. As you struggle and ultimately triumph[^21] with the ideas and rules in the chapters ahead, you can be assured that I’m following suit[^22]—ruthlessly culling[^23] the shallow and painstakingly cultivating the intensity of my depth. (You’ll learn how I fare[^24] in this book’s conclusion.)

对本书最恰当的描述莫过于尝试规范和解释我为何偏爱深度而非浮浅，并细化帮助我将之付诸实践的策略种类。我将这些想法诉诸文字，有一部分原因在于引导你们围绕深度工作重塑生活，但这并非全部目的。我之所以要解构和阐释这些想法的另一个原因，在于进一步提升我自己的实践水平。对深度工作假设的接纳帮我取得了成功，但是我坚信自己还没有充分开发全部的潜能。当你按照本书的观念和规则辛苦努力并最终取得成功时，请相信我也在按同样的方法前进——毫不留情地砍掉浮浅的内容，不遗余力地强化深度。（在本书的结论中，你将看到我的努力成果。）

When Carl Jung wanted to revolutionize the field of psychiatry, he built a retreat in the woods. Jung’s Bollingen Tower became a place where he could maintain his ability to think deeply and then apply the skill to produce work of such stunning originality that it changed the world. In the pages ahead, I’ll try to convince you to join me in the effort to build our own personal Bollingen Towers; to cultivate an ability to produce real value in an increasingly distracted world; and to recognize a truth embraced by the most productive and important personalities of generations past: A deep life is a good life.

卡尔·荣格想要实现心理学的变革时，他在树林中建起一处隐居所。荣格的伯林根塔楼为他提供了保持深度思考的场所，他在这里将技能加以应用，产出了具有惊人独创性的成果，以至改变了世界。在后文中，我将努力说服你们加入我，共同努力构建我们自己的伯林根塔楼；培养在日益浮躁的世界里创造真实价值的能力；认识到数代人中最富有成效和举足轻重的人物所认可的真理——深度的生活才是优质生活。
