# Rule #2: Embrace Boredom

To better understand how one masters the art of deep work, I suggest visiting the Knesses Yisroel Synagogue in Spring Valley, New York, at six a.m. on a weekday morning. If you do, you’ll likely find at least twenty cars in the parking lot. Inside, you’ll encounter a couple dozen members of the congregation working over texts—some might be reading silently, mouthing the words of an ancient language, while others are paired together debating. At one end of the room a rabbi will be leading a larger group in a discussion. This early morning gathering in Spring Valley represents just a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of orthodox Jews who will wake up early that morning, as they do every weekday morning, to practice a central tenet of their faith: to spend time every day studying the complex written traditions of Rabbinic Judaism.

为了更好地理解如何深度工作，我建议你在某个工作日的早上 6 点去拜访纽约春谷（Spring Valley）的犹太社团教堂。到达之后，你将会遇到二十几个人的集会，他们在研究经文——一些人可能在静静地读，默念一门古代语言的单词；另外一些人可能正凑在一起辩论。房间的尽头，一位拉比正在主持一个大型的讨论会。春谷的这个清早集会只是一个缩影。几十万的正统犹太人会在那一个清早集会，正如他们每个清早做的那样，去实践他们信仰的核心信条：每天都拿出时间来研究希伯来犹太族复杂的书写传统。

I was introduced to this world by Adam Marlin, a member of the Knesses Yisroel congregation and one of the regulars at its morning study group. As Marlin explained to me, his goal with this practice is to decipher one Talmud page each day (though he sometimes fails to make it even this far), often working with a *chevruta* (study partner) to push his understanding closer to his cognitive limit.

把我引荐到这个圈子里的人是亚当·马林（Adam Marlin）。他是犹太社团集会的成员，也是这个早晨学习组的常客。马林告诉我，他参加清早学习组的目标是每天解读一页《塔木德》（Talmud）（尽管到现在，他有时候还是做不到），他有一个共同学习的伙伴（Chevruta）来帮助自己把学习能力推向认知极限。

What interests me about Marlin is not his knowledge of ancient texts, but instead the type of effort required to gain this knowledge. When I interviewed him, he emphasized the mental intensity of his morning ritual. “It’s an extreme and serious discipline, consisting mostly of the ‘deep work’ stuff [you write about],” he explained. “I run a growing business, but this is often the hardest brain strain I do.” This strain is not unique to Marlin but is instead ingrained in the practice—as his rabbi once explained to him: “You cannot consider yourself as fulfilling this daily obligation unless you have stretched to the reaches of your mental capacity.”

让我感兴趣的不是马林在古经文方面的知识，而是一个人获得这些知识所需要付出的努力。当我采访他的时候，他着重强调了这个清早仪式所要求的心智强度。“这是一种极度严格的训练，需要很多（你所写的）‘深度工作’之类的东西。”他解释说，“虽然我正在经营一桩处于上升期的生意，但是这个训练反而经常成为我所承受的最大心智挑战。”这种挑战并非只有马林一人要面对，而是贯穿于这整个学习活动中，正如他的拉比向他解释的：“如果某一天没有挑战自己的心智极限，那么你就不能说已经完成了这一天的任务。”

Unlike many orthodox Jews, Marlin came late to his faith, not starting his rigorous Talmud training until his twenties. This bit of trivia proves useful to our purposes because it allows Marlin a clear before-and-after comparison concerning the impact of these mental calisthenics—and the result surprised him. Though Marlin was exceptionally well educated when he began the practice—he holds *three different* Ivy League degrees—he soon met fellow adherents who had only ever attended small religious schools but could still “dance intellectual circles” around him. “A number of these people are highly successful [professionally],” he explained to me, “but it wasn’t some fancy school that pushed their intellect higher; it became clear it was instead their daily study that started as early as the fifth grade.”

不同于许多其他的正统犹太人，马林皈依得比较晚，他直到 20 多岁才开始接受严格的塔木德训练。这个细节反而有助于我们的研究，因为我们可以清楚地得知马林在采用这种心智练习之前和之后的区别——这个区别着实令他大吃一惊。虽然马林在参加这种学习之前就已经接受了非常好的教育——有三个不同的常春藤盟校学位，他马上就发现和他一起学习的人中有些只念过小型宗教学校，但仍可以在他身边“绕圈讲经”。“这些人中的许多人是在职业上十分成功的，”他向我解释道，“但并不是一些好学校帮助他们提高了智商，很明显是他们从小学五年级就开始的日常学习帮助了他们。”

After a while, Marlin began to notice positive changes in his own ability to think deeply. “I’ve recently been making more highly creative insights in my business life,” he told me. “I’m convinced it’s related to this daily mental practice. This consistent strain has built my mental muscle over years and years. This was not the goal when I started, but it is the effect.”

一段时间后，马林开始注意到自己的深度思考能力得到了明显的改善。他告诉我：“最近在打理生意时，我发现自己有了更深刻、更有创造性的理解力。我确信这与我日常的心智练习有关。年复一年持续的挑战增强了我的心智力量。这并不是一开始我追求的目标，但却得到了这样的结果。”

Adam Marlin’s experience underscores an important reality about deep work: The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained. This idea might sound obvious once it’s pointed out, but it represents a departure from how most people understand such matters. In my experience, it’s common to treat undistracted concentration as a *habit* like flossing—something that you know how to do and know is good for you, but that you’ve been neglecting due to a lack of motivation. This mind-set is appealing because it implies you can transform your working life from distracted to focused overnight if you can simply muster enough motivation. But this understanding ignores the difficulty of focus and the hours of practice necessary to strengthen your “mental muscle.” The creative insights that Adam Marlin now experiences in his professional life, in other words, have little to do with a onetime decision to think deeper, and much to do with a commitment to training this ability early every morning.

亚当·马林的经历说明了一个关于深度工作的重要事实：高度集中注意力的能力是一种需要训练的技能。个中道理一点就透，但是实践中大部分人对注意力的理解却与此相左。在以前的经历里，我把不被打扰的集中注意力当成是一种类似于使用牙线的习惯——你知道如何去做，也知道它对你有益，但是因为缺少动力，你经常会忽视它。这种定式思维十分流行。它暗示：只要你获得足够的动力，就可以瞬间转变自己散乱的工作生活，变得专注起来。然而，这种想法忽视了做到专注的难度，忽视了增强“心智力量”需要一定时间的练习。换句话来说，亚当·马林现在职业生活中所拥有的创造性理解力与他决定进行深度思考的那一刻几乎没有关系，而主要源自每一个清晨都训练这方面能力的努力。

There is, however, an important corollary to this idea: Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don’t simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction. Much in the same way that athletes must take care of their bodies outside of their training sessions, you’ll struggle to achieve the deepest levels of concentration if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom.

关于这个理念，我们还可以得出一个重要推论：如果你不同时减少对分心事物的依赖，增强专注度的努力可能就会白费。就如同运动员在训练时段之外也要照顾好自己的身体一样，如果在自己其余的时间里有一点无聊，你就打发时间，那么你将很难实现最大程度的专注。

We can find evidence for this claim in the research of Clifford Nass, the late Stanford communications professor who was well known for his study of behavior in the digital age. Among other insights, Nass’s research revealed that constant attention switching online has a lasting negative effect on your brain. Here’s Nass summarizing these findings in a 2010 interview with NPR’s Ira Flatow:

我们可以从克利福德·纳斯（Clifford Nass）的研究中找到证明这一推论的证据。这位斯坦福大学通讯学的新晋博士因自己对于数字时代人类行为的研究而闻名于世。他有一种见解，认为在网上不断地切换注意力会对大脑产生长久的负面影响。2010 年接受美国国家公共电台（NPR）的伊拉·福莱特（Ira Flatow）采访时，纳斯对自己的发现做出如下总结：

> *So we have scales that allow us to divide up people into people who multitask all the time and people who rarely do, and the differences are remarkable. People who multitask all the time can’t filter out irrelevancy. They can’t manage a working memory. They’re chronically distracted. They initiate much larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand… they’re pretty much mental wrecks.*
>
> 我们用一系列标准把人群区分为一直进行多任务工作的人和很少进行多任务工作的人两种。这两者之间的差异是很明显的。一直进行多任务工作的人不能过滤掉无关的事务。他们无法维持一个关于工作的记忆。他们的注意力是长期分散的。他们会启用更多的与当前任务无关的大脑功能……他们基本上就是心智残疾的。

At this point Flatow asks Nass whether the chronically distracted recognize this rewiring of their brain:

在此时，福莱特问纳斯这种长期注意力分散的人是否注意到了他们大脑的改变：

> *The people we talk with continually said, “look, when I really have to concentrate, I turn off everything and I am laser-focused.”* And unfortunately, they’ve developed habits of mind that make it impossible for them to be laser-focused. *They’re suckers for irrelevancy. They just can’t keep on task.* [emphasis mine]
>
> 我们做过交流的人总是说：“瞧，当我真正需要专注的时候，我屏蔽掉所有的事情，然后可以像激光一样专注。”不幸的是，他们业已养成的习惯使他们不能像激光一样专注。他们是无关事务的牺牲品。他们就是不能将任务持续下去。

Once your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction, Nass discovered, it’s hard to shake the addiction even when you *want* to concentrate. To put this more concretely: If every moment of potential boredom in your life—say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research, it’s not ready for deep work—even if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration.

纳斯发现：一旦你的大脑习惯了随时分心，即使在你想要专注的时候，也很难摆脱这种积习。更具体地说：如果你生活中潜在的每一刻无聊时光——比如说，需要排队等 5 分钟或者是在餐厅坐等朋友——都是用浏览智能手机来打发，那么你的大脑就可能已经被重新编排，从某种程度上说，就像是纳斯研究所里说的“心智残疾”。这时你的大脑已经不能够胜任深度工作，即使你也会经常安排时间来训练专注的能力。

Rule #1 taught you how to integrate deep work into your schedule and support it with routines and rituals designed to help you consistently reach the current limit of your concentration ability. Rule #2 will help you significantly improve this limit. The strategies that follow are motivated by the key idea that getting the most out of your deep work habit requires training, and as clarified previously, this training must address two goals: improving your ability to concentrate intensely *and* overcoming your desire for distraction. These strategies cover a variety of approaches, from quarantining distraction to mastering a special form of meditation, that combine to provide a practical road map for your journey from a mind wrecked by constant distraction and unfamiliar with concentration, to an instrument that truly does deliver laser-like focus.

准则 1 教你怎么样把深度工作安排到日程里，用日常惯例和习惯来帮助你不断达到当前精力集中程度的上限。准则 2 将帮助你大大提高这一上限。接下来的策略正是基于一个关键理念：最大程度地利用好自己深度工作的习惯需要训练。如上文中所阐述的，训练必须坚持两个目标：高强度提高你集中注意力的能力和克服分心的欲望。这些策略包括很多方法，从隔离分心到掌握一种形式特别的冥想。所有这些策略为你提供了一幅可行的路线图，使你从理智因不断分心而受损、不懂专注，转变成为真正能像激光一样专注。

## Don’t Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus.

Many assume that they can switch between a state of distraction and one of concentration as needed, but as I just argued, this assumption is optimistic: Once you’re wired for distraction, you crave it. Motivated by this reality, this strategy is designed to help you rewire your brain to a configuration better suited to staying on task.

许多人认为他们可以随心所欲地从分心状态切换到专注状态，但是正如我所说的，这种想法过于乐观：一旦你适应了分心，你就会迷恋于此。考虑到这个现实，这个策略就是帮助你重新编排大脑，让它的结构更适合长期专注于任务。

Before diving into the details, let’s start by considering a popular suggestion for distraction addiction that doesn’t quite solve our problem: the Internet Sabbath (sometimes called a digital detox). In its basic form, this ritual asks you to put aside regular time—typically, one day a week—where you refrain from network technology. In the same way that the Sabbath in the Hebrew Bible induces a period of quiet and reflection well suited to appreciate God and his works, the Internet Sabbath is meant to remind you of what you miss when you are glued to a screen.

在讨论细节之前，让我们来看一个解决分心的建议，这个建议虽然流行但是并不能起多大作用：网络安息日（有时也叫作数字排毒）。这个仪式最基本的概念就是让你经常性地——通常是每周一天——让自己摆脱网络技术。这就如同希伯来圣经中的安息日，拿出一段时间来静处与反思，以感恩上帝和他的恩赐。网络安息日的目的是让你懂得你在紧盯着屏幕时所失去的东西。

It’s unclear who first introduced the Internet Sabbath concept, but credit for popularizing the idea often goes to the journalist William Powers, who promoted the practice in his 2010 reflection on technology and human happiness, *Hamlet’s BlackBerry*. As Powers later summarizes in an interview: “Do what Thoreau did, which is learn to have a little disconnectedness within the connected world—don’t run away.”

网络安息日的起源并不明确，但其流行通常归功于记者威廉·鲍尔斯（William Powers）。他在 2010 年出版的《哈姆雷特的黑莓》（Hamlet’s BlackBerry）中对技术与人类幸福感进行了思考，使网络安息日的做法得以流行。正如鲍尔斯在后来的一次采访中说的：“学习梭罗，在这个普遍联系的世界里有一点点的失联。”

A lot of advice for the problem of distraction follows this general template of finding occasional time to get away from the clatter. Some put aside one or two months a year to escape these tethers, others follow Powers’s one-day-a-week advice, while others put aside an hour or two every day for the same purpose. All forms of this advice provide some benefit, but once we see the distraction problem in terms of brain wiring, it becomes clear that an Internet Sabbath cannot by itself cure a distracted brain. If you eat healthy just one day a week, you’re unlikely to lose weight, as the majority of your time is still spent gorging. Similarly, if you spend just one day a week resisting distraction, you’re unlikely to diminish your brain’s craving for these stimuli, as most of your time is still spent giving in to it.

很多针对分心的建议都是类似于这种暂时性摆脱网络喧嚣的方法。有些人拿出每年中的一到两个月来摆脱牵绊；有些人遵循鲍尔斯每周一天的建议；还有一些人则是拿出每天的一到两个小时。所有与此类似的建议都会带来益处，但是一旦我们知道分心问题会影响到大脑的编排，我们就会明白仅仅是网络安息日并不能治愈已适应分心状态的大脑。这就像如果你只能保证每周一天的健康饮食，而其他的时间暴饮暴食，你就很难变瘦。与之相似，如果你只是每周一天来对付分心，恐怕也难以有效地减少大脑对它的依赖，因为你大部分的时间仍然是屈从于分心。

I propose an alternative to the Internet Sabbath. Instead of scheduling the occasional break *from distraction* so you can focus, you should instead schedule the occasional break *from focus* to give in to distraction. To make this suggestion more concrete, let’s make the simplifying assumption that Internet use is synonymous with seeking distracting stimuli. (You can, of course, use the Internet in a way that’s focused and deep, but for a distraction addict, this is a difficult task.) Similarly, let’s consider working in the absence of the Internet to be synonymous with more focused work. (You can, of course, find ways to be distracted without a network connection, but these tend to be easier to resist.)

我有一个替代网络安息日的方法。与其偶尔从分心中拿出部分时间来专注，你更应该从专注中规划出偶尔的分心。具体讲来，我们可以把使用网络看作寻求使人分心的刺激。（当然，你可以以专注的深度方式来使用网络，但是对于一个分心成瘾者来说，这是很难的。）同样的，我们暂且认为没有网络的工作是更专注的工作。（当然，在没有网络的情况下，你也会分心，但这种分心通常更容易抵挡。）

With these rough categorizations established, the strategy works as follows: Schedule in advance when you’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times. I suggest that you keep a notepad near your computer at work. On this pad, record the *next* time you’re allowed to use the Internet. Until you arrive at that time, absolutely no network connectivity is allowed—no matter how tempting.

在这样粗略的分类下，我们的策略如下：预先计划好你使用网络的时间，然后在这些时间之外完全避免使用网络。我建议你在自己工作的电脑旁边放一个笔记本。在笔记本上，记录你下一次使用网络的时间。直到那个时间前，无论面对何种诱惑，都不能接触任何与网络相关的东西。

The idea motivating this strategy is that the use of a distracting service does not, by itself, reduce your brain’s ability to focus. It’s instead the constant *switching* from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty. This constant switching can be understood analogously as weakening the mental muscles responsible for organizing the many sources vying for your attention. By segregating Internet use (and therefore segregating distractions) you’re minimizing the number of times you give in to distraction, and by doing so you let these attention-selecting muscles strengthen.

这个策略背后的理念是：使用令人分心的网络工具这件事本身，并不能减损你大脑专注的能力。实际上减损这种能力的行为是，稍有无聊或遭遇一点点认知上的挑战，就从低刺激、高价值的活动转向高刺激、低价值的活动，这使得你的大脑不能容忍没有新奇性的东西。这种经常性的转换可以理解为削弱组织各个部门集中注意力的心理力量。通过分割网络使用（这也就相当于分割了分心），减少了自己向分心屈服的次数，这样就增强了自己控制注意力的力量。

For example, if you’ve scheduled your next Internet block thirty minutes from the current moment, and you’re beginning to feel bored and crave distraction, the next thirty minutes of resistance become a session of concentration calisthenics. A full day of scheduled distraction therefore becomes a full day of similar mental training.

举个例子，如果你当前制定了 30 分钟内禁止使用网络的计划，然后开始感觉到无聊并渴望消遣，那么接下来这 30 分钟的对抗就成了一个阶段性集中注意力的锻炼操。计划一整天的分心就因此成了一整天的心智训练。

While the basic idea behind this strategy is straightforward, putting it into practice can be tricky. To help you succeed, here are three important points to consider.

虽然这个策略背后的基本理念是简单的，实践却不那么容易。为了帮助你实践这个理念，在此强调三个需要考虑的重点。

**Point #1: This strategy works even if your job requires lots of Internet use and/or prompt e-mail replies.**

**第一点：即使你的工作需要大量使用网络和快速回复电子邮件，这个策略也适用。**

If you’re required to spend hours every day online or answer e-mails quickly, that’s fine: This simply means that your *Internet blocks* will be more numerous than those of someone whose job requires less connectivity. The total number or duration of your Internet blocks doesn’t matter nearly as much as making sure that the integrity of your *offline blocks* remains intact.

如果你每天都必须花数小时上网或者迅速回复电子邮件，那也无妨，这不过是意味着你的网络时段次数将远远多于那些工作中需要较少接入网络的人。相对于保证你离线时段的完整性，网络时段的总次数和时长并没有那么重要。

Imagine, for example, that over a two-hour period between meetings, you must schedule an e-mail check every fifteen minutes. Further imagine that these checks require, on average, five minutes. It’s sufficient, therefore, to schedule an Internet block every fifteen minutes through this two-hour stretch, with the rest of the time dedicated to offline blocks. In this example, you’ll end up spending around ninety minutes out of this two-hour period in a state where you’re offline and actively resisting distraction. This works out to be a large amount of concentration training that’s achieved without requiring you to sacrifice too much connectivity.

举个例子，假设在两次会议之间有两个小时，你必须每 15 分钟就安排查收一次邮件。再进一步，假设平均每次查收都需要 5 分钟。那么在这两个小时的时间段里，每 15 分钟安排一次网络时段，剩下的时间全部为离线时段，这就足够了。在这个例子中，在两个小时内，你就有 90 分钟处于离线状态，并主动抵挡分心。这样，不需要牺牲太多的网络接入，就可以实现大量的专注训练。

**Point #2: Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use.**

**第二点：不论你怎么计划网络时段，都必须保证在这些时段外彻底屏蔽网络。**

This objective is easy to state in principle but quickly becomes tricky in the messy reality of the standard workday. An inevitable issue you’ll face when executing this strategy is realizing early on in an offline block that there’s some crucial piece of information online that you need to retrieve to continue making progress on your current task. If your next Internet block doesn’t start for a while, you might end up stuck. The temptation in this situation is to quickly give in, look up the information, then return to your offline block. *You must resist this temptation!* The Internet is seductive: You may think you’re just retrieving a single key e-mail from your inbox, but you’ll find it hard to not glance at the other “urgent” messages that have recently arrived. It doesn’t take many of these exceptions before your mind begins to treat the barrier between Internet and offline blocks as permeable—diminishing the benefits of this strategy.

这个目标的道理浅显易懂，但是面对日常工作中复杂的现实，要实现这个目标却十分棘手。在执行这个策略的时候，你必然将遇到这样的问题：在离线时段刚开始的时候，为了来继续推进当前的工作，你需要上网检索某些重要的信息。如果网络时段不能马上开始的话，你的工作就可能陷入停滞。在这种情况下，你可能会立即让步，上网检索后再恢复到离线时段。你必须抵挡这种诱惑！网络是有诱惑性的：你可能认为自己只是从收件箱中查找了一份重要的电子邮件，但其实你将很难拒绝浏览其他刚刚收到的“重要”信息。如此一来，用不了多久你的大脑就开始混淆网络时段和离线时段的界限——这就削弱了该策略的益处。

It’s crucial in this situation, therefore, that you don’t immediately abandon an offline block, even when stuck. If it’s possible, switch to another offline activity for the remainder of the current block (or perhaps even fill in this time relaxing). If this is infeasible—perhaps you need to get the current offline activity done promptly—then the correct response is to *change* your schedule so that your next Internet block begins sooner. The key in making this change, however, is to not schedule the next Internet block to occur immediately. Instead, enforce at least a five-minute gap between the current moment and the next time you can go online. This gap is minor, so it won’t excessively impede your progress, but from a behavioralist perspective, it’s substantial because it separates the sensation of wanting to go online from the reward of actually doing so.

面对此种情况，要切记即使陷入停滞，也不能马上放弃离线时段。如果可以的话，在这个离线时段剩下的时间内进行另一种离线活动（或者甚至也可以用这段时间来放松）。如果不可以——因为可能你需要立即完成当前的离线活动——那么正确的反应应该是改变时间安排，尽快开始下一段网络时段。然而，这一改变的关键，不是安排下一个网络时段马上开始，而是至少等上 5 分钟再开始上网。5 分钟的时间并不长，不会过度阻碍你的进度，但是从行为主义角度来看，这却是意义重大的，因为这样做把你想要上网的感情与实际上网的回馈这两者割裂开来。

**Point #3: Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training.**

**第三点：在工作外也按计划使用网络，可以进一步提升专注训练的效果**

If you find yourself glued to a smartphone or laptop throughout your evenings and weekends, then it’s likely that your behavior outside of work is undoing many of your attempts during the workday to rewire your brain (which makes little distinction between the two settings). In this case, I would suggest that you maintain the strategy of scheduling Internet use even after the workday is over.

如果在晚上和周末，你都是粘在智能手机或者是笔记本上，那么这些工作外的行为就可能抵消工作中试图重新编排大脑的努力（你的大脑不太区分这两种情境）。因此我建议在工作日之外的时间里也坚持按计划使用网络。

To simplify matters, when scheduling Internet use after work, you can allow time-sensitive communication into your offline blocks (e.g., texting with a friend to agree on where you’ll meet for dinner), as well as time-sensitive information retrieval (e.g., looking up the location of the restaurant on your phone). Outside of these pragmatic exceptions, however, when in an offline block, put your phone away, ignore texts, and refrain from Internet usage. As in the workplace variation of this strategy, if the Internet plays a large and important role in your evening entertainment, that’s fine: Schedule lots of long Internet blocks. The key here isn’t to avoid or even to reduce the total amount of time you spend engaging in distracting behavior, but is instead to give yourself plenty of opportunities throughout your evening to *resist* switching to these distractions at the slightest hint of boredom.

简单说来，在工作外按计划使用网络时，你可以在离线时段允许对时间敏感的通讯（例如与一个朋友发短信确定在哪里一起吃晚餐），以及对时间敏感的信息检索（比如说在手机上查找某饭馆的地址）。除了这些实用主义的网络使用之外，在离线时段，要收起手机，无视短信并限制使用网络。该策略因具体情况不同可做出适当改变，如果在你的晚间娱乐中网络具有重要地位和作用，那也无妨的：你可以计划大量的长时间的网络时段。这里的关键不是避免，甚至不是减少你花在令人分心的活动上面的时间，而是在整个晚上给你更多的机会，在面对些许无聊的时候，抵挡住转换到令人分心活动上的诱惑。

One place where this strategy becomes particularly difficult outside work is when you’re forced to wait (for example, standing in line at a store). It’s crucial in these situations that if you’re in an offline block, you simply gird yourself for the temporary boredom, and fight through it with only the company of your thoughts. To simply wait and be bored has become a novel experience in modern life, but from the perspective of concentration training, it’s incredibly valuable.

当你被迫等待的时候（例如在商店里排队），执行这种策略会变得尤其困难。在这个时刻，如果你正处于离线阶段，那么一定要忍耐这暂时的无聊，凭借大脑的思考度过这一段时间。静静等待并忍受无聊已经成为现代生活的一种新奇体验，从集中注意力训练的角度出发，这具有不可思议的重要价值。

To summarize, to succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli. This doesn’t mean that you have to eliminate distracting behaviors; it’s sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention. The simple strategy proposed here of scheduling Internet blocks goes a long way toward helping you regain this attention autonomy.

总而言之，如果想凭借深度工作成功，你就必须重新编排自己的大脑，使它可以从容地抵挡令人分心的刺激。这并不意味着你需要清除令人分心的活动，而仅仅需要清除这些活动劫持你注意力的可能就足够了。我们提出的计划网络时段的简单策略，会对你重新获得注意力自主权有很大的帮助。

## Work Like Teddy Roosevelt

If you attended Harvard College during the 1876–1877 school year, you would’ve likely noticed a wiry, mutton-chopped, brash, and impossibly energetic freshman named Theodore Roosevelt. If you then proceeded to befriend this young man, you would’ve soon noticed a paradox.

如果你在 1876-1877 学年就读于哈佛学院（Harvard College），就很可能会注意到一名声音尖细、留着羊排式络腮胡、傲慢并且精力出奇旺盛的大一新生，他名为西奥多·罗斯福（Theodore Roosevelt）。如果你进一步与这个年轻人交往，可能很快就会发现一个悖论。

On the one hand, his attention might appear to be hopelessly scattered, spread over what one classmate called an “amazing array of interests”—a list that biographer Edmund Morris catalogs to contain boxing, wrestling, body building, dance lessons, poetry readings, and the continuation of a lifelong obsession with naturalism (Roosevelt’s landlord on Winthrop Street was not pleased with her young tenant’s tendency to dissect and stuff specimens in his rented room). This latter interest developed to the point that Roosevelt published his first book, *The Summer Birds of the Adirondacks*, in the summer after his freshman year. It was well received in the *Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club*—a publication, needless to say, which takes bird books quite seriously—and was good enough to lead Morris to assess Roosevelt, at this young age, to be “one of the most knowledgeable young naturalists in the United States.”

一方面，他的注意力可能看起来是分散得令人绝望，如他的同学戏称，遍布于一组“惊人的兴趣排列”，根据传记作家埃德蒙德·莫里斯（Edmund Morris）统计，他的兴趣包括拳击、摔跤、健身、舞蹈课、诗歌阅读和他毕生所爱的自然学（罗斯福在温斯洛普街的房东就很不满意他的这位年轻房客在房间里解剖和制作标本）。这最后一个兴趣发展得很好，在大一结束的夏天，罗斯福出版了自己的第一本书《阿迪朗达克山脉夏季里的鸟》（The Summer Birds of the Adirondacks）。这本书获得了《纳塔尔鸟类学俱乐部公报》（Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club）的好评，以至于莫里斯认为年轻的罗斯福已经是“美国最博学的青年自然学者之一”。

To support this extracurricular exuberance Roosevelt had to severely restrict the time left available for what should have been his primary focus: his studies at Harvard. Morris used Roosevelt’s diary and letters from this period to estimate that the future president was spending no more than a quarter of the typical day studying. One might expect therefore that Roosevelt’s grades would crater. But they didn’t. He wasn’t the top student in his class, but he certainly didn’t struggle either: In his freshman year he earned honor grades in five out of his seven courses. The explanation for this Roosevelt paradox turns out to be his unique approach to tackling this schoolwork. Roosevelt would begin his scheduling by considering the eight hours from eight thirty a.m. to four thirty p.m. He would then remove the time spent in recitation and classes, his athletic training (which was once a day), and lunch. The fragments that remained were then considered time dedicated exclusively to studying. As noted, these fragments didn’t usually add up to a large number of total hours, but he would get the most out of them by working *only* on schoolwork during these periods, and doing so with a blistering *intensity*. “The amount of time he spent at his desk was comparatively small,” explained Morris, “but his concentration was so intense, and his reading so rapid, that he could afford more time off [from schoolwork] than most.”

为了开展这些课程外的爱好活动，罗斯福不得不大大缩减本应该用在学习主业上的时间。莫里斯根据罗斯福当时的日记和信件，推测这位未来的总统通常每天只有不超过四分之一的时间用于学习。大家可能以为罗斯福的学习成绩会惨不忍睹，但事实相反。他虽然不是班里的尖子生，但成绩也不赖：在大一的 7 门课程中，他获得了 5 门优秀。对于罗斯福悖论的解释就在于他处理学业的独特方式，在于从上午 8 点半到下午 4 点半这 8 个小时的日程安排。在这 8 小时内，他预留出时间给背诵和班级课程、体育锻炼（通常是一天一次）以及午饭。余下的时间全部用于专注学习。如前文所述，这些时间加起来也没有多少，但是通过在这些时间内只攻读课业并以极大的强度攻读，他可以实现最高效的时间利用。莫里斯介绍说：“他待在书桌前的时间比较少，但是注意力十分集中，他的阅读速度十分快，所以可以比大多数人（从课业中）节省出更多的时间。”

This strategy asks you to inject the occasional dash of Rooseveltian intensity into your own workday. In particular, identify a deep task (that is, something that requires deep work to complete) that’s high on your priority list. Estimate how long you’d normally put aside for an obligation of this type, then give yourself a hard deadline that *drastically reduces* this time. If possible, commit publicly to the deadline—for example, by telling the person expecting the finished project when they should expect it. If this isn’t possible (or if it puts your job in jeopardy), then motivate yourself by setting a countdown timer on your phone and propping it up where you can’t avoid seeing it as you work.

这个策略就是要求你在日常工作中，不时地像罗斯福一样发起冲锋。特别要找出一项优先性很高的深度任务（即需要深度工作才能完成的任务）。估算出通常完成此类型任务需要的时间，然后设定一个硬性截止期限，留出的时间远远少于估算时间。如果可以的话，公开自己的这个截止期限——例如，告诉等待工程结束的人工程何时结束。如果不可以（或者是公开截止期限会使自己的工作陷入危险境地），那么就在手机上设一个倒计时，并确保在工作的时候无法忽略倒计时的存在。

At this point, there should be only one possible way to get the deep task done in time: *working with great intensity*—no e-mail breaks, no daydreaming, no Facebook browsing, no repeated trips to the coffee machine. Like Roosevelt at Harvard, attack the task with every free neuron until it gives way under your unwavering barrage of concentration.

此时此刻，解决深度任务的方法只有一个：高强度工作——不查收电子邮件，不做白日梦，不浏览脸谱网页面，不数次来到咖啡机泡咖啡。就像在哈佛的罗斯福，利用每一束空闲的神经元来处理任务，直到你用自己不懈的高度精力集中解决了任务。

Try this experiment no more than once a week at first—giving your brain practice with intensity, but also giving it (and your stress levels) time to rest in between. Once you feel confident in your ability to trade concentration for completion time, increase the frequency of these Roosevelt dashes. Remember, however, to always keep your self-imposed deadlines right at the edge of feasibility. You should be able to consistently beat the buzzer (or at least be close), but to do so should require teeth-gritting concentration.

刚开始的时候，一周进行这种实验的次数不要超过一次——让你的大脑提高强度，但是也要给它休息的时间。一旦你相信自己可以用专注的方法来节省时间，就提高这种罗斯福冲锋的频率。有一点需要提醒的是，一定要给自己设定一个几乎不可能的时间期限。你应该总是可以赶在最后期限前完成任务（至少是接近），但是这期间需要你用上吃奶的力气。

The main motivation for this strategy is straightforward. Deep work requires levels of concentration well beyond where most knowledge workers are comfortable. Roosevelt dashes leverage artificial deadlines to help you systematically increase the level you can regularly achieve—providing, in some sense, interval training for the attention centers of your brain. An additional benefit is that these dashes are incompatible with distraction (there’s no way you can give in to distraction and still make your deadlines). Therefore, every completed dash provides a session in which you’re potentially bored, and really want to seek more novel stimuli—but you resist. As argued in the previous strategy, the more you practice resisting such urges, the easier such resistance becomes.

这个策略的主要意图很明显。深度工作需要专注的强度远远超出了大部分知识工作者的舒适区。从某种意义上说，罗斯福冲锋配以截止期限，为大脑控制注意力的部分提供了反复的训练，可以系统性地提升你平时的成就水平。另一个益处就是这些冲锋不与分心兼容（在分心的情况下，你是不可能赶在截止期限前完成任务的）。因此，每一次的冲锋都是一个抵抗新奇刺激的过程：你心底里感到无聊，并且真的想寻求更多的新奇刺激，但是你得抵抗。正如我们在前边所讨论的，你抵抗这种冲动的实践越多，你的抵抗力就越强。

After a few months of deploying this strategy, your understanding of what it means to focus will likely be transformed as you reach levels of intensity stronger than anything you’ve experienced before. And if you’re anything like a young Roosevelt, you can then repurpose the extra free time it generates toward the finer pleasures in life, like trying to impress the always-discerning members of the Nuttall Ornithological Club.

在应用这个策略几个月之后，随着前所未有的高强度体验，你对于专注的理解也会改变。如果你像年轻的罗斯福一样，就可以把由此节省出来的时间投入到生活中的赏心乐事中，比如说试着打动那些眼光老辣的纳塔尔鸟类学俱乐部成员。

## Meditate Productively

During the two years I spent as a postdoctoral associate at MIT, my wife and I lived in a small but charming apartment on Pinckney Street, in historic Beacon Hill. Though I lived in Boston and worked in Cambridge, the two locations were close—only a mile apart, sitting on opposite banks of the Charles River. Intent on staying fit, even during the long and dark New England winter, I decided to take advantage of this proximity by traveling between home and work, to the greatest extent possible, on foot.

在麻省理工做博士后副研究员的两年里，太太和我住在著名的灯塔山（Beacon Hill）平克尼街（Pinckney Street）的一套公寓里，这套公寓虽小，却很精致。我住在波士顿，工作在剑桥，这两个地方隔查尔斯河（Charles River）相望，距离不远，只有一英里。为了健身，我决定利用好这一段距离，在家与学校之间往返的时候尽可能步行，即使是在新英格兰（New England）漫长黑暗的冬天也不例外。

My routine had me walk to campus in the morning, crossing the Longfellow Bridge in all weather (the city, it turns out to my dismay, is often slow to shovel the pedestrian path after snowstorms). Around lunch, I would change into running gear and run back home on a longer path that followed the banks of the Charles, crossing at the Massachusetts Avenue Bridge. After a quick lunch and shower at home, I would typically take the subway across the river on the way back to campus (saving, perhaps, a third of a mile on the trek), and then walk home when the workday was done. In other words, I spent *a lot* of time on my feet during this period. It was this reality that led me to develop the practice that I’ll now suggest you adopt in your own deep work training: *productive meditation*.

不论天气如何，我的路线都保持不变，早上经过朗费罗大桥（Longfellow Bridge）步行去校园（令人失望的是，暴风雪过后，这个城市经常不及时铲掉人行道上的雪）；中午，我会换上跑步装，沿着更长的一条路跑回家，沿着查尔斯河河岸，经过马萨大道桥（Massachusetts Avenue Bridge）；在家迅速地吃过午餐，冲个澡，然后坐地铁回学校（这样可以少走三分之一英里），在结束一天的工作后，我会再步行回家。换句话说，在那段期间内，我花在走路上的时间很多。正是这个现实情况使我培养了一个习惯，现在我建议你在自己的深度工作训练中也采用，它就是：有成果的冥想。

The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you’re occupied physically but not mentally—walking, jogging, driving, showering—and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem. Depending on your profession, this problem might be outlining an article, writing a talk, making progress on a proof, or attempting to sharpen a business strategy. As in mindfulness meditation, you must continue to bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls.

有成果的冥想的目标是：在身体劳作而心智空闲的时候（比如走路、慢跑、开车、淋浴），将注意力集中到一件定义明确的专业难题上。因个人专业不同，这个难题可能是为一篇文章列提纲，写一篇讲话稿，推演一个证明，或者是打磨一个商业策略。如同佛教的打坐，你的注意力可能会涣散或停滞，但你必须不断的把它重新集中到当前的问题上。

I used to practice productive meditation in at least one of my daily cross-river treks while living in Boston, and as I improved, so did my results. I ended up, for example, working out the chapter outlines for a significant portion of my last book while on foot, and made progress on many knotty technical problems in my academic research.

住在波士顿时，在每天上下班的过河旅途中，我至少做一次有成果的冥想。随着这方面能力的提高，我的成绩也有了提升。比如说，在步行的路上，我想好了上一本书的大部分章节的提纲，也在攻克学术研究方面的棘手问题上取得了进展。

I suggest that you adopt a productive meditation practice in your own life. You don’t necessarily need a serious session every day, but your goal should be to participate in at least two or three such sessions in a typical week. Fortunately, finding time for this strategy is easy, as it takes advantage of periods that would otherwise be wasted (such as walking the dog or commuting to work), and if done right, can actually increase your professional productivity instead of taking time away from your work. In fact, you might even consider scheduling a walk during your workday specifically for the purpose of applying productive meditation to your most pressing problem at the moment.

我建议你在生活中采用有成果的冥想。你并不需要每天进行严格的练习，一周进行至少两到三次即可。幸运的是，为这个策略找时间是简单的，因为这只需要你利用本可能被浪费掉的时间（比如说遛狗和通勤）。如果一切顺利，这种做法可以提升你在专业上的产出，却不需要占用你的工作时间。实际上，为了用有成果的冥想来解决你当前最紧急的问题，你甚至可以考虑在工作时间安排一次散步。

I’m not, however, suggesting this practice for its productivity benefits (though they’re nice). I’m instead interested in its ability to rapidly improve your ability to think deeply. In my experience, productive meditation builds on both of the key ideas introduced at the beginning of this rule. By forcing you to resist distraction and return your attention repeatedly to a well-defined problem, it helps strengthen your distraction-resisting muscles, and by forcing you to push your focus deeper and deeper on a single problem, it sharpens your concentration.

然而，我在这推荐有成果的冥想并不仅仅是因为它能提高生产效率（这当然已经很好了），而是因为它可以迅速提高你深度思考的能力。按照我的经验，有成果的冥想可以帮助你实现在本准则引言中介绍的两个关键理念。它通过迫使你抵抗分心，不断地把自己的注意力集中到一个定义明确的问题上，来增强你抵抗分心的心智。通过迫使你在一个问题上不断深入研究，助力专注能力的提升。

To succeed with productive meditation, it’s important to recognize that, like any form of meditation, it requires practice to do well. When I first attempted this strategy, back in the early weeks of my postdoc, I found myself hopelessly distracted—ending long stretches of “thinking” with little new to show for my efforts. It took me a dozen or so sessions before I began to experience real results. You should expect something similar, so patience will be necessary. To help accelerate this ramp-up process, however, I have two specific suggestions to offer.

为了更好地利用有成果的冥想，有一点必须要注意，那就是和其他的冥想一样，这种能力需要实践来磨炼。回想在我读博士后的头几个星期，第一次尝试这个策略的时候，我发现自己分心的程度简直不可救药——努力“想”了很久却没有结果。我尝试了十几次之后，才开始取得实际成果。你可能也会遇到类似的情况，所以耐心是十分重要的。为了帮助你加速这个上手的过程，在此提供两条具体建议。

**Suggestion #1: Be Wary of Distractions and Looping**

**建议 1：小心分心和原地打转**

As a novice, when you begin a productive meditation session, your mind’s first act of rebellion will be to offer unrelated but seemingly more interesting thoughts. My mind, for example, was often successful at derailing my attention by beginning to compose an e-mail that I knew I needed to write. Objectively speaking, this train of thought sounds exceedingly dull, but in the moment it can become impossibly tantalizing. When you notice your attention slipping away from the problem at hand, gently remind yourself that you can return to that thought later, then redirect your attention back.

在开始有成果的冥想时，初学者大脑出现的第一种反抗就是引来许多无关但是好像更有趣的想法。以我个人为例，我的大脑经常成功地把我的注意力拐走，让我去编辑一份电子邮件。客观来讲，编辑电子邮件的想法听起来十分无聊，但是在那个时刻，其诱惑性却变得难以抵挡。当你发现某个想法偷走了你的注意力时，温柔地提醒自己可以稍后再回到这个想法上，现在先把你的注意力收回来。

Distraction of this type, in many ways, is the obvious enemy to defeat in developing a productive meditation habit. A subtler, but equally effective adversary, is looping. When faced with a hard problem, your mind, as it was evolved to do, will attempt to avoid excess expenditure of energy when possible. One way it might attempt to sidestep this expenditure is by avoiding diving deeper into the problem by instead looping over and over again on what you already know about it. For example, when working on a proof, my mind has a tendency to rehash simple preliminary results, again and again, to avoid the harder work of building on these results toward the needed solution. You must be on your guard for looping, as it can quickly subvert an entire productive meditation session. When you notice it, remark to yourself that you seem to be in a loop, then redirect your attention toward the next step.

这种分心会从很多方面阻碍你养成有成果的冥想习惯。还有一个不明显，但是有同等效果的阻碍，那就是原地打转。面对一个难题时，你的大脑会尽可能地避免浪费过多能量。这是人类演化的结果。其节省能量的一种方法就是避免深度思考难题，而是围着这个难题的已知部分不断地打转。例如，在做证明的时候，大脑会有反复研究简单的初步成果的倾向，避免根据这些成果去做艰难的工作以获得最后的结果。你必须警惕原地打转，因为它可以迅速破坏整个有成果的冥想。当你发现类似的迹象之后，要提醒自己可能在原地打转，然后把自己的注意力推向下一步。

**Suggestion #2: Structure Your Deep Thinking**

**建议 2：组织你的深度思考**

“Thinking deeply” about a problem seems like a self-evident activity, but in reality it’s not. When faced with a distraction-free mental landscape, a hard problem, and time to think, the next steps can become surprisingly non-obvious. In my experience, it helps to have some structure for this deep thinking process. I suggest starting with a careful review of the relevant *variables* for solving the problem and then storing these values in your working memory. For example, if you’re working on the outline for a book chapter, the relevant variables might be the main points you want to make in the chapter. If you’re instead trying to solve a mathematics proof, these variables might be actual variables, or assumptions, or lemmas. Once the relevant variables are identified, define the specific *next-step question* you need to answer using these variables. In the book chapter example, this next-step question might be, “How am I going to effectively open this chapter?,” and for a proof it might be, “What can go wrong if I don’t assume this property holds?” With the relevant variables stored and the next-step question identified, you now have a specific target for your attention.

对一个难题进行“深度思考”似乎是一种自然而然的活动，但实际上却不是。在没有分心的心智状态下，你遇到一个难题，并且也有时间思考，接下来该怎么做却并不会自动显现。按照我的经验，深度思考是需要有一定架构的。我建议首先仔细考察解决这个问题的相关变量，然后在工作中留心这些因素。例如，如果你正在思考一本书中某个章节的提纲，那么相关的变量就可能是在这章节中所要表达的意见。如果你是在试图解决一个数学证明，相关的变量就可能真的是数学中的变量、假设或前提。一旦确定了相关变量，就用它们来确定你下一步需要解决的具体问题。在写书的那个例子中，下一步的问题可能是“我如何有效的开篇”；在证明中，下一步的问题可能是“如果这个性质不成立，那么哪里会出错”。通过考虑这些相关变量，明确下一步的问题，这样就为自己的注意力指明了方向。

Assuming you’re able to solve your next-step question, the final step of this structured approach to deep thinking is to *consolidate* your gains by reviewing clearly the answer you identified. At this point, you can push yourself to the next level of depth by starting the process over. This cycle of reviewing and storing variables, identifying and tackling the next-step question, then consolidating your gains is like an intense workout routine for your concentration ability. It will help you get more out of your productive meditation sessions and accelerate the pace at which you improve your ability to go deep.

假设你顺利解决了下一步的问题，这个有架构的方法的最后一步就是通过考察所得的答案来巩固收获。这样通过再一次执行这个程序，你可以提高自己的深度层次。考察和记忆变量，确定和处理下一步问题，然后巩固你的收获，这样的一个循环就像是一个提高专注能力的高强度健身流程。可以使有成果的冥想更有成效，并加速提高你进行深度活动的能力。

## Memorize a Deck of Cards

Given just five minutes, Daniel Kilov can memorize any of the following: a shuffled deck of cards, a string of one hundred random digits, or 115 abstract shapes (this last feat establishing an Australian national record). It shouldn’t be surprising, therefore, that Kilov recently won back-to-back silver medals in the Australian memory championships. What *is* perhaps surprising, given Kilov’s history, is that he ended up a mental athlete at all.

只需要 5 分钟，丹尼尔·基洛夫（Daniel Kilov）就可以记住以下任何一项：一副洗好的牌，一串 100 个随机数字，或者是 115 个抽象图形（最后一项创造了澳大利亚国家记录）。因此，基洛夫最近在澳大利亚记忆力冠军赛中又赢得了一枚银牌，这已经不足为奇了。可能会令人惊奇的是，通过回顾基洛夫的往事，根本无法相信他最后会成为一名心智运动员。

“I wasn’t born with an exceptional memory,” Kilov told me. Indeed, during high school he considered himself forgetful and disorganized. He also struggled academically and was eventually diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. It was after a chance encounter with Tansel Ali, one of the country’s most successful and visible memory champions, that Kilov began to seriously train his memory. By the time he earned his college degree he had won his first national competition medal.

基洛夫告诉我：“我超乎寻常的记忆力不是天生的。”实际上，他回想自己在高中的时候，健忘又散漫。他遇到了学业困难，最终被诊断为注意力缺失症。在一次巧遇当时澳大利亚最成功的记忆力冠军坦赛尔·阿里（Tansel Ali）后，基洛夫开始认真训练自己的记忆力。等到获得大学学位时，他已经赢得了自己第一枚全国性竞赛的奖牌。

This transformation into a world-class mental athlete was rapid, but not unprecedented. In 2006, the American science writer Joshua Foer won the USA Memory Championship after only a year of (intense) training—a journey he chronicled in his 2011 bestseller, *Moonwalking with Einstein*. But what’s important to us about Kilov’s story is what happened to his *academic* performance during this period of intensive memory development. While training his brain, he went from a struggling student with attention deficit disorder to graduating from a demanding Australian university with first-class honors. He was soon accepted into the PhD program at one of the country’s top universities, where he currently studies under a renowned philosopher.

他向世界级的心智运动员的转变是迅速的，却不是独一无二的。2006 年，美国科学作家乔舒亚·弗尔（Joshua Foer）赢得了美国记忆力冠军赛。根据他在 2011 年出版的畅销书《与爱因斯坦一起在月球上行走》（Moonwalking with Einstein）的记载，在这之前他也只进行了一年的（高强度）训练。在这里我们讲基洛夫的故事要强调，他在记忆力高强度训练期间学业表现发生的变化。通过大脑训练，他从一个有注意力缺失症的困难生变成了一所高标准澳大利亚大学的一等荣誉毕业生。不久后，他就被该国的一所顶尖大学的博士生项目录取，当前在某著名教授指导下学习。

One explanation for this transformation comes from research led by Henry Roediger, who runs the Memory Lab at the University of Washington in Saint Louis. In 2014, Roediger and his collaborators sent a team, equipped with a battery of cognitive tests, to the Extreme Memory Tournament held in San Diego. They wanted to understand what differentiated these elite memorizers from the population at large. “We found that one of the biggest differences between memory athletes and the rest of us is in a cognitive ability that’s not a direct measure of memory at all *but of attention*,” explained Roediger in a *New York Times* blog post (emphasis mine). The ability in question is called “attentional control,” and it measures the subjects’ ability to maintain their focus on essential information.

圣路易斯市（Saint Louis）华盛顿大学的记忆力实验室负责人亨利·罗迪格（Henry Roediger）向我们揭示了这种转变的原因。2014 年，罗迪格和他的合作者向在圣地亚哥举行的极限记忆力锦标赛（Extreme Memory Tournament）派遣了一个工作组。这个工作组带去了一系列认知测验。他们想知道记忆力超群者和普通人的区别到底在哪里。后来，罗迪格在《纽约时报》的博客上说：“我们发现记忆力运动员和其他人之间在认知能力方面最大的区别不在于能够直接测量的记忆力，而在于注意力。”这种能力叫作“注意力控制”，是测量研究对象对于关键信息保持专注的能力。

A side effect of memory training, in other words, is an improvement in your general ability to concentrate. This ability can then be fruitfully applied to any task demanding deep work. Daniel Kilov, we can therefore conjecture, didn’t become a star student because of his award-winning memory; it was instead his quest to improve this memory that (incidentally) gave him the deep work edge needed to thrive academically.

换句话说，记忆力训练带来了意外的收获：个人专注能力的提升。这个能力的提升可以很好地应用到任何需要深度工作的任务上。我们可以这样断言：丹尼尔·基洛夫并不是因为卓越的记忆力而变成明星学生，而是由于他在提高个人记忆力的同时（意外地）获得了进行深度工作的优势，这对于学业十分关键。

The strategy described here asks you to replicate a key piece of Kilov’s training, and therefore gain some of the same improvements to your concentration. In particular, it asks you to learn a standard but quite impressive skill in the repertoire of most mental athletes: the ability to memorize a shuffled deck of cards.

我们这里的策略就是请你模仿基洛夫训练中的一个关键部分，并借此获得集中注意力能力的提升。这个策略要求你学习一个大多数心智运动员节目单中都有的、但又令人印象十分深刻的标准技能：记住一副洗过的牌。

The technique for card memorization I’ll teach you comes from someone who knows quite a bit about this particular challenge: Ron White, a former USA Memory Champion and world record holder in card memorization. The first thing White emphasizes is that professional memory athletes *never* attempt rote memorization, that is, where you simply look at information again and again, repeating it in your head. This approach to retention, though popular among burned-out students, misunderstands how our brains work. We’re not wired to quickly internalize abstract information. We are, however, really good at remembering scenes. Think back to a recent memorable event in your life: perhaps attending the opening session of a conference or meeting a friend you haven’t seen in a while for a drink. Try to picture the scene as clearly as possible. Most people in this scenario can conjure a surprisingly vivid recollection of the event—even though you made no special effort to remember it at the time. If you systematically counted the unique details in this memory, the total number of items would likely be surprisingly numerous. Your mind, in other words, can quickly retain lots of detailed information—if it’s stored in the right way. Ron White’s card memorization technique builds on this insight.

我教你的这个记牌的窍门来自于一位业内人士：罗恩·怀特（Ron White）。他曾是美国记忆力冠军，记牌世界纪录的保持者。怀特强调的第一件事就是职业记忆力运动员从不试图死记硬背，不会去简单地反复阅读信息，然后在大脑中重复。这种记忆方法虽然在因学业而焦头烂额的学生中很流行，但它误解了我们大脑的工作方法。我们的大脑不适合去记抽象的信息，而是十分擅长记住场景。回想一件你生活中最近发生的难忘之事：可能是参加一次会议的开幕式，或者是与一位许久不见的朋友聚会饮酒。试着尽可能详细地描绘这个场景，即使在当时没有刻意去记忆这个场景，大多数人对于当时的事物记忆之清晰都会令人惊讶。如果系统地去数计这个记忆里的独特细节，总数可能会大得惊人。也就是说如果方法得当，你的大脑可以迅速记住大量细节信息。罗恩·怀特的记牌技能正是基于这一见解。

To prepare for this high-volume memorization task, White recommends that you begin by cementing in your mind the mental image of walking through five rooms in your home. Perhaps you come in the door, walk through your front hallway, then turn into the downstairs bathroom, walk out the door and enter the guest bedroom, walk into the kitchen, and then head down the stairs into your basement. In each room, conjure a clear image of what you see.

关于这种大信息量的记忆任务的准备工作，怀特建议首先穿行自己家里的 5 个房间，在大脑中建立一个影像库。你可能先从正门进入，穿过玄关，进入楼下的浴室，出门后再进入客房，进厨房，然后再进入地下室。记下你在每一个房间所看到的图像。

Once you can easily recall this mental walkthrough of a well-known location, fix in your mind a collection of ten items in each of these rooms. White recommends that these items be large (and therefore more memorable), like a desk, not a pencil. Next, establish an order in which you look at each of these items in each room. For example, in the front hallway, you might look at the entry mat, then shoes on the floor by the mat, then the bench above the shoes, and so on. Combined this is only fifty items, so add two more items, perhaps in your backyard, to get to the full fifty-two items you’ll later need when connecting these images to all the cards in a standard deck.

一旦你可以轻松回忆起这个熟悉地方的布置，那么就让大脑记住每一间房的 10 件物品。怀特建议选择大件物品（这样更便于记忆），比如说桌子，而不要选铅笔。接下来，为每一间房的这些东西排列顺序。比如说，在玄关，你可能看到了正门门垫，然后是门垫旁边的鞋子，然后是鞋子上方的长凳，诸如此类。有了这 50 个物品，再加上两个，可能是在后院里的物件，总之要凑齐 52 个。稍后你需要把这些物件的图像与一副标准扑克的牌联系起来。

Practice this mental exercise of walking through the rooms, and looking at items in each room, in a set order. You should find that this type of memorization, because it’s based on visual images of familiar places and things, will be much easier than the rote memorizing you might remember from your school days.

练习这种大脑锻炼操：穿过各个房间，按次序记住每间房中的物件。你会发现这种记忆，因为是建立在对熟悉的地点和事物的视觉形象上，会比在学校中使用的死记硬背来得简单。

The second step in preparing to memorize a deck of cards is to associate a memorable person or thing with each of the fifty-two possible cards. To make this process easier, try to maintain some logical association between the card and the corresponding image. White provides the example of associating Donald Trump with the King of Diamonds, as diamonds signify wealth. Practice these associations until you can pull a card randomly from the deck and immediately recall the associated image. As before, the use of memorable visual images and associations will simplify the task of forming these connections.

记住一副牌的第二步就是把 52 张牌中的每一张与一个难忘的人或东西相对应。方便起见，试着为每一张牌安排一个有逻辑联想的形象。怀特为我们举了一个例子，他把唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）与方片 K 联系起来，因为方片代表了财富。反复练习记忆这种联系，直到随机抽出任何一张牌，你都可以马上说出对应的形象。如之前所说的，我们使用的视觉形象和联想有助于我们建立联系。

The two steps mentioned previously are *advance* steps—things you do just once and can then leverage again and again in memorizing specific decks. Once these steps are done, you’re ready for the main event: memorizing as quickly as possible the order of fifty-two cards in a freshly shuffled deck. The method here is straightforward. Begin your mental walk-through of your house. As you encounter each item, look at the next card from the shuffled deck, and imagine the corresponding memorable person or thing doing something memorable near that item. For example, if the first item and location is the mat in your front entry, and the first card is the King of Diamonds, you might picture Donald Trump wiping mud off of his expensive loafers on the entry mat in your front hallway.

以上提到的两个步骤是准备步骤。这些准备在以后记任意一副牌的时候都可以重复用到，是一劳永逸的。一旦完成这些步骤，你就可以进行正式工作了：尽可能快地记住刚洗过的一副牌。方法很简单。开始在脑海中穿过你家。你每遭遇一件物品，就看一张牌，然后想象这张牌对应的难忘的人或东西在那件物品旁边做一件难忘的事。例如，如果第一件物品和位置是在正门门口的垫子，而第一张牌是方片 K，你就可以想象唐纳德·川普在你家玄关的正门门垫上擦去他那双昂贵皮鞋上的泥土。

Proceed carefully through the rooms, associating the proper mental images with objects in the proper order. After you complete a room, you might want to walk through it a few times in a row to lock in the imagery. Once you’re done, you’re ready to hand the deck to a friend and amaze him by rattling off the cards in order without peeking. To do so, of course, simply requires that you perform the mental walk-through one more time, connecting each memorable person or thing to its corresponding card as you turn your attention to it.

细心地往前穿行每一个房间，按照正确的顺序把正确的形象与物件联系起来。完成一个房间后，你可能会再连续反复走几次，以便将其铭记在脑海中。一旦完成这 52 对联系，你就可以把这副牌交给朋友，并且不需要偷看就把这些牌飞快地按顺序说出，让他大吃一惊。当然，要完成这个工作，你只需要再一次在脑海中穿过每一个房间，随着你的注意力逐一转移到每一个难忘的人或东西上，就能读出每一张对应的牌。

If you practice this technique, you’ll discover, like many mental athletes who came before you, that you can eventually internalize a whole deck in just minutes. More important than your ability to impress friends, of course, is the training such activities provide your mind. Proceeding through the steps described earlier requires that you focus your attention, again and again, on a clear target. Like a muscle responding to weights, this will strengthen your general ability to concentrate—allowing you to go deeper with more ease.

练习这一技巧，你将会像之前的那些心智运动员一样，发现自己可以在极短的时间里记住一整副牌。当然，它所带来的益处远远不止于震惊你的朋友，更重要的是这种练习给你的大脑所带来的提升。执行前述的几个步骤需要你不断反复地把注意力集中于一个明确的目标。就像重量可以锻炼肌肉，这个练习可以增强你专注的能力，让你更轻松地进行深度工作。

It’s worth emphasizing, however, the obvious point that there’s nothing special about card memorization. Any structured thought process that requires unwavering attention can have a similar effect—be it studying the Talmud, like Adam Marlin from Rule #2’s introduction, or practicing productive meditation, or trying to learn the guitar part of a song by ear (a past favorite of mine). If card memorization seems weird to you, in other words, then choose a replacement that makes similar cognitive requirements. The key to this strategy is not the specifics, but instead the motivating idea that your ability to concentrate is only as strong as your commitment to train it.

最后，我们还是要指出一个显而易见的道理：记牌并没有什么特别之处，任何需要持久注意力的有组织的思维过程都会有相似的功效。不管是准则 2 中开篇所说的像亚当·马林一样学习《塔木德》，或者是练习有成果的冥想，抑或是用耳朵来辨识一首歌曲中的吉他演奏（这是我过去的一个爱好）。如果记牌对你来说显得有点怪，那么就换一个类似的、也对认知有所要求的活动。本策略中的关键不在于以上所说的具体方法，关键在于记住一点：只要你愿意付出努力，就可以提高自己专注的能力。
