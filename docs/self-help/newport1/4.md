# Rule #1: Work Deeply

Soon after I met David Dewane for a drink at a Dupont Circle bar, he brought up the Eudaimonia Machine. Dewane is an architecture professor, and therefore likes to explore the intersection between the conceptual and the concrete. The Eudaimonia Machine is a good example of this intersection. The machine, which takes its name from the ancient Greek concept of *eudaimonia* (a state in which you’re achieving your full human potential), turns out to be a building. “The goal of the machine,” David explained, “is to create a setting where the users can get into a state of deep human flourishing—creating work that’s at the absolute extent of their personal abilities.” It is, in other words, a space designed for the sole purpose of enabling the deepest possible deep work. I was, as you might expect, intrigued.

我在杜邦环岛酒吧和戴维·德怀恩（David Dewane）小酌之后不久，他提出极乐机（Eudaimonia Machine）的概念。德怀恩是一位建筑学教授，因此喜欢探究概念与实体之间的交集。极乐机恰好是这种交集的一个很好的例子。这种机器原来是一座建筑，名字源自古希腊的“eudaimonia”一词（指能够开发出人体全部潜能的一种状态）概念。“这种机器的目的在于，”戴维解释说，“创造一种环境，让使用者身处其中时可以达到深度人体繁荣状态，即实现达到个人能力极限的成果。”换言之，设计这个空间的唯一目的是实现最深度的深度工作。你或许也能想到，我当时就提起了兴趣。

As Dewane explained the machine to me, he grabbed a pen to sketch its proposed layout. The structure is a one-story narrow rectangle made up of five rooms, placed in a line, one after another. There’s no shared hallway: you have to pass through one room to get to the next. As Dewane explains, “[The lack of circulation] is critical because it doesn’t allow you to bypass any of the spaces as you get deeper into the machine.”

德怀恩一边向我解释这种机器的原理，一边抓起一支笔，画出了布局草图。整个建筑结构是一座一层高的长方形，由 5 个房间组成，一字排开。几个房间没有互相连通的走廊：必须穿过一间房间才能进入到下一间。德怀恩是这样解释的：“互相不连通是关键，因为这样一来，想要深入到机器更里层，你不可能越过任何一点空间。”

The first room you enter when coming off the street is called the gallery. In Dewane’s plan, this room would contain examples of deep work produced in the building. It’s meant to inspire users of the machine, creating a “culture of healthy stress and peer pressure.”

你从大街走进的第一个房间叫作陈列室。在德怀恩的计划中，这个房间里将展示在这座建筑中产出的深度工作案例。旨在激励机器使用者，创造出一种“健康压力和同伴压力的文化”。

As you leave the gallery, you next enter the salon. In here, Dewane imagines access to high-quality coffee and perhaps even a full bar. There are also couches and Wi-Fi. The salon is designed to create a mood that “hovers between intense curiosity and argumentation.” This is a place to debate, “brood,” and in general work through the ideas that you’ll develop deeper in the machine.

离开陈列室之后，你将进入到沙龙。在这里，德怀恩想安排高品质的咖啡馆，甚至可以设一个全品酒吧。这里还有沙发和无线网。沙龙的设计旨在酝酿出一种“徘徊于强烈的好奇和争辩之间”的情绪。这个场所用于争辩和“沉思”，从总体上把控你将在这台机器中深入探究的一些想法。

Beyond the salon you enter the library. This room stores a permanent record of all work produced in the machine, as well as the books and other resources used in this previous work. There will be copiers and scanners for gathering and collecting the information you need for your project. Dewane describes the library as “the hard drive of the machine.”

走过沙龙之后将进入图书馆。这个房间里永久储存了这台机器里产出的所有工作，同时还存有此前工作中使用过的图书和其他资源。房间里有复印机和扫描仪，可以用于搜集整理你的项目所需的信息。德怀恩将图书馆描述为“机器的硬盘”。

The next room is the office space. It contains a standard conference room with a whiteboard and some cubicles with desks. “The office,” Dewane explains, “is for low-intensity activity.” To use our terminology, this is the space to complete the shallow efforts required by your project. Dewane imagines an administrator with a desk in the office who could help its users improve their work habits to optimize their efficiency.

下一个房间是办公空间。房间里有一个标准会议室，有白板和一些带桌子的小隔间。德怀恩解释说：“办公室用于低强度的活动。”用我们的术语讲，这片空间用于完成项目所需的浮浅工作。德怀恩设想办公室里有一张管理员桌，管理员可以帮助使用者改善工作习惯，优化效率。

This brings us to the final room of the machine, a collection of what Dewane calls “deep work chambers” (he adopted the term “deep work” from my articles on the topic). Each chamber is conceived to be six by ten feet and protected by thick soundproof walls (Dewane’s plans call for eighteen inches of insulation). “The purpose of the deep work chamber is to allow for total focus and uninterrupted work flow,” Dewane explains. He imagines a process in which you spend ninety minutes inside, take a ninety-minute break, and repeat two or three times—at which point your brain will have achieved its limit of concentration for the day.

之后我们可以进入机器的最后一个房间了，里面有一些小室，德怀恩将其称作“深度工作室”（他从我的同主题文章中选取了“深度工作”这一说法）。每一个小室拟为 6 英尺×10 英尺大小，有很好的隔音墙保护（德怀恩计划设计的厚度为 18 英寸，以隔绝外部干扰）。“深度工作室的目的在于实现全心投入和无干扰的工作。”德怀恩解释说。他设想你在其中工作 90 分钟，然后休息 90 分钟，如此循环两到三次——此时你的大脑将达到一天专注工作时间的极限。

For now, the Eudaimonia Machine exists only as a collection of architectural drawings, but even as a plan, its potential to support impactful work excites Dewane. “[This design] remains, in my mind, the most interesting piece of architecture I’ve ever produced,” he told me.

眼下，极乐机仅仅是一些建筑图纸，但即使仅仅是一个计划，其实现高效工作的前景也令德怀恩兴奋不已。“在我看来这仍然是我设计过的最有趣的一件作品。”他告诉我说。

In an ideal world—one in which the true value of deep work is accepted and celebrated—we’d all have access to something like the Eudaimonia Machine. Perhaps not David Dewane’s exact design, but, more generally speaking, a work environment (and culture) designed to help us extract as much value as possible from our brains. Unfortunately, this vision is far from our current reality. We instead find ourselves in distracting open offices where inboxes cannot be neglected and meetings are incessant—a setting where colleagues would rather you respond quickly to their latest e-mail than produce the best possible results. As a reader of this book, in other words, you’re a disciple of depth in a shallow world.

在深度工作的真正价值能够得到认可和渴求的理想世界里，我们都有机会接触到某种类似于极乐机的东西。或许和戴维·德怀恩的设计并不完全一样，概括地说，这是一种专门设计的工作环境（和文化），能帮助我们从大脑中提取尽可能多的价值。不幸的是，这种愿景与我们眼前的现实差太远。我们身处令人分神的开放办公室中，收件箱无法忽略，会议不断。在这种环境下，同事宁愿你尽快回复他们最新发的电子邮件而不是产出最好的成果。换言之，作为本书的读者，你们将成为肤浅世界里的深度信徒。

This rule—the first of four such rules in Part 2 of this book—is designed to reduce this conflict. You might not have access to your own Eudaimonia Machine, but the strategies that follow will help you simulate its effects in your otherwise distracted professional life. They’ll show you how to transform deep work from an aspiration into a regular and significant part of your daily schedule. (Rules #2 through #4 will then help you get the most out of this deep work habit by presenting, among other things, strategies for training your concentration ability and fighting back encroaching distractions.)

这一项准则——本书第二部分四种准则中的第一条，旨在减少此类冲突。你或许没有自己的极乐机，但是下述策略将帮助你在相对纷乱的职业生活中模拟出极乐机的效果。文中将向你展示如何将深度工作从一种渴望转变为你日常工作计划中的常规安排和重要组成部分。（准则 2 到准则 4 将展示一些培养专注能力和抵抗无孔不入的烦心事的策略，帮助你从深度工作习惯中获得最大的益处。）

Before proceeding to these strategies, however, I want to first address a question that might be nagging you: Why do we need such involved interventions? Put another way, once you accept that deep work is valuable, isn’t it enough to just start doing more of it? Do we really need something as complicated as the Eudaimonia Machine (or its equivalent) for something as simple as remembering to concentrate more often?

然而，在继续探讨这些策略之前，我想先解决一个或许一直困扰你的问题：为什么我们需要这么深入的干预？换一种说法，一旦你接受了深度工作有价值的观念，开始更多地做到深度工作不就足够了吗？我们真的需要极乐机（或类似的机器）这样复杂的机器来帮助我们记住要更专注这么简单的事情吗？

Unfortunately, when it comes to replacing distraction with focus, matters are not so simple. To understand why this is true let’s take a closer look at one of the main obstacles to going deep: **the urge to turn your attention toward something more superficial**. Most people recognize that this urge can complicate efforts to concentrate on hard things, but most underestimate its regularity and strength.

不幸的是，想要不分心做到专注，问题并不是那么简单。想要理解为什么会这样，我们需要更深入地探究**深度工作的主要障碍之一：将注意力转移到某种肤浅事物上的冲动**。大多数人都能意识到这种冲动会使专注于困难工作的努力变得无效，但是大多数人低估了这种冲动出现的频率及其力量。

Consider a 2012 study, led by psychologists Wilhelm Hofmann and Roy Baumeister, that outfitted 205 adults with beepers that activated at randomly selected times (this is the experience sampling method discussed in Part 1). When the beeper sounded, the subject was asked to pause for a moment to reflect on desires that he or she was currently feeling or had felt in the last thirty minutes, and then answer a set of questions about these desires. After a week, the researchers had gathered more than 7,500 samples. Here’s the short version of what they found: *People fight desires all day long*. As Baumeister summarized in his subsequent book, *Willpower* (co-authored with the science writer John Tierney): “Desire turned out to be the norm, not the exception.”

我们来看心理学家威尔海姆·霍夫曼（Wilhelm Hofmann）和罗伊·鲍迈斯特（Roy Baumeister）在 2012 年牵头进行的一项研究。实验中，205 名成年人配备了传呼机，传呼机会随机响起（在第一部分的抽样法中也有同样的做法）。传呼机响起时，实验对象需要停顿一会儿，回想当时的欲望或过去 30 分钟的感受，然后就这些欲望回答一系列问题。一周之后，研究人员搜集了 7500 多个样本。实验结果简要概括如下：人们整天都在抵抗欲望。鲍迈斯特在后续的著作《意志力》（Willpower）（与科学作家约翰·蒂尔尼联合创作）中如此总结：“结果显示欲望是常态，而非个例。”

The five most common desires these subjects fought include, not surprisingly, eating, sleeping, and sex. But the top five list also included desires for “taking a break from [hard] work… checking e-mail and social networking sites, surfing the web, listening to music, or watching television.” The lure of the Internet and television proved especially strong: The subjects succeeded in resisting these particularly addictive distractions only around half the time.

实验对象抵抗的欲望中最普遍的五种包括吃、睡和性，这些都不足为奇。但是前五榜单中还包括“在困难工作中休息一会儿……查看电子邮件和社交网站，上上网，听听音乐或是看电视”。网络和电视的诱惑力尤其强：实验对象只有大约一半的时间能够成功抵御这些让人上瘾的消遣。

These results are bad news for this rule’s goal of helping you cultivate a deep work habit. They tell us that you can expect to be bombarded with the desire to do anything *but* work deeply throughout the day, and if you’re like the German subjects from the Hofmann and Baumeister study, these competing desires will often win out. You might respond at this point that *you* will succeed where these subjects failed because you understand the importance of depth and will therefore be more rigorous in your will to remain concentrated. This is a noble sentiment, but the decades of research that preceded this study underscore its futility. A now voluminous line of inquiry, initiated in a series of pioneering papers also written by Roy Baumeister, has established the following important (and at the time, unexpected) truth about willpower: *You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it*.

这些研究成果对于我们这条以帮助读者培养深度工作习惯为目标的准则而言，是个坏消息。这项研究告诉我们，一整天你将遭遇各种欲望的连番攻击，除了深入工作之外。而且如果你和霍夫曼、鲍迈斯特的实验中的德国实验对象一样，这些争先涌现的欲望往往能够赢得胜利。此刻你或许会认为，这些实验对象失败的地方你能够成功，因为你理解了深度的重要性，所以会有更强的保持专注的主观意愿。这是一种美好的想法，但是这项实验之前的数十年研究显示这种主观意愿往往是徒劳的。如今大量的调查——罗伊·鲍迈斯特在写作一系列首创论文时发起的——显示出有关意志力的重要事实：你的意志力是有限的，它在使用的过程中会被不断消耗。

Your will, in other words, is not a manifestation of your character that you can deploy without limit; it’s instead like a muscle that tires. This is why the subjects in the Hofmann and Baumeister study had such a hard time fighting desires—over time these distractions drained their finite pool of willpower until they could no longer resist. The same will happen to you, regardless of your intentions—unless, that is, you’re smart about your habits.

换言之，你的意志力并非性格的展现，可以无限制地使用；相反，它恰如肌肉一般，会疲劳。这也是霍夫曼和鲍迈斯特的实验中，实验对象很难抵抗欲望的原因——经过一段时间，这些烦扰会榨干他们的意志力，直到最后无法抵抗。同样的事情也会发生在你身上，不管你的主观意愿如何坚定，除非你很讲究个人习惯。

This brings me to the motivating idea behind the strategies that follow: The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add *routines* and *rituals* to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration. If you suddenly decide, for example, in the middle of a distracted afternoon spent Web browsing, to switch your attention to a cognitively demanding task, you’ll draw heavily from your finite willpower to wrest your attention away from the online shininess. Such attempts will therefore frequently fail. On the other hand, if you deployed smart routines and rituals—perhaps a set time and quiet location used for your deep tasks each afternoon—you’d require much less willpower to start and keep going. In the long run, you’d therefore succeed with these deep efforts far more often.

由此我得出了一种令人振奋的想法：培养深度工作的习惯，关键在于越过良好的意图，在工作生活中加入一些特别设计的惯例和固定程序，使得进入并保持高度专注状态消耗的意志力最小化。如果你在一个浑浑噩噩的下午正浏览网页，忽然想要将注意力转移到一项需要高认知度的任务上，便需要大量抽取有限的意志力，强行将注意力从绚烂的网络内容上转移开。这样的尝试往往以失败告终。但如果你能够布置一些精妙的惯例和固定程序，比如每天下午安排特定的时间或安静的场所用于完成深度任务，就只需很少的意志力便能启动工作并保持下去。从长远看，你会因此更成功地实现深度工作。

With this in mind, the six strategies that follow can be understood as an arsenal of routines and rituals designed with the science of limited willpower in mind to maximize the amount of deep work you consistently accomplish in your schedule. Among other things, they’ll ask you to commit to a particular pattern for scheduling this work and develop rituals to sharpen your concentration before starting each session. Some of these strategies will deploy simple heuristics to hijack your brain’s motivation center while others are designed to recharge your willpower reserves at the fastest possible rate.

基于上述观点，下文中介绍的 6 种策略可以看作惯例和固定程序的弹药库，根据有限意志力的科学设计，旨在最大限度地实现日常安排中的持续深度工作。除此之外，这些方法还要求你按照某一特定的模式筹划一项工作，培养习惯，以确保每一次练习开始之前保持高度专注。这些策略中有一些利用简单的启发法控制你大脑的刺激中枢，另有一些则旨在以最快的速度补充你的意志力。

You could just try to make deep work a priority. But supporting this decision with the strategies that follow—or strategies of your own devising that are motivated by the same principles—will significantly increase the probability that you succeed in making deep work a crucial part of your professional life.

你可以很简单地将深度工作放到优先考虑事项中。但是，利用下述策略，或者由你根据同样的原则设计出来的策略支撑这个决定，将极大提升你将深度工作变成职业生活重要组成部分的可能性。

## Decide on Your Depth Philosophy

The famed computer scientist Donald Knuth cares about deep work. As he explains on his website: “What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration.” A doctoral candidate named Brian Chappell, who is a father with a full-time job, also values deep work, as it’s the only way he can make progress on his dissertation given his limited time. Chappell told me that his first encounter with the idea of deep work was “an emotional moment.”

著名的计算机科学家唐纳德·克努特（Donald Knuth）很关注深度工作。他在个人网站上这样写道：“我所做的事情需要长时间的学习和无人干扰的高度专注。”有一位名为布莱恩·查普尔（Brian Chappell）的博士研究生，他有全职工作，还是一位父亲，他很重视深度工作，因为只有这样他才能在有限的时间里按进度完成博士论文。查普尔告诉我，第一次了解到深度工作的理念时，是“激动人心的一刻”。

I mention these examples because although Knuth and Chappell agree on the importance of depth, they disagree on their *philosophies* for integrating this depth into their work lives. As I’ll detail in the next section, Knuth deploys a form of monasticism that prioritizes deep work by trying to eliminate or minimize all other types of work. Chappell, by contrast, deploys a rhythmic strategy in which he works for the same hours (five to seven thirty a.m.) every weekday morning, without exception, before beginning a workday punctuated by standard distractions. Both approaches work, but not universally. Knuth’s approach might make sense for someone whose primary professional obligation is to think big thoughts, but if Chappell adopted a similar rejection of all things shallow, he’d likely lose his job.

我提及这两个例子是因为尽管克努特和查普尔同样赞同深度的重要性，但是他们将深度融入到工作生活中的哲学却有所不同。克努特采用了一种禁欲生活，优先深度工作，尽量剔除或减少其他所有类型的工作。查普尔则采用一种节奏策略，每个工作日上午开始日常充满分心之事的工作之前，他都在同样的时间段里工作一段时间（上午 5 点至 7 点半），从无例外。这些我都将在下一节中详细论述。两种工作方式都可行，但都非普遍适用。克努特的方法或许适用于主要工作职责在于思考重大事项的人，但是查普尔如果采用同样的策略，拒绝所有浮浅工作，那么他很可能就会丢掉自己的工作。

You need your own philosophy for integrating deep work into your professional life. (As argued in this rule’s introduction, attempting to schedule deep work in an ad hoc fashion is not an effective way to manage your limited willpower.) But this example highlights a general warning about this selection: You must be careful to choose a philosophy that fits your specific circumstances, as a mismatch here can derail your deep work habit before it has a chance to solidify. This strategy will help you avoid this fate by presenting four different depth philosophies that I’ve seen work exceptionally well in practice. The goal is to convince you that there are many different ways to integrate deep work into your schedule, and it’s therefore worth taking the time to find an approach that makes sense for you.

你需要有自己的哲学，将深度工作融入你的职业生活中。（正如我们在本准则的引言中介绍的，尝试用特别的方式安排深度工作，并不能有效地管理你有限的意志力。）但是这个例子强调了做此类选择时应特别注意的问题：你必须精心挑选一种适用于你所处特定环境的哲学，因为不匹配的哲学会让你在深度工作习惯成形之前脱离轨道。这种策略可以帮助你避免同时面对 4 种不同的深度工作哲学（我见证过这 4 种哲学在实践中都有非常好的效果）。说这些的目的在于使你相信，有很多方法可以将深度工作融入你的日常工作日程中，因此值得花时间选择一种对你而言合理的方法。

### The Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling

Let’s return to Donald Knuth. He’s famous for many innovations in computer science, including, notably, the development of a rigorous approach to analyzing algorithm performance. Among his peers, however, Knuth also maintains an aura of infamy for his approach to electronic communication. If you visit Knuth’s website at Stanford with the intention of finding his e-mail address, you’ll instead discover the following note:

我们回到唐纳德·克努特的例子上。他因为在计算机科学领域的多项创新而闻名，其中尤为重要的是开发出严谨的算法分析方法。然而在同行中，克努特也因对电子通讯的使用态度而饱受抱怨。如果你访问克努特在斯坦福大学网站中的个人网页，想要找到他的电子邮箱地址，只会看到下面一条注意事项：

> I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address. I’d used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15 years of email is plenty for one lifetime. Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things. What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration.
>
> 从 1990 年 1 月 1 日起，我成了一个快乐的人，那一天我不再有电子邮箱。我从 1975 年开始使用电子邮箱，在我看来一生用 15 年电子邮箱已经够长了。对于生活中要站到风口浪尖的人而言，电子邮箱是一种奇妙的东西。但对我来说却不是；我的角色是站到背景后。我所做的事情需要长时间的学习和无人干扰的高度专注。

Knuth goes on to acknowledge that he doesn’t intend to cut himself off completely from the world. He notes that writing his books requires communication with thousands of people and that he wants to be responsive to questions and comments. His solution? He provides an address—a *postal mailing* address. He says that his administrative assistant will sort through any letters arriving at that address and put aside those that she thinks are relevant. Anything that’s truly urgent she’ll bring to Knuth promptly, and everything else he’ll handle in a big batch, once every three months or so.

Knuth deploys what I call the *monastic philosophy* of deep work scheduling. This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations. Practitioners of the monastic philosophy tend to have a well-defined and highly valued professional goal that they’re pursuing, and the bulk of their professional success comes from doing this one thing exceptionally well. It’s this clarity that helps them eliminate the thicket of shallow concerns that tend to trip up those whose value proposition in the working world is more varied.

Knuth, for example, explains his professional goal as follows: “I try to learn certain areas of computer science exhaustively; then I try to digest that knowledge into a form that is accessible to people who don’t have time for such study.” Trying to pitch Knuth on the intangible returns of building an audience on Twitter, or the unexpected opportunities that might come through a more liberal use of e-mail, will fail, as these behaviors don’t directly aid his goal to exhaustively understand specific corners of computer science and then write about them in an accessible manner.

Another person committed to monastic deep work is the acclaimed science fiction writer Neal Stephenson. If you visit Stephenson’s author website, you’ll notice a lack of e-mail or mailing address. We can gain insight into this omission from a pair of essays that Stephenson posted on his early website (hosted on The Well) back in the early 2000s, and which have been preserved by the Internet Archive. In one such essay, archived in 2003, Stephenson summarizes his communication policy as follows:

*Persons who wish to interfere with my concentration are politely requested not to do so, and warned that I don’t answer e-mail… lest [my communication policy’s] key message get lost in the verbiage, I will put it here succinctly: All of my time and attention are spoken for—several times over. Please do not ask for them.*

To further justify this policy, Stephenson wrote an essay titled “Why I Am a Bad Correspondent.” At the core of his explanation for his inaccessibility is the following decision:

*The productivity equation is a non-linear one, in other words. This accounts for why I am a bad correspondent and why I very rarely accept speaking engagements. If I organize my life in such a way that I get lots of long, consecutive, uninterrupted time-chunks, I can write novels. But as those chunks get separated and fragmented, my productivity as a novelist drops spectacularly.*

Stephenson sees two mutually exclusive options: He can write good novels at a regular rate, or he can answer a lot of individual e-mails and attend conferences, and as a result produce lower-quality novels at a slower rate. He chose the former option, and this choice requires him to avoid as much as possible any source of shallow work in his professional life. (This issue is so important to Stephenson that he went on to explore its implications—positive and negative—in his 2008 science fiction epic, *Anathem*, which considers a world where an intellectual elite live in monastic orders, isolated from the distracted masses and technology, thinking deep thoughts.)

In my experience, the monastic philosophy makes many knowledge workers defensive. The clarity with which its adherents identify their value to the world, I suspect, touches a raw nerve for those whose contribution to the information economy is more complex. Notice, of course, that “more complex” does not mean “lesser.” A high-level manager, for example, might play a vital role in the functioning of a billion-dollar company, even if she cannot point to something discrete, like a completed novel, and say, “This is what I produced this year.” Therefore, the pool of individuals to whom the monastic philosophy applies is limited—and that’s okay. If you’re outside this pool, its radical simplicity shouldn’t evince too much envy. On the other hand, if you’re inside this pool—someone whose contribution to the world is discrete, clear, and individualized[\*](footnotes.xhtml#fn0006fn)—then you should give this philosophy serious consideration, as it might be the deciding factor between an average career and one that will be remembered.

### The Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling

This book opened with a story about the revolutionary psychologist and thinker Carl Jung. In the 1920s, at the same time that Jung was attempting to break away from the strictures of his mentor, Sigmund Freud, he began regular retreats to a rustic stone house he built in the woods outside the small town of Bollingen. When there, Jung would lock himself every morning into a minimally appointed room to write without interruption. He would then meditate and walk in the woods to clarify his thinking in preparation for the next day’s writing. These efforts, I argued, were aimed at increasing the intensity of Jung’s deep work to a level that would allow him to succeed in intellectual combat with Freud and his many supporters.

In recalling this story I want to emphasize something important: Jung did *not* deploy a monastic approach to deep work. Donald Knuth and Neal Stephenson, our examples from earlier, attempted to completely eliminate distraction and shallowness from their professional lives. Jung, by contrast, sought this elimination only during the periods he spent at his retreat. The rest of Jung’s time was spent in Zurich, where his life was anything but monastic: He ran a busy clinical practice that often had him seeing patients until late at night; he was an active participant in the Zurich coffeehouse culture; and he gave and attended many lectures in the city’s respected universities. (Einstein received his doctorate from one university in Zurich and later taught at another; he also, interestingly enough, knew Jung, and the two shared several dinners to discuss the key ideas of Einstein’s special relativity.) Jung’s life in Zurich, in other words, is similar in many ways to the modern archetype of the hyperconnected digital-age knowledge worker: Replace “Zurich” with “San Francisco” and “letter” with “tweet” and we could be discussing some hotshot tech CEO.

Jung’s approach is what I call the *bimodal philosophy* of deep work. This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically—seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. This division of time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales. For example, on the scale of a week, you might dedicate a four-day weekend to depth and the rest to open time. Similarly, on the scale of a year, you might dedicate one season to contain most of your deep stretches (as many academics do over the summer or while on sabbatical).

The bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can produce extreme productivity, *but only if* the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavors to reach maximum cognitive intensity—the state in which real breakthroughs occur. This is why the minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day. To put aside a few hours in the morning, for example, is too short to count as a deep work stretch for an adherent of this approach.

At the same time, the bimodal philosophy is typically deployed by people who cannot succeed in the absence of substantial commitments to non-deep pursuits. Jung, for example, needed his clinical practice to pay the bills and the Zurich coffeehouse scene to stimulate his thinking. The approach of shifting between two modes provides a way to serve both needs well.

To provide a more modern example of the bimodal philosophy in action, we can once again consider Adam Grant, the Wharton Business School professor whose thoughtfulness about work habits was first introduced in Part 1. As you might recall, Grant’s schedule during his rapid rise through the professorship ranks at Wharton provides a nice bimodality case study. On the scale of the academic year, he stacked his courses into one semester, so that he could focus the other on deep work. During these deep semesters he then applied the bimodal approach on the weekly scale. He would, perhaps once or twice a month, take a period of two to four days to become completely monastic. He would shut his door, put an out-of-office auto-responder on his e-mail, and work on his research without interruption. Outside of these deep sessions, Grant remained famously open and accessible. In some sense, he had to be: His 2013 bestseller, *Give and Take*, promotes the practice of giving of your time and attention, without expectation of something in return, as a key strategy in professional advancement.

Those who deploy the bimodal philosophy of deep work admire the productivity of the monastics but also respect the value they receive from the shallow behaviors in their working lives. Perhaps the biggest obstacle to implementing this philosophy is that even short periods of deep work require a flexibility that many fear they lack in their current positions. If even an hour away from your inbox makes you uncomfortable, then certainly the idea of disappearing for a day or more at a time will seem impossible. But I suspect bimodal working is compatible with more types of jobs than you might guess. Earlier, for example, I described a study by Harvard Business School professor Leslie Perlow. In this study, a group of management consultants were asked to disconnect for a full day each workweek. The consultants were afraid the client would rebel. It turned out that the client didn’t care. As Jung, Grant, and Perlow’s subjects discovered, people will usually respect your right to become inaccessible if these periods are well defined and well advertised, and outside these stretches, you’re once again easy to find.

### The Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling

In the early days of the *Seinfeld* show, Jerry Seinfeld remained a working comic with a busy tour schedule. It was during this period that a writer and comic named Brad Isaac, who was working open mic nights at the time, ran into Seinfeld at a club waiting to go on stage. As Isaac later explained in a now classic Lifehacker article: “I saw my chance. I had to ask Seinfeld if he had any tips for a young comic. What he told me was something that would benefit me for a lifetime.”

在《宋飞正传》（Seinfeld）上映初期，杰瑞·宋飞还是个普通的喜剧演员，有忙碌的巡演计划。恰在这段时间里，一位名为布莱德·埃塞克（Brad Isaac）的作家、喜剧演员正在组织开麦之夜[③](#footnote3)，他在一家酒吧遇到准备上台表演的宋飞。埃塞克后来在一篇经典的生活黑客（Life hacker）文章中解释说：“我看到了机会。我必须问问宋飞有没有给年轻喜剧演员的好建议。他告诉我的事情将使我受益一生。”

Seinfeld began his advice to Isaac with some common sense, noting “the way to be a better comic was to create better jokes,” and then explaining that the way to create better jokes was to write every day. Seinfeld continued by describing a specific technique he used to help maintain this discipline. He keeps a calendar on his wall. Every day that he writes jokes he crosses out the date on the calendar with a big red *X*. “After a few days you’ll have a chain,” Seinfeld said. “Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You’ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.”

宋飞给埃塞克的建议以一些惯常的内容开始，提及“成为优秀的喜剧演员就是要创作出更好的笑话”，而后又解释说，想要写出更好的笑话就要每天都写。宋飞接着介绍了用于律己的一种特别技巧。他在墙上挂了一本日历。每天他写过笑话就会在日历的这一天上划上一个大大的红 X。“过几天你就能连成一条链子。”宋飞说，“只需保持下去，这条链子每天都会变得更长。你会喜欢上看这条链子，特别是有一定经验之后。你下一步需要做的事就是不要让这个链子断掉。”

This *chain method* (as some now call it) soon became a hit among writers and fitness enthusiasts—communities that thrive on the ability to do hard things consistently. For our purposes, it provides a specific example of a general approach to integrating depth into your life: the *rhythmic philosophy*. This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit. The goal, in other words, is to generate a *rhythm* for this work that removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you’re going to go deep. The chain method is a good example of the rhythmic philosophy of deep work scheduling because it combines a simple scheduling heuristic (do the work every day), with an easy way to remind yourself to do the work: the big red *X*s on the calendar.

这种链条法（有些人这么叫）很快在作家和发烧友——追求持续完成高难度事务能力的群体——中风行起来。从本书的目的来看，这恰恰提供了一种将深度整合到生活中的普遍方法：节奏哲学。这种哲学认为轻松启动深度工作的最好方法就是将其转化成一种简单的常规习惯。换言之，其目标是创造一种工作节奏，让你不需要你投入精力便可以决定是否需要以及何时需要进入深度状态。链条法是节奏哲学深度工作日程安排的典型例子，因为这种方法结合了一种简单的启发式调度（每天都要做这项工作）和一种提醒你做这项工作的简单方法：日历上的大红 X。

Another common way to implement the rhythmic philosophy is to replace the visual aid of the chain method with a set starting time that you use every day for deep work. In much the same way that maintaining visual indicators of your work progress can reduce the barrier to entry for going deep, eliminating even the simplest scheduling decisions, such as when during the day to do the work, also reduces this barrier.

实施节奏哲学的另外一种常见方式是拿掉链条法中的视觉辅助工具，转而设定一个启动时间，每天在这个时间开始深度工作。恰如视觉工具提醒工作进展可以降低进入深度状态的门槛，剔除诸如每天何时工作等最简单的日程安排决定，也可以降低这种门槛。

Consider the example of Brian Chappell, the busy doctoral candidate I introduced in the opening to this strategy. Chappell adopted the rhythmic philosophy of deep work scheduling out of necessity. Around the time that he was ramping up his dissertation writing he was offered a full-time job at a center on the campus where he was a student. Professionally, this was a good opportunity and Chappell was happy to accept it. But academically, a full-time job, especially when coupled with the recent arrival of Chappell’s first child, made it difficult to find the depth needed to write thesis chapters.

回顾我们引入这种策略开始时介绍的忙碌博士研究生布莱恩·查普尔。查普尔因实际需要采用了节奏哲学。在他努力完成论文的阶段，他就读学校的一个中心为他提供了一份全职工作。从职业角度讲，这是一个好机会，查普尔也很愿意接受。但从学术角度讲，一份全职工作，特别是查普尔的第一个孩子也刚降生，使他很难找到时间深入完成论文的写作。

Chappell began by attempting a vague commitment to deep work. He made a rule that deep work needed to happen in ninety-minute chunks (recognizing correctly that it takes time to ease into a state of concentration) and he decided he would try to schedule these chunks in an ad hoc manner whenever appropriate openings in his schedule arose. Not surprisingly, this strategy didn’t yield much productivity. In a dissertation boot camp Chappell had attended the year before, he’d managed to produce a full thesis chapter in a single week of rigorous deep work. After he accepted his full-time job, he managed to produce only a single additional chapter in *the entire first year* he was working.

查普尔开始摸索着尝试深度工作。他定下原则，深度工作必须在 90 分钟的时间段里才能实现（这点认识是正确的，因为要逐步进入专注的状态需要一定的时间），并决定他将努力在恰当的时机挑出专门的时间开始深度工作。这种策略并没有带来太好的成效。查普尔此前一年参加了一次论文训练营，经过一周高强度的深度工作，完成了论文的一个完整章节。接受了全职工作之后，他整整用了工作第一年全年的时间，才又完成了一个章节。

It was the glacial writing progress during this year that drove Chappell to embrace the rhythmic method. He made a rule that he would wake up and start working by five thirty every morning. He would then work until seven thirty, make breakfast, and go to work already done with his dissertation obligations for the day. Pleased by early progress, he soon pushed his wake-up time to four forty-five to squeeze out even more morning depth.

这一年缓慢的写作进展驱使查普尔接纳了节奏法。他定下规则，每天早晨 5 点半起床工作。他会一直工作到 7 点半，做早餐，然后去上班，当日的论文写作任务已经完成。他对最初的进展很满意，很快将起床时间提前到 4 点 45 分，挤出了更多的清晨深度时间。

When I interviewed Chappell for this book, he described his rhythmic approach to deep work scheduling as “both astronomically productive and guilt free.” His routine was producing four to five pages of academic prose per day and was capable of generating drafts of thesis chapters at a rate of one chapter *every two or three weeks*: a phenomenal output for someone who also worked a nine-to-five job. “Who’s to say that I can’t be that prolific?” he concluded. “Why not me?”

我为写作本书采访查普尔时，他将节奏法描述为“既极为高效，又不会令人心怀愧疚”。他每日惯例是完成 4～5 页的学术论文写作，能够做到每 2～3 周完成一个章节的草稿：对于一个还要朝九晚五工作的人来说，这是非常罕见的产出。“谁说我不能多产？”他总结说，“为什么说我不行？”

The rhythmic philosophy provides an interesting contrast to the bimodal philosophy. It perhaps fails to achieve the most intense levels of deep thinking sought in the daylong concentration sessions favored by the bimodalist. The trade-off, however, is that this approach works better with the reality of human nature. By supporting deep work with rock-solid routines that make sure a little bit gets done on a regular basis, the rhythmic scheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours per year.

节奏哲学与双峰哲学形成了一种有趣的对比。节奏哲学下或许难以达到双峰哲学追随者喜好的最高强度深度思考。然而，这种方法的好处在于更符合人类的真实天性。节奏日程安排者通过雷打不动的惯例支持深度工作，确保能够定期完成一定的工作，在一年的时间里往往能够累积更多的深度工作时长。

The decision between rhythmic and bimodal can come down to your self-control in such scheduling matters. If you’re Carl Jung and are engaged in an intellectual dogfight with Sigmund Freud’s supporters, you’ll likely have no trouble recognizing the importance of finding time to focus on your ideas. On the other hand, if you’re writing a dissertation with no one pressuring you to get it done, the habitual nature of the rhythmic philosophy might be necessary to maintain progress.

如何选择节奏法和双峰法，取决于你在此类日程安排方面的自控能力。如果你是卡尔·荣格，要与西格蒙德·弗洛伊德的支持者进行论战，应该很容易就能意识到找出时间专注于个人想法的重要性。另一方面，如果你要写作论文，但并没有人给你压力去完成这项工作，那么节奏哲学的习惯性特征或许对于保持进度就更必要了。

For many, however, it’s not just self-control issues that bias them toward the rhythmic philosophy, but also the reality that some jobs don’t allow you to disappear for days at a time when the need to go deep arises. (For a lot of bosses, the standard is that you’re free to focus as hard as you want… so long as the boss’s e-mails are still answered promptly.) This is likely the biggest reason why the rhythmic philosophy is one of the most common among deep workers in standard office jobs.

然而，对于很多人来说，并非因为自控原因才倾向于选择节奏哲学，而是由于现实中某些工作的确不允许你在需要深入的时候一连消失几天。（对于很多老板而言，底线在于，随便你多么专注都好……只要老板的电子邮件能及时回复就可以。）这或许也是在常规办公室工作的深度工作者最常选择节奏哲学的原因吧。

### The Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling

In the 1980s, the journalist Walter Isaacson was in his thirties and well along in his rapid ascent through the ranks of *Time* magazine. By this point, he was undoubtedly on the radar of the thinking class. Christopher Hitchens, for example, writing in the *London Review of Books* during this period, called him “one of the best magazine journalists in America.” The time was right for Isaacson to write a Big Important Book—a necessary step on the ladder of journalistic achievement. So Isaacson chose a complicated topic, an intertwined narrative biography of six figures who played an important role in early Cold War policy, and teamed up with a fellow young *Time* editor, Evan Thomas, to produce an appropriately weighty book: an 864-page epic titled *The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made*.

20 世纪 80 年代，记者沃尔特·艾萨克森（Walter Isaacson）三十多岁，在《时代周刊》正处于职业快速上升期。这个时候，他毫无疑问已经进入了思想界的视野。克里斯托弗·希钦斯（Christopher Hitchens）在这段时间为《伦敦书评》（London Review of Books）写的一篇文章中将他称作“美国最优秀的杂志记者之一”。艾萨克森认为是时候写一本大部头的重要著作了，这是记者成功路途上的必经一步。于是艾萨克森选择了一个非常复杂的主题，在冷战早期政策中起到非常重要作用的六个人的叙述传记，他与《时代周刊》一位年轻的编辑伊万·托马斯（Evan Thomas）合作，创作出一部相当有分量的书：一本 864 页的史诗巨著，名为《聪敏人：六个朋友和他们创造的世界》（The Wise Men：Six Friends and the World They Made）。

This book, which was published in 1986, was well received by the right people. The *New York Times* called it “a richly textured account,” while the *San Francisco Chronicle* exulted that the two young writers had “fashioned a Cold War Plutarch.” Less than a decade later, Isaacson reached the apex of his journalism career when he was appointed editor of *Time* (which he then followed with a second act as the CEO of a think tank and an incredibly popular biographer of figures including Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, and Steve Jobs).

这本书出版于 1986 年，在受众人群中反响很好。《纽约时报》将其称作“结构丰富的传记”，而《旧金山纪事报》则异常欣喜于这样两位年轻的作家写就了“普斯塔克式的冷战史”。不到 10 年，艾萨克森达到记者生涯的顶峰，受聘为《时代周刊》编辑（后来又担起了一家智囊团的首席执行官职位，同时还作为流行传记作家写就了本杰明·富兰克林、阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦和史蒂芬·乔布斯的传记）。

What interests me about Isaacson, however, is not *what* he accomplished with his first book but *how* he wrote it. In uncovering this story, I must draw from a fortunate personal connection. As it turns out, in the years leading up to the publication of *The Wise Men*, my uncle John Paul Newport, who was also a journalist in New York at the time, shared a summer beach rental with Isaacson. To this day, my uncle remembers Isaacson’s impressive work habits:

然而，艾萨克斯真正令我感兴趣的并不是他第一部著作所取得的成就，而是他如何写作这本书的。我也是因偶然的机会通过私人关系了解到了这个不为人知的故事。我后来发现，在《聪敏人》筹划出版那几年里，我的叔叔约翰·保罗·纽波特也在纽约做记者工作，恰好和艾萨克斯同租了一套夏季海滨度假房。直到今天，我的叔叔还对艾萨克斯的工作习惯记忆犹新：

> It was always amazing… he could retreat up to the bedroom for a while, when the rest of us were chilling on the patio or whatever, to work on his book… he’d go up for twenty minutes or an hour, we’d hear the typewriter pounding, then he’d come down as relaxed as the rest of us… the work never seemed to faze him, he just happily went up to work when he had the spare time.
>
> 一直都很令人惊诧……他会退回到自己的卧室用上一段时间写书，而我们其余人则在露台或别的什么地方闲聊……他会在楼上待 20 分钟或 1 小时，我们能听到打字机的声音，然后他会像我们余下所有人一样轻松地走下楼……工作似乎从来都不会搅乱他的节奏，只要有空闲时间，他就会愉快地到楼上工作。

Isaacson was methodic: Any time he could find some free time, he would switch into a deep work mode and hammer away at his book. This is how, it turns out, one can write a nine-hundred-page book on the side while spending the bulk of one’s day becoming one of the country’s best magazine writers.

艾萨克斯很有条理：只要有空闲时间，他就能立刻转入深度工作模式，苦心打磨他那本书。也正是因为这个原因，他才能在写就一本 900 页书的同时，用去每天大部分的时间做记者，成为（美国）全国最优秀的杂志记者之一。

I call this approach, in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule, the *journalist philosophy*. This name is a nod to the fact that journalists, like Walter Isaacson, are trained to shift into a writing mode on a moment’s notice, as is required by the deadline-driven nature of their profession.

我将这种在日程安排中随时可插入深度工作的方法称作记者哲学。这个名称是对沃尔特·艾萨克森一类记者的认可，他们经过训练可以随时转入到写作模式，因为他们的工作中经常要面对截稿期的催促。

This approach is not for the deep work novice. As I established in the opening to this rule, the ability to rapidly switch your mind from shallow to deep mode doesn’t come naturally. Without practice, such switches can seriously deplete your finite willpower reserves. This habit also requires a sense of confidence in your abilities—a conviction that what you’re doing is important and will succeed. This type of conviction is typically built on a foundation of existing professional accomplishment. Isaacson, for example, likely had an easier time switching to writing mode than, say, a first-time novelist, because Isaacson had worked himself up to become a respected writer by this point. He *knew* he had the capacity to write an epic biography and understood it to be a key task in his professional advancement. This confidence goes a long way in motivating hard efforts.

这种方法并不适用于深度工作的新手。正如我在本准则的开头所述，使头脑迅速从浮浅转入深度模式的能力并非自然得来。未经练习，这种转换可能会严重削弱你有限的意志力储备。这种习惯同时还需要你对自己的能力有信心——坚信自己所做之事是重要的而且将会成功。这种坚定的信念往往建立在已取得的职业成就基础之上。比如艾萨克森就比一名新手小说家更容易转入写作模式，因为艾萨克森此时已经成为一名受尊重的作家，他知道自己有能力写出一部史诗级的传记，也懂得这将成为他职业道路上的一项关键任务。这种自信对于激励艰苦的努力会有很大的作用。

I’m partial to the journalistic philosophy of deep work because it’s my main approach to integrating these efforts into my schedule. In other words, I’m not monastic in my deep work (though I do find myself occasionally jealous of my fellow computer scientist Donald Knuth’s unapologetic disconnection), I don’t deploy multiday depth binges like the bimodalists, and though I am intrigued by the rhythmic philosophy, my schedule has a way of thwarting attempts to enforce a daily habit. Instead, in an ode to Isaacson, I face each week as it arrives and do my best to squeeze out as much depth as possible. To write this book, for example, I had to take advantage of free stretches of time wherever they popped up. If my kids were taking a good nap, I’d grab my laptop and lock myself in the home office. If my wife wanted to visit her parents in nearby Annapolis on a weekend day, I’d take advantage of the extra child care to disappear to a quiet corner of their house to write. If a meeting at work was canceled, or an afternoon left open, I might retreat to one of my favorite libraries on campus to squeeze out a few hundred more words. And so on.

我个人也偏爱记者哲学的深度工作，因为这也是我将各项工作安排到日程中所采用的主要方法。换言之，我在深度工作中不是禁欲主义（尽管偶尔我也会嫉妒同行计算机科学家唐纳德·克努特完全与世隔绝但却不用心怀歉意），我也不会像双峰主义者一样接连安排多天的深度工作时间，此外，尽管我很有兴趣采用节奏哲学，但是我的日程安排已经很满，没办法压缩出时间施行这种习惯。我更多的时候如艾萨克森一样，面对每周的工作，竭尽可能压缩出更多的深度工作时间。比如，写作本书的过程中，我会充分利用任何一小段空闲时间。如果我的孩子睡着了，我就会拿出笔记本，把自己锁到书房里。如果妻子在周末要去附近的安纳波利斯拜访她的父母，我就会抓住有额外的人照看孩子的机会，躲到他们房子的一个安静角落去写作。如果工作中有一次会议取消了，或是下午没有安排，我就会来到学校里最喜欢的一间图书馆里，写上几百个词。诸如此类。

I should admit that I’m not pure in my application of the journalist philosophy. I don’t, for example, make all my deep work decisions on a moment-to-moment basis. I instead tend to map out when I’ll work deeply during each week at the beginning of the week, and then refine these decisions, as needed, at the beginning of each day (see Rule #4 for more details on my scheduling routines). By reducing the need to make decisions about deep work moment by moment, I can preserve more mental energy for the deep thinking itself.

我要承认，自己并没有彻底采用记者哲学。比如，我不会临时决定所有的深度工作。我通常会在每周开始的时候制定计划，决定一周的哪些时候要深度工作，然后再在每天开始的时候根据需要调整决定（想了解我是如何制定惯例计划的，参见准则 4）。我减少了临时决定是否做深度工作的次数，因此保留了更多的心理能量用于深度思考。

In the final accounting, the journalistic philosophy of deep work scheduling remains difficult to pull off. But if you’re confident in the value of what you’re trying to produce, and practiced in the skill of going deep (a skill we will continue to develop in the strategies that follow), it can be a surprisingly robust way to squeeze out large amounts of depth from an otherwise demanding schedule.

最后还要提一点，记者哲学的深度工作日程安排是很难办到的。如果你对自己从事的工作价值有足够的信心，实现深度工作的技能也足够熟练（我们将在后续策略中继续探究这种技能），记者哲学将是一种出乎寻常的好办法，能帮助你在紧密的日程安排中挤出大量的深度工作时间。

## Ritualize

An often-overlooked observation about those who use their minds to create valuable things is that they’re rarely haphazard in their work habits. Consider the Pulitzer Prize–winning biographer Robert Caro. As revealed in a 2009 magazine profile, “every inch of [Caro’s] New York office is governed by rules.” Where he places his books, how he stacks his notebooks, what he puts on his wall, even what he wears to the office: Everything is specified by a routine that has varied little over Caro’s long career. “I trained myself to be organized,” he explained.

人们对于那些利用头脑创造有价值事物的人经常忽略的是，他们很少会打乱自己的工作习惯。我们来看看普利策奖获得者、传记作家罗伯特·卡罗（Robert Caro）的例子。2009 年的一份杂志档案透露“卡罗纽约办公室的每一英寸空间都是按规则来布置的”。他放书的位置，他堆放笔记本的方法，在墙上张贴的东西，甚至穿什么衣服到办公室也都一样：所有一切都形成了特定的习惯，在卡罗的漫长职业生涯中只有很小的变化。“我培养自己变得有条不紊。”他解释说。

Charles Darwin had a similarly strict structure for his working life during the period when he was perfecting *On the Origin of Species.* As his son Francis later remembered, he would rise promptly at seven to take a short walk. He would then eat breakfast alone and retire to his study from eight to nine thirty. The next hour was dedicated to reading his letters from the day before, after which he would return to his study from ten thirty until noon. After this session, he would mull over challenging ideas while walking on a prescribed route that started at his greenhouse and then circled a path on his property. He would walk until satisfied with his thinking then declare his workday done.

查尔斯·达尔文（Charles Darwin）在雕琢《物种起源》期间也保持着类似的严格工作安排。他的儿子弗朗西斯后来回忆，达尔文每天早上 7 点准时起床，然后去散一会儿步。然后他会独自用早餐，从 8 点到 9 点半在书房工作。之后的一小时用于拆阅前一天的信件，而后从 10 点半到中午又会回到书房工作。经过这样一段工作之后，他会沿着既定的路线从花房开始，沿房周围的路走圈，深入思考一些具有挑战性的想法。直到想出满意的答案他才会停下来，宣告一天工作的结束。

The journalist Mason Currey, who spent half a decade cataloging the habits of famous thinkers and writers (and from whom I learned the previous two examples), summarized this tendency toward systematization as follows:

记者曼森·卡里用了 5 年的时间编录著名思想家和作家的习惯（也是通过他整理的资料我才了解到上述两个例子），他总结了这种系统化倾向：

> There is a popular notion that artists work from inspiration—that there is some strike or bolt or bubbling up of creative mojo from who knows where… but I hope [my work] makes clear that waiting for inspiration to strike is a terrible, terrible plan. In fact, perhaps the single best piece of advice I can offer to anyone trying to do creative work is to ignore inspiration.
>
> 有一种很普遍的认识，认为艺术家的工作靠的是灵感——不知从何而来的创意魔法让你灵机一动，灵光一闪，才思泉涌……但是我希望我的作品可以使大家明白，等待灵感来袭是非常非常糟糕的计划。事实上，我能给出的最好的建议或许就是，任何做创造性工作的人都应忽略灵感。

In a *New York Times* column on the topic, David Brooks summarizes this reality more bluntly: “[Great creative minds] think like artists but work like accountants.”

在《纽约时报》的同主题专栏中，大卫·布鲁克斯（David Brooks）用更坦率的方式总结了这种现状：“伟大的创造性头脑如艺术家般思考，却如会计般工作。”

This strategy suggests the following: To make the most out of your deep work sessions, build rituals of the same level of strictness and idiosyncrasy as the important thinkers mentioned previously. There’s a good reason for this mimicry. Great minds like Caro and Darwin didn’t deploy rituals to be weird; they did so because success in their work depended on their ability to go deep, again and again—there’s no way to win a Pulitzer Prize or conceive a grand theory without pushing your brain to its limit. Their rituals minimized the friction in this transition to depth, allowing them to go deep more easily and stay in the state longer. If they had instead waited for inspiration to strike before settling in to serious work, their accomplishments would likely have been greatly reduced.

这项策略提出如下的建议：要想使深度工作的效果最大化，就需要养成像前述的重要思想家一样严格内化的习惯。卡罗和达尔文这类伟大的思想家养成习惯并非为了特立独行，而是因为他们工作的成功依赖于不断进入深度状态的能力——如果不将大脑开发到极限就不可能获得普利策奖或是孕育出宏大的理论。他们的习惯使过渡到深度工作状态的阻力压缩到最小，使他们能够更轻松地进入深度状态并保持更长的时间。如果他们等待灵感降临之后再开始认真工作，成就很可能会大幅降低。

There’s no one *correct* deep work ritual—the right fit depends on both the person and the type of project pursued. But there are some general questions that any effective ritual must address:

没有哪一种深度工作习惯是绝对正确的——一种习惯是否合适取决于个人，同时也取决于从事的项目类型。但是这里有一些所有高效习惯都应注意的普遍问题：

- **Where you’ll work and for how long**. Your ritual needs to specify a location for your deep work efforts. This location can be as simple as your normal office with the door shut and desk cleaned off (a colleague of mine likes to put a hotel-style “do not disturb” sign on his office door when he’s tackling something difficult). If it’s possible to identify a location used *only* for depth—for instance, a conference room or quiet library—the positive effect can be even greater. (If you work in an open office plan, this need to find a deep work retreat becomes particularly important.) Regardless of where you work, be sure to also give yourself a specific time frame to keep the session a discrete challenge and not an open-ended slog.

  **你将在何处工作，工作时间多长**。你的习惯中需要指定一个深度工作的场所。场所可以是你正常办公的地方，只需把门关上，桌子清理干净（我有一位同事在处理有难度的问题时，习惯在办公室门把手上挂一个酒店式的“不要打扰”标签）。如果可能的话，找到一个专门用于深度工作的场所——比如，会议室或安静的图书馆——这样积极的效果会更加明显。（如果你在开放式办公室工作，找一个深度工作处所就非常重要了。）不管你在何处工作，都要设定一个具体的时间框架，将这个过程保持为一个离散型的挑战，而非漫无尽头，无休无止。

- **How you’ll work once you start to work**. Your ritual needs rules and processes to keep your efforts structured. For example, you might institute a ban on any Internet use, or maintain a metric such as words produced per twenty-minute interval to keep your concentration honed. Without this structure, you’ll have to mentally litigate again and again what you should and should not be doing during these sessions and keep trying to assess whether you’re working sufficiently hard. These are unnecessary drains on your willpower reserves.

  **工作开始之后你将如何继续工作**。你的习惯需要规则和程序，确保你的努力具有结构性。比如，你可以约定不准使用任何网络，或设定每 20 分钟间隔产出的文字数量，以保持持续专注。如果没有这种结构，你的头脑就需要一遍又一遍地审视自己在深度工作期间应该做什么，不应该做什么，需要不断地评估自己的工作深度是否足够。这些都是对意志力的不必要的浪费。

- **How you’ll support your work**. Your ritual needs to ensure your brain gets the support it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth. For example, the ritual might specify that you start with a cup of good coffee, or make sure you have access to enough food of the right type to maintain energy, or integrate light exercise such as walking to help keep the mind clear. (As Nietzsche said: “It is only ideas gained from walking that have any worth.”) This support might also include environmental factors, such as organizing the raw materials of your work to minimize energy-dissipating friction (as we saw with Caro’s example). To maximize your success, you need to support your efforts to go deep. At the same time, this support needs to be systematized so that you don’t waste mental energy figuring out what you need in the moment.

  **你如何支持自己的工作**。你的习惯要确保大脑能够得到必要的支持，以便保持大脑在高深度水平下运转。比如，你可以设定以一杯上好的咖啡开始工作，或是确保能够获得足够的让你保持能量的食物，或是包含诸如散步之类的轻度活动，帮助大脑保持清醒。（正如尼采所说：“只有散步中得到的想法才是有价值的。”）此类支持或许还包括环境因素，比如工作原材料整理得井井有条，使精力耗费降到最低（如我们在卡罗的例子中看到的一样）。要使你的成功最大化，就需要为自己进入深度的努力提供支持。与此同时，这种支持也需要系统化，这样你才不会浪费心理能量去理清某个时刻需要做什么。

These questions will help you get started in crafting your deep work ritual. But keep in mind that finding a ritual that sticks might require experimentation, so be willing to work at it. I assure you that the effort’s worth it: Once you’ve evolved something that feels right, the impact can be significant. To work deeply is a big deal and should not be an activity undertaken lightly. Surrounding such efforts with a complicated (and perhaps, to the outside world, quite strange) ritual accepts this reality—providing your mind with the structure and commitment it needs to slip into the state of focus where you can begin to create things that matter.

这些问题将帮助你打磨自己的深度工作习惯。但是要记住，找到自己的习惯需要实验尝试，因此要乐于去做。我向你保证，这样的努力是值得的：一旦你培养出正确的习惯，影响将极为深远。深度工作是一件大事，不应草率了事。在深度工作周围包裹复杂的（或许在外人看来很奇怪）习惯恰是对这种现实的接纳——要设定结构性，做出承诺，使大脑能够进入专注状态，这样你才能开始创造真正有意义的事情。

## Make Grand Gestures

In the early winter of 2007, J.K. Rowling was struggling to complete *The Deathly Hallows*, the final book in her Harry Potter series. The pressure was intense, as this book bore the responsibility of tying together the six that preceded it in a way that would satisfy the series’ hundreds of millions of fans. Rowling needed to work deeply to satisfy these demands, but she was finding unbroken concentration increasingly difficult to achieve at her home office in Edinburgh, Scotland. “As I was finishing *Deathly Hallows* there came a day where the window cleaner came, the kids were at home, the dogs were barking,” Rowling recalled in an interview. It was too much, so J.K. Rowling decided to do something extreme to shift her mind-set where it needed to be: She checked into a suite in the five-star Balmoral Hotel, located in the heart of downtown Edinburgh. “So I came to this hotel because it’s a beautiful hotel, but I didn’t intend to stay here,” she explained. “[But] the first day’s writing went well so I kept coming back… and I ended up finishing the last of the *Harry Potter* books [here].”

2007 年初冬，J.K.罗琳正努力完成哈利·波特系列最后一部《死亡圣器》（The Deathly Hallows）。她的压力很大，因为这本书要串联起此前的 6 本书，满足数亿粉丝的期望。罗琳需要深度工作才能达到这些要求，但是她发现在苏格兰爱丁堡的家庭办公室中越来越难做到全神贯注了。“我正在努力完成《死亡圣器》的过程中，有一天擦窗户的人来了，孩子也都在家，几只狗也都叫了起来。”罗琳在一次采访中回忆说。干扰实在太多，于是 J.K.罗琳决定做一点极端的事情，将大脑关注点转移到应有的方向：她入住了爱丁堡市中心的五星巴尔默勒尔酒店（Balmoral Hotel）套房。“我入住这家酒店是因为它很漂亮，但是当时并没有想一直待在那里。”她解释说，“但是第一天的写作完成得非常顺利，于是我就不断回来住到这里……最后在这里完成了《哈利·波特》的最后一本书。”

In retrospect, it’s not surprising that Rowling ended up staying. The setting was perfect for her project. The Balmoral, known as one of Scotland’s most luxurious hotels, is a classic Victorian building complete with ornate stonework and a tall clock tower. It’s also located only a couple of blocks away from Edinburgh Castle—one of Rowling’s inspirations in dreaming up Hogwarts.

回想一下，也难怪罗琳最后会住进这家酒店。酒店环境对她所做的项目来说非常完美。巴尔默勒尔酒店是苏格兰最奢华的酒店之一，经典的维多利亚时代建筑，装饰着华丽的石雕和一座高高的钟塔。而且这座酒店距离爱丁堡城堡也只有几个街区远——这座城堡恰恰是罗琳写出霍格沃茨魔法学校（Hogwarts）的灵感之源。

Rowling’s decision to check into a luxurious hotel suite near Edinburgh Castle is an example of a curious but effective strategy in the world of deep work: *the grand gesture*. The concept is simple: By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task. This boost in importance reduces your mind’s instinct to procrastinate and delivers an injection of motivation and energy.

罗琳决定入住爱丁堡城堡附近的一家豪华酒店套房，在深度工作的世界里是一种有趣但却有效的策略：要有大手笔。这个理念很简单：对周围惯常环境做出巨大改变，辅以可观的精力或金钱投入，都只为支持一项深度工作任务，由此你也提升了这项任务的外现重要性。这种重要性的提升，降低了你的大脑继续拖延的本能，并注入了激励和能量。

Writing a chapter of a Harry Potter novel, for example, is hard work and will require a lot of mental energy—regardless of where you do it. But when paying more than $1,000 a day to write the chapter in a suite of an old hotel down the street from a Hogwarts-style castle, *mustering* the energy to begin and sustain this work is easier than if you were instead in a distracting home office.

比如，写作一章哈利·波特小说是很难的工作，需要大量的心理能量投入，不管你在哪里做这项工作都是一样。但是当你每天付 1000 美元，在一家距离霍格沃茨魔法学校式古堡几个街区的古老酒店的套间中写作时，与在充满干扰的家庭办公室中相比，控制心理能量开始并坚持这项工作要容易许多。

When you study the habits of other well-known deep workers, the grand gesture strategy comes up often. Bill Gates, for example, was famous during his time as Microsoft CEO for taking Think Weeks during which he would leave behind his normal work and family obligations to retreat to a cabin with a stack of papers and books. His goal was to think deeply, without distraction, about the big issues relevant to his company. It was during one of these weeks, for example, that he famously came to the conclusion that the Internet was going to be a major force in the industry. There was nothing physically stopping Gates from thinking deeply in his office in Microsoft’s Seattle headquarters, but the novelty of his weeklong retreat helped him achieve the desired levels of concentration.

当你研究其他著名深度工作者的习惯时，大手笔策略经常会出现。比尔·盖茨任微软首席执行官期间的“思考周”习惯就广为人知。在思考周里，他会暂时放下日常工作和家庭责任，带上一堆白纸和书，隐居到一间小屋里。他的目的是拒绝任何打扰，深度思考与公司相关的重大事务。正是在一次思考周中，他提出网络将成为行业的主要动力这一著名论断。在微软西雅图总部办公室里，并没有什么能从身体上妨碍盖茨深度思考，但是这种新奇的一周隐居生活帮助他达到了期望的专注水平。

The MIT physicist and award-winning novelist Alan Lightman also leverages grand gestures. In his case, he retreats each summer to a “tiny island” in Maine to think deeply and recharge. At least as of 2000, when he described this gesture in an interview, the island not only lacked Internet, but didn’t even have phone service. As he then justified: “It’s really about two and a half months that I’ll feel like I can recover some silence in my life… which is so hard to find.”

麻省理工学院物理学家、备受赞誉的小说家艾伦·莱特曼（Alan Lightman）也用过大手笔的方法。他每年夏天都会隐居到缅因州的一座“小岛”上，做深度思考，补充能量。在 2000 年他接受采访介绍这种方法时，那座小岛不仅没有网络，而且也没有电话服务。后来他又解释说：“在那大约两个半月的时间里，我感觉自己似乎恢复了生命中一些沉静的东西……真的是很难得。”

Not everyone has the freedom to spend two months in Maine, but many writers, including Dan Pink and Michael Pollan, simulate the experience year-round by building—often at significant expense and effort—writing cabins on their properties. (Pollan, for his part, even wrote a book about his experience building his cabin in the woods behind his former Connecticut home.) These outbuildings aren’t strictly necessary for these writers, who need only a laptop and a flat surface to put it on to ply their trade. But it’s not the amenities of the cabins that generate their value; it’s instead the grand gesture represented in the design and building of the cabin for the sole purpose of enabling better writing.

虽然并非所有人都能自由地在缅因州过上两个月，但是包括丹·品克（Dan Pink）和迈克尔·波伦（Michael Pollan）在内的很多作家都会在自己的园子里建造——通常需要非常高的成本和精力投入——写作小屋，一年四季模仿这种经历。（波伦甚至写了一本书，讲述他在以前康涅狄格的家门后小树林里建造小屋的经历。）对于这些作家而言，建这些附属小屋并非必需，他们其实只需要一台笔记本电脑和一张桌子就能开工。但是体现这些小屋价值的并不是其舒适度，而是仅仅为了写出更好的东西而设计和建造小屋的大手笔。

Not every grand gesture need be so permanent. After the pathologically competitive Bell Labs physicist William Shockley was scooped in the invention of the transistor—as I detail in the next strategy, two members of his team made the breakthrough at a time when Shockley was away working on another project—he locked himself in a hotel room in Chicago, where he had traveled ostensibly to attend a conference. He didn’t emerge from the room until he had ironed out the details for a better design that had been rattling around in his mind. When he finally did leave the room, he airmailed his notes back to Murray Hill, New Jersey, so that a colleague could paste them into his lab notebook and sign them to timestamp the innovation. The junction form of the transistor that Shockley worked out in this burst of depth ended up earning him a share of the Nobel Prize subsequently awarded for the invention.

并非每一次大手笔都是这种永久性的。贝尔实验室物理学家威廉·肖克利（William Shockley）有近乎病态的好胜心，当了解到晶体管的发明被他人抢走的消息之后（我在介绍下一种策略时将详述，肖克利的团队中有两名成员在他离开研究其他项目的时候实现了这项突破），他将自己锁到芝加哥的一家旅馆房间里，他假借参加会议的名义旅行到这里。他一直待在房间里，直到最后将头脑中一直构思的想法夯实成一种更好的设计。他最终离开了那个房间，通过航空邮件将笔记寄回了位于新泽西茉莉山丘（Murray Hill）的实验室总部，请同事将笔记粘贴到实验室笔记本中并签注，由此确定发明时间。肖克利在这短暂的深度爆发之后发明的结式晶体管，帮他赢得了后来颁给此项发明的诺贝尔奖。

An even more extreme example of a onetime grand gesture yielding results is a story involving Peter Shankman, an entrepreneur and social media pioneer. As a popular speaker, Shankman spends much of his time flying. He eventually realized that thirty thousand feet was an ideal environment for him to focus. As he explained in a blog post, “Locked in a seat with nothing in front of me, nothing to distract me, nothing to set off my ‘Ooh! Shiny!’ DNA, I have nothing to do but be at one with my thoughts.” It was sometime after this realization that Shankman signed a book contract that gave him only two weeks to finish the entire manuscript. Meeting this deadline would require incredible concentration. To achieve this state, Shankman did something unconventional. He booked a round-trip business-class ticket to Tokyo. He wrote during the whole flight to Japan, drank an espresso in the business class lounge once he arrived in Japan, then turned around and flew back, once again writing the whole way—arriving back in the States only thirty hours after he first left with a completed manuscript now in hand. “The trip cost $4,000 and was worth every penny,” he explained.

另外还有一个关于彼得·尚克曼（Peter Shankman）的单次大手笔的例子更加极端，尚克曼是一名企业家和社交媒体的先驱。作为一位著名的演说家，尚克曼大部分时间都在四处飞。最终他意识到 3000 英尺的高空是帮助他保持专注的理想环境。他在一篇博客文章中解释说：“封闭在一个座位里，眼前没有任何东西，没有任何东西干扰我，没有任何东西激发我那‘哇！好晃眼！’的 DNA。”有了这种认识之后一段时间，尚克曼签了一本书的合同，要求仅用两周的时间完成全部手稿。要赶上截稿日期，要求他极度专注。为了达到这种状态，尚克曼做了一件非常规的事情。他预定了一张往返东京的商务舱机票，在飞往日本的航班上写了一路，抵达日本后在商务舱休息室里喝了一杯浓咖啡，然后登上返航的飞机，又写了一路。等他回到美国时，已经有了完成的手稿，这距他最初离开时仅仅 30 小时。“这趟旅行花了 4000 美元，但是完全物有所值。”他解释说。

In all of these examples, it’s not just the change of environment or seeking of quiet that enables more depth. The dominant force is the psychology of committing so seriously to the task at hand. To put yourself in an exotic location to focus on a writing project, or to take a week off from work just to think, or to lock yourself in a hotel room until you complete an important invention: These gestures push your deep goal to a level of mental priority that helps unlock the needed mental resources. Sometimes to go deep, you must first go big.

所有这些例子中的人物，并非仅仅是靠环境的改变才实现了更深度的工作。其中主导的力量是严肃认真致力于手头任务的心理。置身异域专注于写作项目，或是远离工作一周只做思考，又或是将自己锁到酒店房间里直到完成一项重要的发明：这些举动推动你的深度目标占据心理优先的地位，有助于你解锁必要的心理资源。有时想要做到深入，必须先要做大。

## Don’t Work Alone

The relationship between deep work and collaboration is tricky. It’s worth taking the time to untangle, however, because properly leveraging collaboration can increase the quality of deep work in your professional life.

深度工作与协作之间的关系非常微妙。然而，这种关系值得我们花时间去解开，因为恰当展开协作可以提升你在职业生活中深度工作的质量。

It’s helpful to start our discussion of this topic by taking a step back to consider what at first seems to be an unresolvable conflict. In Part 1 of this book I criticized Facebook for the design of its new headquarters. In particular, I noted that the company’s goal to create the world’s largest open office space—a giant room that will reportedly hold twenty-eight hundred workers—represents an absurd attack on concentration. Both intuition and a growing body of research underscore the reality that sharing a workspace with a large number of coworkers is incredibly distracting—creating an environment that thwarts attempts to think seriously. In a 2013 article summarizing recent research on this topic, *Bloomberg Businessweek* went so far as to call for an end to the “tyranny of the open-plan office.”

在开始探讨这个主题之前，有必要回头思考一下最初看似无法解决的一个矛盾。在本书的第一部分，我批评了脸谱网的新总部大楼设计。我特别指出这家公司打造全球最大开放办公空间的目标——一个巨大的房间，据称可以装下 2800 名员工——是对专注的可笑打击。本能和越来越多的研究都不看好这种大批同事共享工作空间的方式，认为这种方式极易扰乱心神——创造的环境使人难以做认真的思考。2013 年《彭博商业周刊》（Bloomberg Businessweek）有一篇文章总结了近年来在这个主题上的研究成果，并提出终结这种“开放式布局办公室的暴政”。

And yet, these open office designs are not embraced haphazardly. As Maria Konnikova reports in *The New Yorker*, when this concept first emerged, its goal was to “facilitate communication and idea flow.” This claim resonated with American businesses looking to embrace an aura of start-up unconventionality. Josh Tyrangiel, the editor of *Bloomberg Businessweek*, for example, explained the lack of offices in Bloomberg’s headquarters as follows: “Open plan is pretty spectacular; it ensures that everyone is attuned to the broad mission, and… it encourages curiosity between people who work in different disciplines.” Jack Dorsey justified the open layout of the Square headquarters by explaining: “We encourage people to stay out in the open because we believe in serendipity—and people walking by each other teaching new things.”

然而，这种开放式办公室的设计为世人所接受并非出于偶然。正如这种理念最初出现时，玛莉亚·柯妮可娃（Maria Konnikova）在《纽约客》上发表的文章所说的一样，这种设计的目的在于“助力交流和思想流动”。这种理念唤起了寻求打破传统的美国工商企业的共鸣。比如《彭博商业周刊》编辑乔希·塔伦杰尼（Josh Tyrangiel）如此解释彭博通讯社总部没有设立太多办公室的原因：“开放式设计非常惊人；这种设计能够确保所有人都与整体使命协调一致，而且……还能激发不同领域的人员互相产生兴趣。”杰克·多西解释时代广场总部的开放式布局时是这么说的：“我们鼓励员工到开阔区域工作，因为我们相信意外发现——员工互相协作会产生新想法。”

For the sake of discussion, let’s call this principle—that when you allow people to bump into each other smart collaborations and new ideas emerge—the *theory of serendipitous creativity*. When Mark Zuckerberg decided to build the world’s largest office, we can reasonably conjecture, this theory helped drive his decision, just as it has driven many of the moves toward open workspaces elsewhere in Silicon Valley and beyond. (Other less-exalted factors, like saving money and increasing supervision, also play a role, but they’re not as sexy and are therefore less emphasized.)

为了讨论方便，我们将这种原则称作偶然创造力理论，即当允许员工与其他聪明的协作者相遇，就会有新想法涌现出来。马克·扎克伯格决定建造全球最大的办公室时，我们有理由推测，这个理论促使他做出了这个决定，就好似它促使硅谷及以外的很多公司推行开放式办公场所一样。（节省成本、加强监督等其他一些重要性相对较低的因素也起到了作用，但是肯定不如上述理由炫酷，也因此不会得到更多强调。）

This decision between promoting concentration and promoting serendipity seems to indicate that deep work (an individual endeavor) is incompatible with generating creative insights (a collaborative endeavor). This conclusion, however, is flawed. It’s based, I argue, on an incomplete understanding of the theory of serendipitous creativity. To support this claim, let’s consider the origins of this particular understanding of what spurs breakthroughs.

要在提倡专注还是意外发现之间做出选择，暗示了深度工作（个体努力）无法与创造性洞见（协作努力）相容。然而这个结论是有缺陷的。我认为这个结论的基础是对偶然创造力理论的片面理解。为了证明这个论断，我们可以追根溯源，看看是什么造成了这种理解。

The theory in question has many sources, but I happen to have a personal connection to one of the more well-known. During my seven years at MIT, I worked on the site of the institute’s famed Building 20. This structure, located at the intersection of Main and Vassar Streets in East Cambridge, and eventually demolished in 1998, was thrown together as a temporary shelter during World War II, meant to house the overflow from the school’s bustling Radiation Laboratory. As noted by a 2012 *New Yorker* article, the building was initially seen as a failure: “Ventilation was poor and hallways were dim. The walls were thin, the roof leaked, and the building was broiling in the summer and freezing in the winter.”

When the war ended, however, the influx of scientists to Cambridge continued. MIT needed space, so instead of immediately demolishing Building 20 as they had promised local officials (in exchange for lax permitting), they continued using it as overflow space. The result was that a mismatch of different departments—from nuclear science to linguistics to electronics—shared the low-slung building alongside more esoteric tenants such as a machine shop and a piano repair facility. Because the building was cheaply constructed, these groups felt free to rearrange space as needed. Walls and floors could be shifted and equipment bolted to the beams. In recounting the story of Jerrold Zacharias’s work on the first atomic clock, the abovementioned *New Yorker* article points to the importance of his ability to remove two floors from his Building 20 lab so he could install the three-story cylinder needed for his experimental apparatus.

In MIT lore, it’s generally believed that this haphazard combination of different disciplines, thrown together in a large reconfigurable building, led to chance encounters and a spirit of inventiveness that generated breakthroughs at a fast pace, innovating topics as diverse as Chomsky grammars, Loran navigational radars, and video games, all within the same productive postwar decades. When the building was finally demolished to make way for the $300 million Frank Gehry–designed Stata Center (where I spent my time), its loss was mourned. In tribute to the “plywood palace” it replaced, the interior design of the Stata Center includes boards of unfinished plywood and exposed concrete with construction markings left intact.

Around the same time that Building 20 was hastily constructed, a more systematic pursuit of serendipitous creativity was under way two hundred miles to the southwest in Murray Hill, New Jersey. It was here that Bell Labs director Mervin Kelly guided the construction of a new home for the lab that would purposefully encourage interaction between its diverse mix of scientists and engineers. Kelly dismissed the standard university-style approach of housing different departments in different buildings, and instead connected the spaces into one contiguous structure joined by long hallways—some so long that when you stood at one end it would appear to converge to a vanishing point. As Bell Labs chronicler Jon Gertner notes about this design: “Traveling the hall’s length without encountering a number of acquaintances, problems, diversions and ideas was almost impossible. A physicist on his way to lunch in the cafeteria was like a magnet rolling past iron filings.”

This strategy, mixed with Kelly’s aggressive recruitment of some of the world’s best minds, yielded some of the most concentrated innovation in the history of modern civilization. In the decades following the Second World War, the lab produced, among other achievements: the first solar cell, laser, communication satellite, cellular communication system, and fiber optic networking. At the same time, their theorists formulated both information theory and coding theory, their astronomers won the Nobel Prize for empirically validating the Big Bang Theory, and perhaps most important of all, their physicists invented the transistor.

The theory of serendipitous creativity, in other words, seems well justified by the historical record. The transistor, we can argue with some confidence, probably required Bell Labs and its ability to put solid-state physicists, quantum theorists, and world-class experimentalists in one building where they could serendipitously encounter one another and learn from their varied expertise. This was an invention unlikely to come from a lone scientist thinking deeply in the academic equivalent of Carl Jung’s stone tower.

But it’s here that we must embrace more nuance in understanding what *really* generated innovation in sites such as Building 20 and Bell Labs. To do so, let’s return once again to my own experience at MIT. When I arrived as a new PhD student in the fall of 2004, I was a member of the first incoming class to be housed in the new Stata Center, which, as mentioned, replaced Building 20. Because the center was new, incoming students were given tours that touted its features. Frank Gehry, we learned, arranged the offices around common spaces and introduced open stairwells between adjacent floors, all in an effort to support the type of serendipitous encounters that had defined its predecessor. But what struck me at the time was a feature that hadn’t occurred to Gehry but had been recently added at the faculty’s insistence: special gaskets installed into the office doorjambs to improve soundproofing. The professors at MIT—some of the most innovative technologists in the world—wanted nothing to do with an open-office-style workspace. They instead demanded the ability to close themselves off.

This combination of soundproofed offices connected to large common areas yields a *hub-and-spoke* architecture of innovation in which both serendipitous encounter and isolated deep thinking are supported. It’s a setup that straddles a spectrum where on one extreme we find the solo thinker, isolated from inspiration but free from distraction, and on the other extreme, we find the fully collaborative thinker in an open office, flush with inspiration but struggling to support the deep thinking needed to build on it.[\*](footnotes.xhtml#fn0007fn)

If we turn our attention back to Building 20 and Bell Labs, we see that this is the architecture they deployed as well. Neither building offered anything resembling a modern open office plan. They were instead constructed using the standard layout of private offices connected to shared hallways. Their creative mojo had more to do with the fact that these offices shared a small number of long connecting spaces—forcing researchers to interact whenever they needed to travel from one location to another. These mega-hallways, in other words, provided highly effective hubs.

We can, therefore, still dismiss the depth-destroying open office concept without dismissing the innovation-producing theory of serendipitous creativity. The key is to maintain both in a hub-and-spoke-style arrangement: Expose yourself to ideas in hubs on a regular basis, but maintain a spoke in which to work deeply on what you encounter.

This division of efforts, however, is not the full story, as even when one returns to a spoke, solo work is still not necessarily the best strategy. Consider, for example, the previously mentioned invention of the (point-contact) transistor at Bell Labs. This breakthrough was supported by a large group of researchers, all with separate specialties, who came together to form the *solid-state physics research group*—a team dedicated to inventing a smaller and more reliable alternative to the vacuum tube. This group’s collaborative conversations were necessary preconditions to the transistor: a clear example of the usefulness of hub behavior.

Once the research group laid the intellectual groundwork for the component, the innovation process shifted to a spoke. What makes this particular innovation process an interesting case, however, is that even when it shifted to a spoke it remained collaborative. It was two researchers in particular—the experimentalist Walter Brattain and the quantum theorist John Bardeen—who over a period of one month in 1947 made the series of breakthroughs that led to the first working solid-state transistor.

Brattain and Bardeen worked together during this period in a small lab, often side by side, pushing each other toward better and more effective designs. These efforts consisted primarily of deep work—but a type of deep work we haven’t yet encountered. Brattain would concentrate intensely to engineer an experimental design that could exploit Bardeen’s latest theoretical insight; then Bardeen would concentrate intensely to make sense of what Brattain’s latest experiments revealed, trying to expand his theoretical framework to match the observations. This back-and-forth represents a collaborative form of deep work (common in academic circles) that leverages what I call *the whiteboard effect*. For some types of problems, working with someone else at the proverbial shared whiteboard can push you deeper than if you were working alone. The presence of the other party waiting for your next insight—be it someone physically in the same room or collaborating with you virtually—can short-circuit the natural instinct to avoid depth.

We can now step back and draw some practical conclusions about the role of collaboration in deep work. The success of Building 20 and Bell Labs indicates that isolation is not required for productive deep work. Indeed, their example indicates that for many types of work—especially when pursuing innovation—collaborative deep work can yield better results. This strategy, therefore, asks that you consider this option in contemplating how best to integrate depth into your professional life. In doing so, however, keep the following two guidelines in mind.

*First*, distraction remains a destroyer of depth. Therefore, the hub-and-spoke model provides a crucial template. Separate your pursuit of serendipitous encounters from your efforts to think deeply and build on these inspirations. You should try to optimize each effort separately, as opposed to mixing them together into a sludge that impedes both goals.

*Second*, even when you retreat to a spoke to think deeply, when it’s reasonable to leverage the whiteboard effect, do so. By working side by side with someone on a problem, you can push each other toward deeper levels of depth, and therefore toward the generation of more and more valuable output as compared to working alone.

When it comes to deep work, in other words, consider the use of collaboration when appropriate, as it can push your results to a new level. At the same time, don’t lionize this quest for interaction and positive randomness to the point where it crowds out the unbroken concentration ultimately required to wring something useful out of the swirl of ideas all around us.

## Execute Like a Business

The story has become lore in the world of business consulting. In the mid-1990s, Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen received a call from Andy Grove, the CEO and chairman of Intel. Grove had encountered Christensen’s research on disruptive innovation and asked him to fly out to California to discuss the theory’s implications for Intel. On arrival, Christensen walked through the basics of disruption: entrenched companies are often unexpectedly dethroned by start-ups that begin with cheap offerings at the low end of the market, but then, over time, improve their cheap products *just enough* to begin to steal high-end market share. Grove recognized that Intel faced this threat from low-end processors produced by upstart companies like AMD and Cyrix. Fueled by his newfound understanding of disruption, Grove devised the strategy that led to the Celeron family of processors—a lower-performance offering that helped Intel successfully fight off the challenges from below.

有一个故事在商业咨询界里已经成为传说。20 世纪 90 年代中期，哈佛商学院教授克莱顿·克里斯坦森（Clayton Christensen）接到英特尔公司首席执行官兼主席安迪·格鲁夫（Andy Grove）的电话。格鲁夫偶然读到克里斯坦森关于破坏性创新的研究文章，于是请他飞来加利福尼亚探讨这种理论在英特尔的应用。刚到英特尔，克里斯坦森就概要介绍了破坏性创新理论的一些基本点：根基稳固的公司经常会出其不意地被新兴公司赶下神坛，这些新兴公司以在低端市场兜售便宜产品起步，之后经过实践积累逐渐改进自己的廉价产品，直到刚好可以窃取高端市场份额。格鲁夫意识到英特尔面临着 AMD 和新瑞仕等新兴企业在低端处理器市场的威胁。格鲁夫吸收了新学到的破坏性创新理论，调整了公司战略，推出了赛扬系列处理器——一种低端产品，帮助英特尔成功击退了低端市场的挑战。

There is, however, a lesser-known piece to this story. As Christensen recalls, Grove asked him during a break in this meeting, “How do I do this?” Christensen responded with a discussion of business strategy, explaining how Grove could set up a new business unit and so on. Grove cut him off with a gruff reply: “You are such a naïve academic. I asked you *how* to do it, and you told me *what* I should do. *I know what I need to do. I just don’t know how to do it.*”

然而，这段历史故事中有一段插曲很少有人了解。据克里斯坦森回忆，格鲁夫在一次会间休息时问他：“我该如何去做这件事？”克里斯坦森就与他探讨了商业策略，向格鲁夫解释说他可以成立一个新的公司业务单元之类的。格鲁夫生硬地打断了他：“你真是个天真的学院派啊。我问你如何做，你却告诉我应该做什么。我知道自己该做什么。我只是不知道如何做而已。”

As Christensen later explained, this division between *what* and *how* is crucial but is overlooked in the professional world. It’s often straightforward to identify a strategy needed to achieve a goal, but what trips up companies is figuring out how to execute the strategy once identified. I came across this story in a foreword Christensen wrote for a book titled *The 4 Disciplines of Execution*, which built on extensive consulting case studies to describe four “disciplines” (abbreviated, 4DX) for helping companies successfully implement high-level strategies. What struck me as I read was that this gap between *what* and *how* was relevant to my personal quest to spend more time working deeply. Just as Andy Grove had identified the importance of competing in the low-end processor market, I had identified the importance of prioritizing depth. What I needed was help figuring out how to execute this strategy.

克里斯坦森后来解释说，这种什么与如何的区别非常重要，但在职业世界中往往容易被忽略。找出实现某个目标的战略往往很简单，但是真正引领公司上行的反而是确定了战略之后该如何实施战略。我在克里斯坦森为一本名为《高效能人士的执行 4 原则》（The 4 Disciplines of Execution）的书写的前言中读到了这个故事，这本书选取了大量咨询案例，用于描述 4 种“原则”（简称 4DX），帮助公司成功实施高水平的战略。阅读中吸引我的是这种什么与如何的区别，其与想将更多时间用于深度工作的诉求恰好相关。正如安迪·格鲁夫认识到了参与低端处理器市场竞争的重要性，我也认识到了深度优先的重要性。我接下来需要做的是理清如何实施这项策略。

Intrigued by these parallels, I set out to adapt the 4DX framework to my personal work habits and ended up surprised by how helpful they proved in driving me toward effective action on my goal of working deeply. These ideas may have been forged for the world of big business, but the underlying concepts seem to apply anywhere that something important needs to get done against the backdrop of many competing obligations and distractions. With this in mind, I’ve summarized in the following sections the four disciplines of the 4DX framework, and for each I describe how I adapted it to the specific concerns of developing a deep work habit.

受这种相似性的启发，我着手将 4DX 框架应用到个人工作习惯的培养上，结果很令人吃惊，这种方法极大地助力了我在实现深度工作目标方面的努力。这些观点或许最初是为大企业设计的，但是其基本理念似乎适用于所有既要完成某项重要的事情，同时又要面临很多与其相矛盾的责任和分心事的地方。出于这种想法，我总结出下面几个小节，介绍 4DX 框架下的 4 种原则，针对每一种原则我都会介绍自己是如何将其加以改进，以应对深度工作习惯培养中的特定问题。

### Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important

As the authors of *The 4 Disciplines of Execution* explain, “The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish.” They elaborate that execution should be aimed at a small number of “wildly important goals.” This simplicity will help focus an organization’s energy to a sufficient intensity to ignite real results.

正如《高效能人士的执行 4 原则》的作者所说的：“你想做的事情越多，完成的事情反而越少。”这句话阐述的意思是，执行需要专注于少量“极端重要的目标”。这样简化选择，有助于组织和集中足够的精力来达成实在的成果。

?> 这个想法比较接近Ni人的本能，比较违反Ne人的本能。

For an individual focused on deep work, the implication is that you should identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours. The general exhortation to “spend more time working deeply” doesn’t spark a lot of enthusiasm. To instead have a specific goal that would return tangible and substantial professional benefits will generate a steadier stream of enthusiasm. In a 2014 column titled “The Art of Focus,” David Brooks endorsed this approach of letting ambitious goals drive focused behavior, explaining: “If you want to win the war for attention, don’t try to say ‘no’ to the trivial distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say ‘yes’ to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else.”

对于专注于深度工作的个人而言，这就要求你在深度工作时间里追求少数几个雄心勃勃的成果。“花更多的时间用来深度工作”这种泛泛的指令并不能激起太多的热情。有一个明确的目标，能够带来实实在在的职业收益，也可以带来更稳定的热情。大卫·布鲁克斯在 2014 年的一篇专栏文章“专注的艺术”中对利用雄心勃勃的目标驱使专注行为的方法表示了认可，他解释道：“如果你想要赢得注意力的战争，不要对那些从信息大杂烩中找到的琐碎分心之事说‘不’；而是要对那些激发出你无尽渴望的事情说‘是’，让这些能激发无尽渴望的事情挤掉所有其他的事情。”

For example, when I first began experimenting with 4DX, I set the specific important goal of publishing five high-quality peer-reviewed papers in the upcoming academic year. This goal was ambitious, as it was more papers than I had been publishing, and there were tangible rewards attached to it (tenure review was looming). Combined, these two properties helped the goal stoke my motivation.

比如，当我最开始尝试 4DX 的时候，我设定的极度重要目标是在未来一个学年里发表 5 篇高质量的同行审评论文。这个目标雄心勃勃，因为发表这个数量的论文是我以前从未做到过的，而且这个目标有着切实的回报（教职评估马上就要开始）。这两种原因结合起来，使这个目标燃起了我的动力。

### Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures

Once you’ve identified a wildly important goal, you need to measure your success. In 4DX, there are two types of metrics for this purpose: *lag* measures and *lead* measures. Lag measures describe the thing you’re ultimately trying to improve. For example, if your goal is to increase customer satisfaction in your bakery, then the relevant lag measure is your customer satisfaction scores. As the 4DX authors explain, the problem with lag measures is that they come too late to change your behavior: “When you receive them, the performance that drove them is already in the past.”

确定了极端重要的目标之后，你需要衡量自己的成功程度。在 4DX 框架下，有两种衡量指标：滞后性指标和引领性指标。滞后性指标用于描述你最终尝试改善的方面。比如，如果你的目标是提升面包房的客户满意度，那么相应的滞后性指标就是客户的满意度分数。而正如 4DX 的作者解释的，滞后性指标的问题在于它们出现得太晚，来不及改变你的行为：“当你拿到滞后性指标的时候，致力于实现这些指标的表现都已经成为过去。”

Lead measures, on the other hand, “measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.” In the bakery example, a good lead measure might be the number of customers who receive free samples. This is a number you can directly increase by giving out more samples. As you increase this number, your lag measures will likely eventually improve as well. In other words, lead measures turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control in the near future that will then have a positive impact on your long-term goals.

引领性指标则“衡量了实现滞后性指标的新行为”。在面包房的例子里，接受免费试吃样品的客户数量就是一个不错的引领性指标。这个数字可以通过分发更多的免费试吃样品而直接增加。随着这个数字的增加，你的滞后性指标最终也很可能得到提升。换言之，引领性指标引导你将注意力转移到提升你在短期内可以直接控制的行为上，并会对你的长期目标带来积极的影响。

For an individual focused on deep work, it’s easy to identify the relevant lead measure: *time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal.* Returning to my example, this insight had an important impact on how I directed my academic research. I used to focus on lag measures, such as papers published per year. These measures, however, lacked influence on my day-to-day behavior because there was nothing I could do in the short term that could immediately generate a noticeable change to this long-term metric. When I shifted to tracking deep work hours, suddenly these measures became relevant to my day-to-day: Every hour extra of deep work was immediately reflected in my tally.

对于专注于深度工作的个人而言，确定相应的引领性指标非常容易：专注于极度重要目标上的深度工作状态时间。回到我个人的例子上，这种认识对于如何安排我的学术研究产生了非常重要的影响。我以前经常关注于滞后性指标，比如每年发表的论文数。然而，这些目标对我的日常行为缺乏影响，因为我不知道短期内做什么可以立刻对长期的指标产生即时的可观改变。当我转而关注深度工作时间之后，突然间这些指标都与我的日常有了关联。多一个小时的深度工作时间立刻就能显示在我的计分板上。

### Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard

“People play differently when they’re keeping score,” the 4DX authors explain. They then elaborate that when attempting to drive your team’s engagement toward your organization’s wildly important goal, it’s important that they have a public place to record and track their lead measures. This scoreboard creates a sense of competition that drives them to focus on these measures, even when other demands vie for their attention. It also provides a reinforcing source of motivation. Once the team notices their success with a lead measure, they become invested in perpetuating this performance.

“计分的时候，人们的表现很不同。”4DX 的作者解释道。当驱使你的团队专注于所在组织的极度重要目标时，在一个公开的地方记录、跟踪他们的引领性指标非常重要。这个计分板可以制造一种竞争氛围，驱使他们专注于这些指标，即使其他诉求吸引他们注意力的时候也不例外。此外计分板还可以强化动机。一旦团队注意到他们在引领性指标上的成功，他们就会很投入地保持这种状态。

In the preceding discipline, I argued that for an individual focused on deep work, hours spent working deeply should be the lead measure. It follows, therefore, that the individual’s scoreboard should be a physical artifact in the workspace that displays the individual’s current deep work hour count.

在前述的一项原则中，我提出要想一个个体专注于深度工作，用于深度工作的时间应该作为引领性指标。因此这个人的计分板应该是工作场所的人工制品，显示这个人当前的深度工作时间。

In my early experiments with 4DX, I settled on a simple but effective solution for implementing this scoreboard. I took a piece of card stock and divided it into rows, one for each week of the current semester. I then labeled each row with the dates of the week and taped it to the wall next to my computer monitor (where it couldn’t be ignored). As each week progressed, I kept track of the hours spent in deep work that week with a simple tally of tick marks in that week’s row. To maximize the motivation generated by this scoreboard, whenever I reached an important milestone in an academic paper (e.g., solving a key proof), I would circle the tally mark corresponding to the hour where I finished the result.[\*](footnotes.xhtml#fn0008fn) This served two purposes. First, it allowed me to connect, at a visceral level, accumulated deep work hours and tangible results. Second, it helped calibrate my expectations for how many hours of deep work were needed per result. This reality (which was larger than I first assumed) helped spur me to squeeze more such hours into each week.

在我早期的 4DX 实验中，我设定了一种简单但有效的计分方式。我拿出一张卡片纸，将其剪成条，每一条记录当前学期的一个周。而后我在每一条卡片上记下了每周的日期，将其贴在电脑显示器旁边的墙上（在这里我无法忽略它的存在）。每一周我都在当周的卡片上简单地做个标记，记录当周的深度工作时间。为了使这个计分板带来的动力最大化，每当我的学术论文取得重要进展时（比如解决了一项关键论证），我就会在实现这个成果的那个小时标记上画一个圈。这么做有两个目的。首先，这样可以使我从本能层面将累积的深度工作时长与实在的结果相联系。第二，这样有助于我校准个人对于完成每项成果所需深度工作时间的期望。这种做法（比我最初想象的要更有效）激励我每周都挤出更多的深度工作时间。

### Discipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability

The 4DX authors elaborate that the final step to help maintain a focus on lead measures is to put in place “a rhythm of regular and frequent meetings of any team that owns a wildly important goal.” During these meetings, the team members must confront their scoreboard, commit to specific actions to help improve the score before the next meeting, and describe what happened with the commitments they made at the last meeting. They note that this review can be condensed to only a few minutes, but it must be regular for its effect to be felt. The authors argue that it’s this discipline where “execution really happens.”

4DX 的作者详细阐释了保持专注于引领性指标的最后一步是要“保持节律性地与同享极度重要目标的团队会面”。在这些会议中，团队成员必须直面计分板，投入到特定的行为以保证下次会议之前提升分数，同时要讲述上次会议中做的承诺结果如何。他们指出此类回顾的会议可以压缩到几分钟的时间内，但是必须经常举行，以确保其效果能被人感受到。作者称这才是“执行的真正实现”。

For an individual focused on his or her own deep work habit, there’s likely no team to meet with, but this doesn’t exempt you from the need for regular accountability. In multiple places throughout this book I discuss and recommend the habit of a weekly review in which you make a plan for the workweek ahead (see Rule #4). During my experiments with 4DX, I used a weekly review to look over my scoreboard to celebrate good weeks, help understand what led to bad weeks, and most important, figure out how to ensure a good score for the days ahead. This led me to adjust my schedule to meet the needs of my lead measure—enabling significantly more deep work than if I had avoided such reviews altogether.

对于专注于深度工作的个人而言，很可能没有任何团队去会面，但是这并不意味着你就可以免去定期问责的过程。贯穿本书，我都在探讨、推荐每周回顾的习惯，在每周回顾的过程中你可以指定下一周的工作计划（参见准则 4）。在实验 4DX 的过程中，我每周回顾自己的计分板，庆贺表现好的一周，理清是什么导致了表现糟糕的一周，而且最重要的是找出能够确保未来几天得到好分数的方法。此举使我不断调整日程计划，以满足引领性指标的要求，大幅增加深度工作时间。


The 4DX framework is based on the fundamental premise that execution is more difficult than strategizing. After hundreds and hundreds of case studies, its inventors managed to isolate a few basic disciplines that seem to work particularly well in conquering this difficulty. It’s no surprise, therefore, that these same disciplines can have a similar effect on your personal goal of cultivating a deep work habit.

To conclude, let’s return one last time to my own example. As I noted earlier, when I first embraced 4DX I adopted the goal of publishing five peer-reviewed papers in the 2013–2014 academic year. This was an ambitious goal given that I had published only four papers the previous year (a feat I was proud of). Throughout this 4DX experiment, the clarity of this goal, coupled with the simple but unavoidable feedback of my lead measure scoreboard, pushed me to a level of depth I hadn’t before achieved. In retrospect, it was not so much the intensity of my deep work periods that increased, but instead their regularity. Whereas I used to cluster my deep thinking near paper submission deadlines, the 4DX habit kept my mind concentrated throughout the full year. It ended up, I must admit, an exhausting year (especially given that I was writing this book at the same time). But it also turned out to produce a convincing endorsement for the 4DX framework: By the summer of 2014, I had *nine* full papers accepted for publication, more than doubling what I had managed to accomplish in any preceding year.

## Be Lazy

In a 2012 article written for a *New York Times* blog, the essayist and cartoonist Tim Kreider provided a memorable self-description: “I am not busy. I am the laziest ambitious person I know.” Kreider’s distaste for frenetic work, however, was put to the test in the months leading up to the writing of his post. Here’s his description of the period: “I’ve insidiously started, because of professional obligations, to become busy… every morning my in-box was full of e-mails asking me to do things I did not want to do or presenting me with problems that I now had to solve.”

His solution? He fled to what he calls an “undisclosed location”: a place with no TV and no Internet (going online requires a bike ride to the local library), and where he could remain nonresponsive to the pinprick onslaught of small obligations that seem harmless in isolation but aggregate to serious injury to his deep work habit. “I’ve remembered about buttercups, stink bugs and the stars,” Kreider says about his retreat from activity. “I read. And I’m finally getting some real writing done for the first time in months.”

It’s important for our purposes to recognize that Kreider is no Thoreau. He didn’t retreat from the world of busyness to underscore a complicated social critique. His move to an undisclosed location was instead motivated by a surprising but practical insight: *It made him better at his job.* Here’s Kreider’s explanation:

*Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets… it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done.*

When Kreider talks of getting work done, of course, he’s not referencing shallow tasks. For the most part, the more time you can spend immersed in shallow work the more of it that gets accomplished. As a writer and artist, however, Kreider is instead concerned with deep work—the serious efforts that produce things the world values. These efforts, he’s convinced, need the support of a mind regularly released to leisure.

This strategy argues that you should follow Kreider’s lead by injecting regular and substantial freedom from professional concerns into your day, providing you with the idleness paradoxically required to get (deep) work done. There are many ways to accomplish this goal. You could, for example, use Kreider’s approach of retreating from the world of shallow tasks altogether by hiding out in an “undisclosed location,” but this isn’t practical for most people. Instead, I want to suggest a more applicable but still quite powerful heuristic: At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues until the next morning—no after-dinner e-mail check, no mental replays of conversations, and no scheming about how you’ll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely. If you need more time, then extend your workday, but once you shut down, your mind must be left free to encounter Kreider’s buttercups, stink bugs, and stars.

Before describing some tactics that support this strategy, I want to first explore *why* a shutdown will be profitable to your ability to produce valuable output. We have, of course, Tim Kreider’s personal endorsement, but it’s worth taking the time to also understand the science behind the value of downtime. A closer examination of this literature reveals the following three possible explanations for this value.

### Reason #1: Downtime Aids Insights

Consider the following excerpt from a 2006 paper that appeared in the journal *Science*:

*The scientific literature has emphasized the benefits of conscious deliberation in decision making for hundreds of years… The question addressed here is whether this view is justified. We hypothesize that it is not.*

Lurking in this bland statement is a bold claim. The authors of this study, led by the Dutch psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis, set out to prove that some decisions are better left to your unconscious mind to untangle. In other words, to actively try to work through these decisions will lead to a *worse* outcome than loading up the relevant information and then moving on to something else while letting the subconscious layers of your mind mull things over.

Dijksterhuis’s team isolated this effect by giving subjects the information needed for a complex decision regarding a car purchase. Half the subjects were told to think through the information and then make the best decision. The other half were distracted by easy puzzles after they read the information, and were then put on the spot to make a decision without having had time to consciously deliberate. The distracted group ended up performing better.

Observations from experiments such as this one led Dijksterhuis and his collaborators to introduce unconscious thought theory (UTT)—an attempt to understand the different roles conscious and unconscious deliberation play in decision making. At a high level, this theory proposes that for decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind must be involved. For example, if you need to do a math calculation, only your conscious mind is able to follow the precise arithmetic rules needed for correctness. On the other hand, for decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue. UTT hypothesizes that this is due to the fact that these regions of your brain have more neuronal bandwidth available, allowing them to move around more information and sift through more potential solutions than your conscious centers of thinking. Your conscious mind, according to this theory, is like a home computer on which you can run carefully written programs that return correct answers to limited problems, whereas your unconscious mind is like Google’s vast data centers, in which statistical algorithms sift through terabytes of unstructured information, teasing out surprising useful solutions to difficult questions.

The implication of this line of research is that providing your conscious brain time to rest enables your unconscious mind to take a shift sorting through your most complex professional challenges. A shutdown habit, therefore, is not necessarily reducing the amount of time you’re engaged in productive work, but is instead diversifying the type of work you deploy.

### Reason #2: Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply

A frequently cited 2008 paper appearing in the journal *Psychological Science* describes a simple experiment. Subjects were split into two groups. One group was asked to take a walk on a wooded path in an arboretum near the Ann Arbor, Michigan, campus where the study was conducted. The other group was sent on a walk through the bustling center of the city. Both groups were then given a concentration-sapping task called backward digit-span. The core finding of the study is that the nature group performed up to 20 percent better on the task. The nature advantage still held the next week when the researchers brought back the same subjects and switched the locations: It wasn’t the people who determined performance, but whether or not they got a chance to prepare by walking through the woods.

This study, it turns out, is one of many that validate attention restoration theory (ART), which claims that spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate. This theory, which was first proposed in the 1980s by the University of Michigan psychologists Rachel Kaplan and Stephen Kaplan (the latter of which co-authored the 2008 study discussed here, along with Marc Berman and John Jonides), is based on the concept of attention fatigue. To concentrate requires what ART calls *directed attention*. This resource is finite: If you exhaust it, you’ll struggle to concentrate. (For our purposes, we can think of this resource as the same thing as Baumeister’s limited willpower reserves we discussed in the introduction to this rule.[\*](footnotes.xhtml#fn0009fn)) The 2008 study argues that walking on busy city streets requires you to use directed attention, as you must navigate complicated tasks like figuring out when to cross a street to not get run over, or when to maneuver around the slow group of tourists blocking the sidewalk. After just fifty minutes of this focused navigation, the subject’s store of directed attention was low.

Walking through nature, by contrast, exposes you to what lead author Marc Berman calls “inherently fascinating stimuli,” using sunsets as an example. These stimuli “invoke attention modestly, allowing focused-attention mechanisms a chance to replenish.” Put another way, when walking through nature, you’re freed from having to direct your attention, as there are few challenges to navigate (like crowded street crossings), and experience enough interesting stimuli to keep your mind sufficiently occupied to avoid the need to actively aim your attention. This state allows your directed attention resources time to replenish. After fifty minutes of such replenishment, the subjects enjoyed a boost in their concentration.

(You might, of course, argue that perhaps being outside watching a sunset puts people in a good mood, and being in a good mood is what really helps performance on these tasks. But in a sadistic twist, the researchers debunked that hypothesis by repeating the experiment in the harsh Ann Arbor winter. Walking outside in brutal cold conditions didn’t put the subjects in a good mood, but they still ended up doing better on concentration tasks.)

What’s important to our purpose is observing that the implications of ART expand beyond the benefits of nature. The core mechanism of this theory is the idea that you can restore your ability to direct your attention if you give this activity a rest. Walking in nature provides such a mental respite, but so, too, can any number of relaxing activities so long as they provide similar “inherently fascinating stimuli” and freedom from directed concentration. Having a casual conversation with a friend, listening to music while making dinner, playing a game with your kids, going for a run—the types of activities that will fill your time in the evening if you enforce a work shutdown—play the same attention-restoring role as walking in nature.

On the other hand, if you keep interrupting your evening to check and respond to e-mail, or put aside a few hours after dinner to catch up on an approaching deadline, you’re robbing your directed attention centers of the uninterrupted rest they need for restoration. Even if these work dashes consume only a small amount of time, they prevent you from reaching the levels of deeper relaxation in which attention restoration can occur. Only the confidence that you’re done with work until the next day can convince your brain to downshift to the level where it can begin to recharge for the next day to follow. Put another way, trying to squeeze a little more work out of your evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that you end up getting *less* done than if you had instead respected a shutdown.

### Reason #3: The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That Important

The final argument for maintaining a clear endpoint to your workday requires us to return briefly to Anders Ericsson, the inventor of deliberate practice theory. As you might recall from Part 1, deliberate practice is the systematic stretching of your ability for a given skill. It is the activity required to get better at something. Deep work and deliberate practice, as I’ve argued, overlap substantially. For our purposes here we can use deliberate practice as a general-purpose stand-in for cognitively demanding efforts.

In Ericsson’s seminal 1993 paper on the topic, titled “The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance,” he dedicates a section to reviewing what the research literature reveals about an individual’s capacity for cognitively demanding work. Ericsson notes that for a novice, somewhere around an hour a day of intense concentration seems to be a limit, while for experts this number can expand to as many as four hours—but rarely more.

One of the studies cited, for example, catalogs the practice habits of a group of elite violin players training at Berlin’s Universität der Künste. This study found the elite players average around three and a half hours per day in a state of deliberate practice, usually separated into two distinct periods. The less accomplished players spent less time in a state of depth.

The implication of these results is that your capacity for deep work in a given day is limited. If you’re careful about your schedule (using, for example, the type of productivity strategies described in Rule #4), you should hit your daily deep work capacity during your workday. It follows, therefore, that by evening, you’re beyond the point where you can continue to effectively work deeply. Any work you do fit into the night, therefore, won’t be the type of high-value activities that really advance your career; your efforts will instead likely be confined to low-value shallow tasks (executed at a slow, low-energy pace). By deferring evening work, in other words, you’re not missing out on much of importance.



The three reasons just described support the general strategy of maintaining a strict endpoint to your workday. Let’s conclude by filling in some details concerning implementation.

To succeed with this strategy, you must first accept the commitment that once your workday shuts down, you cannot allow even the smallest incursion of professional concerns into your field of attention. This includes, crucially, checking e-mail, as well as browsing work-related websites. In both cases, even a brief intrusion of work can generate a self-reinforcing stream of distraction that impedes the shutdown advantages described earlier for a long time to follow (most people are familiar, for example, with the experience of glancing at an alarming e-mail on a Saturday morning and then having its implications haunt your thoughts for the rest of the weekend).

Another key commitment for succeeding with this strategy is to support your commitment to shutting down with a strict *shutdown ritual* that you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed. In more detail, this ritual should ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed that either (1) you have a plan you trust for its completion, or (2) it’s captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right. The process should be an algorithm: a series of steps you always conduct, one after another. When you’re done, have a set phrase you say that indicates completion (to end my own ritual, I say, “Shutdown complete”). This final step sounds cheesy, but it provides a simple cue to your mind that it’s safe to release work-related thoughts for the rest of the day.

To make this suggestion more concrete, let me walk through the steps of my own shutdown ritual (which I first developed around the time I was writing my doctoral dissertation, and have deployed, in one form or another, ever since). The first thing I do is take a final look at my e-mail inbox to ensure that there’s nothing requiring an urgent response before the day ends. The next thing I do is transfer any new tasks that are on my mind or were scribbled down earlier in the day into my official task lists. (I use Google Docs for storing my task lists, as I like the ability to access them from any computer—but the technology here isn’t really relevant.) Once I have these task lists open, I quickly skim *every* task in every list, and then look at the next few days on my calendar. These two actions ensure that there’s nothing urgent I’m forgetting or any important deadlines or appointments sneaking up on me. I have, at this point, reviewed everything that’s on my professional plate. To end the ritual, I use this information to make a rough plan for the next day. Once the plan is created, I say, “Shutdown complete,” and my work thoughts are done for the day.

The concept of a shutdown ritual might at first seem extreme, but there’s a good reason for it: the Zeigarnik effect. This effect, which is named for the experimental work of the early-twentieth-century psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, describes the ability of incomplete tasks to dominate our attention. It tells us that if you simply stop whatever you are doing at five p.m. and declare, “I’m done with work until tomorrow,” you’ll likely struggle to keep your mind clear of professional issues, as the many obligations left unresolved in your mind will, as in Bluma Zeigarnik’s experiments, keep battling for your attention throughout the evening (a battle that they’ll often win).

At first, this challenge might seem unresolvable. As any busy knowledge worker can attest, there are *always* tasks left incomplete. The idea that you can ever reach a point where all your obligations are handled is a fantasy. Fortunately, we don’t need to *complete* a task to get it off our minds. Riding to our rescue in this matter is our friend from earlier in the rule, the psychologist Roy Baumeister, who wrote a paper with E.J. Masicampo playfully titled “Consider It Done!” In this study, the two researchers began by replicating the Zeigarnik effect in their subjects (in this case, the researchers assigned a task and then cruelly engineered interruptions), but then found that they could significantly reduce the effect’s impact by asking the subjects, soon after the interruption, to make a plan for how they would *later* complete the incomplete task. To quote the paper: “Committing to a specific plan for a goal may therefore not only facilitate attainment of the goal but may also free cognitive resources for other pursuits.”

The shutdown ritual described earlier leverages this tactic to battle the Zeigarnik effect. While it doesn’t force you to explicitly identify a plan for every single task in your task list (a burdensome requirement), it does force you to capture every task in a common list, and then review these tasks before making a plan for the next day. This ritual ensures that no task will be forgotten: Each will be reviewed daily and tackled when the time is appropriate. Your mind, in other words, is released from its duty to keep track of these obligations at every moment—your shutdown ritual has taken over that responsibility.

Shutdown rituals can become annoying, as they add an extra ten to fifteen minutes to the end of your workday (and sometimes even more), but they’re necessary for reaping the rewards of systematic idleness summarized previously. From my experience, it should take a week or two before the shutdown habit sticks—that is, until your mind trusts your ritual enough to actually begin to release work-related thoughts in the evening. But once it does stick, the ritual will become a permanent fixture in your life—to the point that skipping the routine will fill you with a sense of unease.

Decades of work from multiple different subfields within psychology all point toward the conclusion that regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work. When you work, work hard. When you’re done, be done. Your average e-mail response time might suffer some, but you’ll more than make up for this with the sheer volume of truly important work produced during the day by your refreshed ability to dive deeper than your exhausted peers.
