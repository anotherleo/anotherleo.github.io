# Chapter One: Deep Work Is Valuable

As Election Day loomed in 2012, traffic at the *New York Times* website spiked[^1], as is normal during moments of national importance. But this time, something was different. A wildly disproportionate fraction of this traffic—more than 70 percent by some reports—was visiting a single location in the sprawling[^2] domain. It wasn’t a front-page breaking news story, and it wasn’t commentary[^3] from one of the paper’s Pulitzer Prize–winning columnists; it was instead a blog run by a baseball stats[^4] geek turned election forecaster named Nate Silver. Less than a year later, ESPN and ABC News lured Silver away from the *Times* (which tried to retain him by promising a staff of up to a dozen writers) in a major deal that would give Silver’s operation a role in everything from sports to weather to network news segments to, improbably[^5] enough, Academy Awards telecasts[^6]. Though there’s debate about the methodological rigor[^7] of Silver’s hand-tuned models, there are few who deny that in 2012 this thirty-five-year-old data whiz[^8] was a winner in our economy.

随着 2012 年总统选举日的临近，《纽约时报》网站流量达到了高峰。出现流量高峰在全美国关注的重要时刻是很常见的，但是这一次情况有些不同。这些流量中有极大部分（有些记者称超过 70%）流向诸多板块中的一个点。不是头版突发新闻故事，也不是报社普利策奖获得者的评论专栏，而是一个从棒球数据极客转行的竞选预测员的博客，这个人名叫内特·西尔弗（Nate Silver）。不到一年之后，娱乐与体育节目电视网（ESPN）和美国广播公司新闻网（ABC News）将西尔弗从《纽约时报》挖走（《纽约时报》也尝试挽留他，承诺为他安排 12 名作家当助理），从而完成了一项重大交易。他们许可西尔弗做任何报道，从体育、天气预报到网络新闻领域，甚至令人难以置信地，还有奥斯卡颁奖典礼电视直播。尽管舆论对于西尔弗一手打造的模型方法论之严谨性仍有争议，但是极少有人否认，2012 年这位 35 岁的数据奇才是我们经济中的赢家。

Another winner is David Heinemeier Hansson, a computer programming star who created the Ruby on Rails website development framework, which currently provides the foundation for some of the Web’s most popular destinations, including Twitter and Hulu. Hansson is a partner in the influential development firm Basecamp (called 37signals until 2014). Hansson doesn’t talk publicly about the magnitude of his profit share from Basecamp or his other revenue sources, but we can assume they’re lucrative given that Hansson splits his time between Chicago, Malibu, and Marbella, Spain, where he dabbles[^9] in high-performance race-car driving.

另外一位赢家是大卫·海涅迈尔·汉森（David Heinemeier Hansson），他是一名电脑程序明星，创造了 ruby on rails[^10]网站开发框架，为当前网络上最流行的网站提供了基础，其中包括推特和Hulu[^11]等。汉森是颇有影响力的开发公司 Basecamp（2014 年之前名为 37signals）的合伙人。汉森没有在公开场合谈及自己在 Basecamp 的利润分成等级，也未曾提及自己的其他收入来源，但是我们可以认定其收入很丰厚，足够他在芝加哥、马里布（Malibu）和西班牙马贝拉（Marbella）之间穿梭，同时在赛车比赛中有不俗表现。

Our third and final example of a clear winner in our economy is John Doerr, a general partner in the famed Silicon Valley venture capital fund Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Doerr helped fund many of the key companies fueling the current technological revolution, including Twitter, Google, Amazon, Netscape, and Sun Microsystems. The return on these investments has been astronomical[^12]: Doerr’s net worth, as of this writing, is more than $3 billion.

我们的第三位也是最后一位经济生活赢家是约翰·杜尔（John Doerr），他是闻名于世的硅谷风投公司凯鹏华盈（Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers）的普通合伙人。杜尔协助融资了多家引领科技变革的核心企业，包括推特、谷歌、亚马逊、网景公司和太阳微系统公司（Sun Microsystems）等。这些投资的回报都是天文数字，在我写作本书时，杜尔的个人净资产超过 30 亿美元。

Why have Silver, Hansson, and Doerr done so well? There are two types of answers to this question. The first are *micro* in scope and focus on the personality traits and tactics that helped drive this trio’s[^13] rise. The second type of answers are more *macro* in that they focus less on the individuals and more on the type of work they represent. Though both approaches to this core question are important, the macro answers will prove most relevant to our discussion, as they better illuminate what our current economy rewards.

为什么西尔弗、汉森和杜尔能取得这样的成就？这个问题有两种答案。第一种是微观层面，关注个人性格和策略对此三人成功的帮助。第二种答案是宏观的，关注点较少落在个人身上，而更多在于他们所代表的工作类型。尽管对这个核心问题的两种阐释都很重要，但是宏观的回答与本书探讨的内容关系更密切，因为它们能够更好地反映出当前经济回报最高的是哪些领域。

To explore this macro perspective we turn to a pair of MIT economists, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, who in their influential 2011 book, *Race Against the Machine,* provide a compelling case that among various forces at play, it’s the rise of digital technology in particular that’s transforming our labor markets in unexpected ways. “We are in the early throes[^14] of a Great Restructuring,” Brynjolfsson and McAfee explain early in their book. “Our technologies are racing ahead but many of our skills and organizations are lagging behind.” For many workers, this lag predicts bad news. As intelligent machines improve, and the gap between machine and human abilities shrinks, employers are becoming increasingly likely to hire “new machines” instead of “new people.” And when only a human will do, improvements in communications and collaboration technology are making remote work easier than ever before, motivating companies to outsource key roles to stars—leaving the local talent pool underemployed.

要从宏观角度探究个中原因，我们首先要谈及两个麻省理工的经济学家，埃里克·布林约尔松（Erik Brynjolfsson）和安德鲁·麦卡菲（Andrew McAfee）。二者在 2011 年出版的重要著作《与机器赛跑》（Race Against the Machine）中讲述了一个令人叹服的案例：在当今时代涌现出的各种力量中，恰是数字科技的崛起使我们的劳动力市场以一种未曾预想的方式发生改变。“我们正处于大重组最初的阵痛期。”布林约尔松和麦卡菲在他们的著作开端如此解释，“我们的科技日新月异，但是我们的很多技能和组织却严重落后。”对于很多工人而言，这种落后是坏消息。随着智能机器的不断改进，机器与人之间能力的差异逐渐缩小，雇主越来越多地选择聘用“新机器”而不是“新人类”。而只有人类可以做的工作也遭遇了问题，通讯和写作工具的发展使远程工作史无前例地方便，促使公司将关键岗位外包给行业中的翘楚，本地人才的失业率便会极高。

This reality is not, however, universally grim[^15]. As Brynjolfsson and McAfee emphasize, this Great Restructuring is not *driving down* all jobs but is instead *dividing* them. Though an increasing number of people will lose in this new economy as their skill becomes automatable or easily outsourced[^16], there are others who will not only survive, but thrive—becoming more valued (and therefore more rewarded) than before. Brynjolfsson and McAfee aren’t alone in proposing this bimodal trajectory[^17] for the economy. In 2013, for example, the George Mason economist Tyler Cowen published *Average Is Over*, a book that echoes this thesis of a digital division. But what makes Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s analysis particularly useful is that they proceed to identify three specific groups that will fall on the lucrative[^18] side of this divide and reap[^19] a disproportionate amount of the benefits of the Intelligent Machine Age. Not surprisingly, it’s to these three groups that Silver, Hansson, and Doerr happen to belong. Let’s touch on each of these groups in turn to better understand why they’re suddenly so valuable.

然而，这个冷酷的现实并没有渗透所有角落。布林约尔松和麦卡菲强调，这次大重组并没有碾压所有工作，而是将其分化。尽管在新经济形势下，越来越多的人因为技能可通过机械自动化实现或易于外包而遭遇挫败，但是还有一些人不仅能够存活，还变得比以往更有价值（也因此得到更多的回报）。提出这种经济双峰轨迹理念的并非只有布林约尔松和麦卡菲。比如，2013 年乔治梅森大学经济学家泰勒·考恩（Tyler Cowen）出版了《平均时代的终结》（Average Is Over）一书，反映了数字分化这一主题。但是布林约尔松和麦卡菲的分析之所以特别有用，是因为他们更进一步，识别出了拥有三种特点的人群，这三类人在智能机器时代处于获利的一方，收获极大的利益。毫无疑问，西尔弗、汉森和杜尔恰恰属于这三类人。我们来逐一分析每一类型的人，从而更好地理解他们为什么突然变得如此有价值。


## The High-Skilled Workers

Brynjolfsson and McAfee call the group personified by Nate Silver the “high-skilled” workers. Advances such as robotics and voice recognition are automating many low-skilled positions, but as these economists emphasize, “other technologies like data visualization, analytics, high speed communications, and rapid prototyping have augmented the contributions of more abstract and data-driven reasoning, increasing the values of these jobs.” In other words, those with the oracular[^20] ability to work with and tease valuable results out of increasingly complex machines will thrive. Tyler Cowen summarizes this reality more bluntly: “The key question will be: are you good at working with intelligent machines or not?”

布林约尔松和麦卡菲将以内特·西尔弗为代表的一类人称作“高级技术”工人。机器人和声控技术的发展使很多低技术要求的岗位实现了自动化，但是这两位经济学家强调：“诸如数据可视化、分析、高速通讯和快速原型设计等技术对抽象和数据导向型推理有了更高的要求，因此也提升了这些工作的价值。”换言之，那些有神奇工作能力，能够使用愈发复杂的机器创造出有价值成果的人将会成功。泰勒·考恩用更加坦率的方式总结了这种现实：“关键问题在于，你是否擅长使用智能机器？”

Nate Silver, of course, with his comfort in feeding data into large databases, then siphoning[^21] it out into his mysterious Monte Carlo simulations, is the epitome[^22] of the high-skilled worker. Intelligent machines are not an obstacle to Silver’s success, but instead provide its precondition.

当然，内特·西尔弗擅长将数据嵌入到更大的数据库中，然后抽取数据存入他那神秘的蒙特卡洛模拟（Monte Carlo simulations）中，这恰恰是高级技术工人的一个缩影。智能机器并非西尔弗成功的障碍，而是他成功的前提。


## The Superstars

The ace[^23] programmer David Heinemeier Hansson provides an example of the second group that Brynjolfsson and McAfee predict will thrive in our new economy: “superstars.” High-speed data networks and collaboration tools like e-mail and virtual meeting software have destroyed regionalism in many sectors of knowledge work. It no longer makes sense, for example, to hire a full-time programmer, put aside office space, and pay benefits, when you can instead pay one of the world’s best programmers, like Hansson, for just enough time to complete the project at hand. In this scenario, you’ll probably get a better result for less money, while Hansson can service many more clients per year, and will therefore also end up better off.

王牌程序员大卫·海涅迈尔·汉森代表着布林约尔松和麦卡菲预测将在新经济中取得成功的第二类人：“超级明星。”高速数据网络和电子邮件、视频会议软件等协作工具摧毁了知识工作的很多领域。比如，现在如果能够聘用汉森那样全球最优秀的程序员用一小段时间完成手头的项目，就没有必要再安排办公空间、支付薪酬福利去聘用全职的程序员了。在这种情况下，你很可能支付更少的钱得到更好的结果，而汉森每年也可以服务更多的客户，变得更有价值。

The fact that Hansson might be working remotely from Marbella, Spain, while your office is in Des Moines, Iowa, doesn’t matter to your company, as advances in communication and collaboration technology make the process near seamless. (This reality does matter, however, to the less-skilled local programmers living in Des Moines and in need of a steady paycheck.) This same trend holds for the growing number of fields where technology makes productive remote work possible—consulting, marketing, writing, design, and so on. Once the talent market is made universally accessible, those at the peak of the market thrive while the rest suffer.

你的办公室在艾奥瓦州的得梅因（Des Moines），而汉森或许远在西班牙的马贝拉远程工作，这其实对你的公司而言并没有什么影响，因为随着通讯和协作科技的发展，整个协同过程几乎可以无缝连接。（然而，这对于那些生活在得梅因、技能略差并需要稳定工资收入的程序员而言就有关系了。）这种趋势在越来越多的领域都开始流行，在这些领域中科技使高效的远程工作成为可能——咨询、市场营销、写作和设计，等等。一旦人才市场可以全球共享，那么在市场顶端的人将会取得成功，而余下的人则会遭遇困境。

In a seminal[^24] 1981 paper, the economist Sherwin Rosen worked out the mathematics behind these “winner-take-all” markets. One of his key insights was to explicitly model talent—labeled, innocuously[^25], with the variable *q* in his formulas—as a factor with “imperfect substitution,” which Rosen explains as follows: “Hearing a succession of mediocre[^26] singers does not add up to a single outstanding performance.” In other words, talent is not a commodity you can buy in bulk and combine to reach the needed levels: There’s a premium to being the best. Therefore, if you’re in a marketplace where the consumer has access to all performers, and everyone’s *q* value is clear, the consumer will choose the very best. Even if the talent advantage of the best is small compared to the next rung[^27] down on the skill ladder, the superstars still win the bulk of the market.

经济学家舍温·罗森（Sherwin Rosen）在 1981 年发表的一篇开创性论文中解出了这种“胜者通吃”市场背后的数学理论。他最核心的见解是明确地将才能（贴上标签、清晰可见的，在公式中用变量 q 表示）定义为一种“不完全替代”因素，罗森就此做出如下解释：“连续听一系列中等水平的歌手唱歌并不能累加成一场无与伦比的演出。”换言之，才能并非一种商品，你不可以通过大批购买，然后累积起来达到一定的水准，只有成为最优秀的才会有额外奖励。因此，如果你身处一个市场，消费者可以找到任何表演者，每个人的 q 值都是清晰的，那么消费者就会选择最好的。即使最优秀的才能相比技能阶梯下一级的才能仅有稍许优势，超级明星仍然会赢得大块市场。

In the 1980s, when Rosen studied this effect, he focused on examples like movie stars and musicians, where there existed clear markets, such as music stores and movie theaters, where an audience has access to different performers and can accurately approximate their talent before making a purchasing decision. The rapid rise of communication and collaboration technologies has transformed many other formerly local markets into a similarly universal bazaar. The small company looking for a computer programmer or public relations consultant now has access to an international marketplace of talent in the same way that the advent of the record store allowed the small-town music fan to bypass local musicians to buy albums from the world’s best bands. The superstar effect, in other words, has a broader application today than Rosen could have predicted thirty years ago. An increasing number of individuals in our economy are now competing with the rock stars of their sectors.

在 20 世纪 80 年代，罗森研究这种现象的时候，他的关注重点在电影明星和音乐家，在这些领域有清晰的市场——比如音乐商店和电影剧院，观众可以接触到各种表演者，在做出购买选择之前准确地评估他们的才能。通讯和协作科技的迅猛发展使过去很多地方性市场转变成类似的全球化集市。一家寻找电脑程序员或公共关系咨询的小公司现在可以利用全球化人才市场达到目的，恰如音像店的出现使小镇的音乐迷可以抛弃本地音乐家去购买全球最棒乐队的专辑。换言之，超级明星效应在当今社会的应用远远超过罗森 30 年前所能预测的范围。在我们的社会经济中，越来越多的个体要与行业中的超级明星竞争。

## The Owners

The final group that will thrive in our new economy—the group epitomized[^28] by John Doerr—consists of those with capital to invest in the new technologies that are driving the Great Restructuring. As we’ve understood since Marx, access to capital provides massive advantages. It’s also true, however, that some periods offer more advantages than others. As Brynjolfsson and McAfee point out, postwar Europe was an example of a bad time to be sitting on a pile of cash, as the combination of rapid inflation and aggressive taxation wiped out old fortunes with surprising speed (what we might call the “Downton Abbey Effect”).

在新经济形势下能够成功的最后一个群体是约翰·杜尔代表的一类人，他们是有资本可以投入新科技、促成大重组的人。从马克思以来，我们都能理解手握资本可以带来巨大的优势。然而在某些阶段手握资本，优势会更加明显。布林约尔松和麦卡菲指出，战后欧洲正是在错误的时间坐拥成堆现金的例子，迅猛的通货膨胀加上严苛的税收政策以惊人的速度抹平了旧资本。（我们或许将其称作“唐顿庄园效应”——“Downton Abbey Effect”。）

The Great Restructuring, unlike the postwar period, *is* a particularly good time to have access to capital. To understand why, first recall that bargaining theory, a key component in standard economic thinking, argues that when money is made through the combination of capital investment and labor, the rewards are returned, roughly speaking, proportional to the input. As digital technology reduces the need for labor in many industries, the proportion of the rewards returned to those who own the intelligent machines is growing. A venture capitalist in today’s economy can fund a company like Instagram, which was eventually sold for a billion dollars, while employing *only thirteen people*. When else in history could such a small amount of labor be involved in such a large amount of value? With so little input from labor, the proportion of this wealth that flows back to the machine owners—in this case, the venture investors—is without precedent[^29]. It’s no wonder that a venture capitalist I interviewed for my last book admitted to me with some concern, “Everyone wants my job.”

大重组时代与战后时期不同，是拥有资本的绝佳时机。想要了解个中原因，首先要回顾一下那个交易理论，它也是标准经济思维的核心组成部分，该理论认为金钱是通过资本投资和劳动力获得的，粗略讲来，回报将与投入成正比。数字科技的发展降低了很多行业对劳动力的需求，因而掌握智能机器之人的回报比例在提高。当今经济下，风投公司会向 Instagram 一类的公司投资，Instagram 最终卖出 10 亿美元，而雇员却仅仅 13 人。历史上有什么时候人们能以如此少的劳动力带来如此巨大的价值？劳动力投入如此之小，回流到智能机器拥有者——在此处是风投投资人——手中的财富却如此之巨，这种现象是史无前例的。难怪我在写作上一本书时采访的一位风投资本家不乏担忧地向我承认：“所有人都想要我的工作。”

Let’s pull together the threads spun so far: Current economic thinking, as I’ve surveyed, argues that the unprecedented growth and impact of technology are creating a massive restructuring of our economy. In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital.

To be clear, this Great Restructuring identified by economists like Brynjolfsson, McAfee, and Cowen is not the *only* economic trend of importance at the moment, and the three groups mentioned previously are not the *only* groups who will do well, but what’s important for this book’s argument is that these trends, even if not alone, *are* important, and these groups, even if they are not the only such groups, *will* thrive. If you can join any of these groups, therefore, you’ll do well. If you cannot, you might still do well, but your position is more precarious[^30].

我们来归纳一下目前所讲的思路：根据我的调研，当下的经济思维认为，史无前例的科技发展和影响力为我们的经济带来了巨大的重组。在这种新经济形势下，有三种人将获得特别的优势：可以利用智能机器把工作做得漂亮并具有创造性的，在所处行业中最优秀的，还有那些拥有资本的。在此要说明一点，布林约尔松、麦卡菲和考恩等经济学家所发现的大重组并非当前唯一重要的经济趋势，也并不是只有上述三个群体能够取得杰出的成就。但是本书的一个重要论点在于，尽管这些确实并非独有，但也是重要的，而这些群体——即便并非唯一的此类群体，也将取得成功。因此，如果你能成为其中任何一个群体的一员，你都会有出众的表现。如果不能，你或许也会有好的表现，但是你的地位会岌岌可危。

The question we must now face is the obvious one: How does one join these winners? At the risk of quelling[^31] your rising enthusiasm, I should first confess that I have no secret for quickly amassing[^32] capital and becoming the next John Doerr. (If I had such secrets, it’s unlikely I’d share them in a book.) The other two winning groups, however, are accessible. How to access them is the goal we tackle next.

我们现在必须面对的问题已经很明晰：如何加入到这些成功者的群体中？冒着打消诸位不断高涨的热情的风险，我还是要先承认，我没有任何秘诀可以帮助你迅速积累财富，成为下一位约翰·杜尔。（如果我有这样的秘诀，也不太可能会在一本书中分享。）然而，进入另外两个赢家群体则是可实现的，这也是我们在下文中要解决的目标。


## How to Become a Winner in the New Economy

I just identified two groups that are poised[^33] to thrive and that I claim are accessible: those who can work creatively with intelligent machines and those who are stars in their field. What’s the secret to landing in these lucrative sectors of the widening digital divide? I argue that the following two core abilities are crucial.

我发现有两类人注定会成功，而且我认为可以推广借鉴：一种是能够利用智能机器进行创造性工作的，一种是自己所在领域的个中翘楚。在数字鸿沟不断扩大的当下，有什么窍门能够为进入此类有利领域提供助力？我认为如下两种核心能力是关键。


### Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy

1. The ability to quickly master hard things. (迅速掌握复杂工具的能力)
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed. (在工作质量和速度方面都达到精英层次的能力)

Let’s begin with the first ability. To start, we must remember that we’ve been spoiled by the intuitive and drop-dead-simple user experience of many consumer-facing technologies, like Twitter and the iPhone. These examples, however, are consumer products, not serious tools: Most of the intelligent machines driving the Great Restructuring are significantly more complex to understand and master.

我们先来探讨一下第一种能力。开始之前先要提醒一下，像推特和 iPhone 一类用户友好型的傻瓜科技已经把我们惯坏了。然而这些只能算作消费品，根本谈不上真正的工具：引导大重组的智能机器大多数都非常复杂，很难理解和掌握。

Consider Nate Silver, our earlier example of someone who thrives by working well with complicated technology. If we dive deeper into his methodology, we discover that generating data-driven election forecasts is not as easy as typing “Who will win more votes?” into a search box. He instead maintains a large database of poll results (thousands of polls from more than 250 pollsters[^34]) that he feeds into Stata, a popular statistical analysis system produced by a company called StataCorp. These are not easy tools to master. Here, for example, is the type of command you need to understand to work with a modern database like Silver uses:

回想一下我们在前文中举例靠熟练掌握复杂科技而取得成功时提到的内特·西尔弗。如果我们深入发掘一下他使用的方法，就会发现生成数据驱动的选举结果预测并不像在搜索框中输入“谁将获得更多选票？”那么简单。实际上他汇集了一个大型民调结果数据库（从 250 个民意调查机构处获取的数千项民意调查结果），然后输入到 Stata 软件中（Stata 是一种很流行的数据分析系统，由一家名为 StataCorp 的公司研发）。此类工具并不容易掌握，比如，想要利用类似西尔弗使用的现代数据库工作，你就需要理解下面一类命令：

```sql
CREATE VIEW cities AS SELECT name, population, altitude FROM capitals UNION SELECT name, population, altitude FROM non_capitals;
```

Databases of this type are interrogated in a language called SQL. You send them commands like the one shown here to interact with their stored information. Understanding how to manipulate these databases is subtle. The example command, for example, creates a “view”: a virtual database table that pulls together data from multiple existing tables, and that can then be addressed by the SQL commands like a standard table. When to create views and how to do so well is a tricky question, one of many that you must understand and master to tease reasonable results out of real-world databases.

此类数据库汇编成一种语言，称作 SQL。你利用如上所列的命令与数据库中储存的信息进行交流。想要操控此类数据库是一项非常精深的工作。比如上面一条命令会创建一种“视图”：一种从现有多种表中选取汇集数据的虚拟数据库表，该表可成为标准表利用 SQL 核心进行基元处理。何时创建视图，如何熟练创建视图是个很微妙的问题，如果想要在现实世界的数据库中梳理出理性的结果，你需要理解和掌握的事情很多，上述便是其中一例。

Sticking with our Nate Silver case study, consider the other technology he relies on: Stata. This is a powerful tool, and definitely not something you can learn intuitively after some modest tinkering[^35]. Here, for example, is a description of the features added to the most recent version of this software: “Stata 13 adds many new features such as treatment effects, multilevel GLM, power and sample size, generalized SEM, forecasting, effect sizes, Project Manager, long strings and BLOBs, and much more.” Silver uses this complex software—with its generalized SEM and BLOBs—to build intricate[^36] models with interlocking parts: multiple regressions, conducted on custom parameters, which are then referenced as custom weights used in probabilistic expressions, and so on.

我们还继续分析内特·西尔弗的例子，思考一下他依赖的另一项科技：Stata。这是一种非常强大的工具，不可能靠着本能随便动动脑就能学会。比如下面一段话描述的是这种软件最新版本的一些新特性：“Stata13 加入了很多新特性，比如处理效果、多层广义线性模型（GLM）、检验效能和样本数、广义结构方程模型（SEM），预测、效应值、项目管理器、长字符串和 BLOBs（二进制大对象）以及其他很多。”西尔弗利用此类复杂的软件（包含广义结构方程模型和 BlOBs）创建复杂的模型，内含各种互相联系的部分：比如自定义参数的多元线性回归，就可以在概率算式中用来做顾客权重参考，等等。

The point of providing these details is to emphasize that intelligent machines are complicated and hard to master. To join the group of those who can work well with these machines, therefore, requires that you hone your ability to master hard things. And because these technologies change rapidly, this process of mastering hard things never ends: You must be able to do it quickly, again and again.

这些细节旨在强调智能机器的复杂性是难以掌握的。[^37]因此，要想较好地运用这些机器，你就要培养出掌握复杂事物的能力。而且由于这些科技变化很快，掌握复杂事物的过程便永远不会结束：你必须能够快速完成，一次又一次。

This ability to learn hard things quickly, of course, isn’t just necessary for working well with intelligent machines; it also plays a key role in the attempt to become a superstar in just about any field—even those that have little to do with technology. To become a world-class yoga instructor, for example, requires that you master an increasingly complex set of physical skills. To excel in a particular area of medicine, to give another example, requires that you be able to quickly master the latest research on relevant procedures. To summarize these observations more succinctly: If you can’t learn, you can’t thrive.

当然，这种迅速掌握复杂事物的能力并不仅仅是能熟练运用智能机器所必需的；基本上也是想要成为任何领域的超级明星的关键因素，即便是与科技关联性很小的领域。比如，想要成为一名世界级的瑜伽训练师，就要求你掌握愈发复杂的身体技能组合。再举一个例子，想要在某个特定的医学领域取得成功，就要求你能快速掌握相关程序的最新研究成果。用更简洁的语言总结这些观察结果就是：如果你无法学习，就无法成功。

Now consider the second core ability from the list shown earlier: producing at an elite level. If you want to become a superstar, mastering the relevant skills is necessary, but not sufficient. You must then transform that latent[^38] potential into tangible results that people value. Many developers, for example, can program computers well, but David Hansson, our example superstar from earlier, leveraged[^39] this ability to produce Ruby on Rails, the project that made his reputation. Ruby on Rails required Hansson to push his current skills to their limit and produce unambiguously valuable and concrete results.

现在思考之前所提的第二项核心能力：达到精英水平。如果你想成为领域中的翘楚，掌握相关技能是必需的，但并不够。之后你必须将潜能转化成人们珍视的实在成果。比如，很多程序员对编程都很在行，但是我此前举例的超级明星大卫·汉森能利用这种能力创造出 Ruby on Rails，正是这个项目为他带来了声誉。Ruby on Rails 要求汉森将他当前的技能推向极限，创造出实在的价值和成果。

This ability to produce also applies to those looking to master intelligent machines. It wasn’t enough for Nate Silver to learn how to manipulate large data sets and run statistical analyses; he needed to then show that he could use this skill to tease information from these machines that a large audience cared about. Silver worked with many stats geeks during his days at *Baseball Prospectus*, but it was Silver alone who put in the effort to adapt these skills to the new and more lucrative territory of election forecasting. This provides another general observation for joining the ranks of winners in our economy: If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no matter how skilled or talented you are.

这种产出的能力同时也适用于以掌握智能机器为目标的人。对于内特·西尔弗而言，学会如何掌控大型数据组和进行数据分析并不够；他还需要证明自己能够利用这种技能，从这些机器中提取大众关注的信息。西尔弗在棒球资料（Baseball Prospectus）工作期间与很多数据极客共事过，但是只有他努力将这些技能加以调整，用于全新的、更有利可图的选举预测领域。由此我们总结出想要加入当前经济形势下赢家群体的另一项要点：如果你不产出，就不会成功，不管你的技艺多么纯熟，天资多么聪颖。

Having established two abilities that are fundamental to getting ahead in our new, technology-disrupted world, we can now ask the obvious follow-up question: How does one cultivate these core abilities? It’s here that we arrive at a central thesis of this book: The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work. If you haven’t mastered this foundational skill, you’ll struggle to learn hard things or produce at an elite level.

我们已经列出两种在当今这个由科技分化的新世界里获得成功的能力，现在可以提一个显而易见的后续问题：如何才能培养出这些核心能力？讲到这里，我们便触及了本书的核心主题：上文阐述的两种核心能力依赖于你进行深度工作的能力。如果你没有掌握这项基本能力，想要学习艰涩的知识或达到精英水平就会很挣扎。

The dependence of these abilities on deep work isn’t immediately obvious; it requires a closer look at the science of learning, concentration, and productivity. The sections ahead provide this closer look, and by doing so will help this connection between deep work and economic success shift for you from unexpected to unimpeachable[^40].

这些能力对于深度工作的依赖性并非即时显现的，这要求我们更深入地探究与学习、专注和生产力相关的科学。接下来的章节将做深入探究，使深度工作和经济成功之间的这种联系为你转变——从意料之外到无懈可击。


## Deep Work Helps You Quickly Learn Hard Things

“Let your mind become a lens, thanks to the converging rays of attention; let your soul be all intent on whatever it is that is established in your mind as a dominant, wholly absorbing idea.”

“让你的头脑成为透镜，汇聚专注之光；让你的灵魂完全投入到头脑中的主导之物上，尽情吸收思想。”

This advice comes from Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges, a Dominican friar[^41] and professor of moral philosophy, who during the early part of the twentieth century penned a slim but influential volume titled *The Intellectual Life*. Sertillanges wrote the book as a guide to “the development and deepening of the mind” for those called to make a living in the world of ideas. Throughout *The Intellectual Life*, Sertillanges recognizes the necessity of mastering complicated material and helps prepare the reader for this challenge. For this reason, his book proves useful in our quest to better understand how people quickly master hard (cognitive) skills.

上述建议出自多米尼加（Dominican）修士、伦理哲学教授安东尼-达尔梅斯·塞汀朗吉思（Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges），他在 20 世纪初期写作了一本很薄却非常有影响力的小册子，名为《知性生活》（The Intellectual Life）。塞汀朗吉思写作这本书，旨在引导那些在思想界求生存的人“培养和深化自己的头脑”。塞汀朗吉思在《知性生活》中充分认识到掌握复杂材料的必要性，帮助读者为这类挑战做好准备。因为这个原因，这本书恰好契合我们的诉求，有助于我们更好地理解人类如何快速掌握复杂（认知性）技能。

To understand Sertillanges’s advice, let’s return to the quote from earlier. In these words, which are echoed in many forms in *The Intellectual Life*, Sertillanges argues that to advance your understanding of your field you must tackle the relevant topics systematically, allowing your “converging rays of attention” to uncover the truth latent in each. In other words, he teaches: *To learn requires intense concentration*. This idea turns out to be ahead of its time. In reflecting on the life of the mind in the 1920s, Sertillanges uncovered a fact about mastering cognitively demanding tasks that would take academia another seven decades to formalize.

为了理解塞汀朗吉思的建议，我们先回顾早先引用的那一段话。在这些文字中（在《知性生活》中有多种形式的回应）塞汀朗吉思称想要提升对自己所在领域的理解，你就必须系统地处理相关主题，做到“汇聚专注之光”，以发现每一处深藏的真理。换言之，他教导读者：学习需要深度专注。这种观念已经使他领先于时代。塞汀朗吉思反思 20 世纪 20 年代的思想生活，发现了关乎如何掌握有认知要求任务的一点事实，而这点事实直到 70 年后才得到学术界的正式定义。

This task of formalization began in earnest[^42] in the 1970s, when a branch of psychology, sometimes called performance psychology, began to systematically explore what separates experts (in many different fields) from everyone else. In the early 1990s, K. Anders Ericsson, a professor at Florida State University, pulled together these strands into a single coherent answer, consistent with the growing research literature, that he gave a punchy[^43] name: deliberate practice.

学术界真正将其规范化的过程始于 20 世纪 70 年代，心理学的一个分支——有时被人们称作表现心理学——开始系统地探究哪些因素区分了专家（在很多不同的领域）和其他人。到 90 年代初期，佛罗里达州立大学教授 K.安德斯·艾利克森（K. Anders Ericsson）汇总了所有这些思路，结合了不断累积的研究文献，形成一个清晰的答案，并给出一个很有冲击力的概念：刻意练习（Deliberate Practice）。

Ericsson opens his seminal paper on the topic with a powerful claim: “We deny that these differences [between expert performers and normal adults] are immutable… Instead, we argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.”

艾利克森在该主题上的开创性论文开篇有一个强有力的论断：“我们拒绝接受这些（专家与普通成年人之间的）差异是不可改变的……相反，我们认为专家与普通成年人之间的差异反映的是，为提升某一特定领域的表现穷其一生的刻意努力。”

American culture, in particular, loves the storyline of the prodigy (“Do you know how easy this is for me!?” Matt Damon’s character famously cries in the movie *Good Will Hunting* as he makes quick work of proofs that stymie[^44] the world’s top mathematicians). The line of research promoted by Ericsson, and now widely accepted (with caveats), de-stabilizes these myths. To master a cognitively demanding task requires this specific form of practice—there are few exceptions made for natural talent. (On this point too, Sertillanges seems to have been ahead of his time, arguing in *The Intellectual Life*, “Men of genius themselves were great only by bringing all their power to bear on the point on which they had decided to show their full measure.” Ericsson couldn’t have said it better.)

美国文化尤其钟爱神童一类的故事情节（“你知道这对我来说多么简单吗？！”马特·达蒙在《心灵捕手》中扮演的角色迅速解出困扰世界顶级数学家的问题之后讲出这段广为人知的话）。艾利克森的研究方向现在已经广为世人接受（有质疑[^45]），它动摇了这种神话。掌握有认知性要求的任务需要这种特定形式的训练，只有极少的天才是个例。（在这一点上塞汀朗吉思也同样超越了所处的时代，他在《知性生活》中称：“天才之人之所以伟大，只因决心投入一切，全力于一点。”艾利克森也难有更好的表述。）

This brings us to the question of what deliberate practice actually requires. Its core components are usually identified as follows: (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive. The first component is of particular importance to our discussion, as it emphasizes that deliberate practice cannot exist alongside distraction, and that it instead requires uninterrupted concentration. As Ericsson emphasizes, “Diffused attention is almost antithetical to the *focused attention* required by deliberate practice” (emphasis mine).

此时摆在我们面前的问题，就是刻意练习到底有哪些要求。其核心要素通常如下：（1）你的注意力全情投入到某个你希望提升的技能或想要掌握的理念上；（2）你能得到反馈意见，这样你就可以调整自己的方法，保持注意力的投入有最佳产出。第一个要素对于我们的探讨尤为重要，因其强调了刻意练习不能在有干扰的情况下进行，要求在无干扰状态下保持专注。恰如艾利克森所强调的：“注意力涣散基本上与刻意练习要求的聚精会神是相对立的。”（强调的语气是我加入的）

As psychologists, Ericsson and the other researchers in his field are not interested in *why* deliberate practice works; they’re just identifying it as an effective behavior. In the intervening decades since Ericsson’s first major papers on the topic, however, neuroscientists have been exploring the physical mechanisms that drive people’s improvements on hard tasks. As the journalist Daniel Coyle surveys in his 2009 book, *The Talent Code*, these scientists increasingly believe the answer includes myelin—a layer of fatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster and cleaner. To understand the role of myelin in improvement, keep in mind that skills, be they intellectual or physical, eventually reduce down to brain circuits. This new science of performance argues that you get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around the relevant neurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and effectively. To be great at something is to be well myelinated.

作为心理学家，艾利克森和其他该领域的研究者对于刻意练习为何有效并不感兴趣，他们仅仅是辨识其为一种有效的行为。然而，在其间的 10 年里，神经科学家一直在探索促使人类在解决难题方面取得进步的科学原理。记者丹尼尔·科伊尔（Daniel Coyle）在他 2009 年出版的《一万小时天才理论》（The Talent Code）一书中调查发现，越来越多的科学家认为**刻意练习有效的原因与髓磷脂相关**，它是在神经元周围生长的一层脂肪组织，起到绝缘保护的作用，可保持神经元干净和正常运转。要理解髓磷脂在提升能力方面的作用，首先要记住，不管是智力还是体力方面的技能，最终都要追溯到大脑回路上。这种新的性能科学认为，如果相关神经元周围汇集了更多的髓磷脂，相应的大脑回路就能更轻松有效地运转，你在某方面的技能就会更强。想要在某方面有了不起的成就，就需要有更多髓磷脂的协助。

This understanding is important because it provides a neurological foundation for why deliberate practice works. By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you’re forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation. This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits—effectively cementing the skill. The reason, therefore, why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination. By contrast, if you’re trying to learn a complex new skill (say, SQL database management) in a state of low concentration (perhaps you also have your Facebook feed open), you’re firing too many circuits simultaneously and haphazardly to isolate the group of neurons you actually want to strengthen.

这种理解为刻意练习的有效性提供了神经学基础。专注于某一项特定技能，就会迫使某一特定大脑回路在隔离的区域不断地燃烧。反复利用同一大脑回路，就能促使少突细胞在这个回路的神经元周围包裹髓磷脂，从而有效地固化这种技能。因此，要想高度专注于当前任务，避免干扰非常重要，因为这是充分隔离相关神经回路、促进髓磷脂鞘形成的唯一途径。与之相对，如果你尝试在注意力涣散的情况下（或许脸谱网的推送消息还开着）学习一种复杂的新技能（比如 SQL 数据库管理），就会有太多的回路同时进行，你真正希望强化的神经元群只能得到偶尔的隔离。

In the century that has passed since Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges first wrote about using the mind like a lens to focus rays of attention, we have advanced from this elevated metaphor to a decidedly less poetic explanation expressed in terms of oligodendrocyte cells. But this sequence of thinking about thinking points to an inescapable conclusion: To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction. To learn, in other words, is an act of deep work. If you’re comfortable going deep, you’ll be comfortable mastering the increasingly complex systems and skills needed to thrive in our economy. If you instead remain one of the many for whom depth is uncomfortable and distraction ubiquitous, you shouldn’t expect these systems and skills to come easily to you.

距塞汀朗吉思第一次写出“让你的头脑成为透镜，汇聚专注之光”的文字之后，一个世纪过去了，我们已经将这种形而上的比喻发展为一种不那么富有诗意的少突细胞解释，这也引出一个必然的结论：想要迅速掌握困难的事物，你必须高度专注，不能有任何干扰。换言之，学习是一种深度工作行为。如果你很容易做到深度工作，就能轻松掌握愈发复杂的体系和技能，这些体系和技能是我们在经济生活中取得成功所必需的。如果你还是一个难以做到深度工作的人，要面对无处不在的干扰，就不应期待轻易掌握这些体系和技能。

## Deep Work Helps You Produce at an Elite Level

Adam Grant produces at an elite level. When I met Grant in 2013, he was the youngest professor to be awarded tenure at the Wharton School of Business at Penn. A year later, when I started writing this chapter (and was just beginning to think about my own tenure process), the claim was updated: He’s now the youngest *full professor*[*](footnotes.xhtml#fn0003fn) at Wharton.

亚当·格兰特（Adam Grant）有着精英级的产出。我在 2013 年遇见格兰特的时候，他是获得宾夕法尼亚大学沃顿商学院最年轻的教授。一年之后，我开始写作本章时（也正在这时开始思考我自己的教职问题），他的头衔又发生了变化——沃顿商学院最年轻的正教授（full professor）[^46]。

The reason Grant advanced so quickly in his corner of academia is simple: He produces. In 2012, Grant published seven articles—all of them in major journals. This is an absurdly high rate for his field (in which professors tend to work alone or in small professional collaborations and do not have large teams of students and postdocs to support their research). In 2013, this count fell to five. This is still absurdly high, but below his recent standards. He can be excused for this dip, however, because this same year he published a book titled *Give and Take*, which popularized some of his research on relationships in business. To say that this book was successful is an understatement. It ended up featured on the cover of the *New York Times Magazine* and went on to become a massive bestseller. When Grant was awarded full professorship in 2014, he had already written more than sixty peer-reviewed publications in addition to his bestselling book.

格兰特之所以能够在学术界迅速崭露头角，原因很简单：他有产出。2012 年，格兰特发表了 7 篇论文，全部发表于重要期刊。在他所属的领域（在这个领域，教授通常独立开展工作或进行小范围职业合作，但是很少有大批量的学生和博士后协助他们完成研究），这是个高到离谱的数量。2013 年，论文数为 5 篇。这个数量也高得离谱，但还是低于他此前的水准。然而，发表论文数量之所以下降也有其原因，因为这一年他出版了一本名为《沃顿商学院最受欢迎的成功课》（Give and Take）的书，将他在商业人际关系方面的研究推向大众。仅仅说这是一本成功的书已经是对其低估了。这本书最后登上《纽约时报》杂志封面，成为超级畅销书。2014 年，格兰特受聘成为正教授时，他已经发表了 60 多篇同行评审论著，外加这一本畅销书。

Soon after meeting Grant, my own academic career on my mind, I couldn’t help but ask him about his productivity. Fortunately for me, he was happy to share his thoughts on the subject. It turns out that Grant thinks a lot about the mechanics of producing at an elite level. He sent me, for example, a collection of PowerPoint slides from a workshop he attended with several other professors in his field. The event was focused on data-driven observations about how to produce academic work at an optimum rate. These slides included detailed pie charts of time allocation per season, a flowchart capturing relationship development with co-authors, and a suggested reading list with more than twenty titles. These business professors do not live the cliché of the absentminded academic lost in books and occasionally stumbling on a big idea. They see productivity as a scientific problem to systematically solve—a goal Adam Grant seems to have achieved.

与格兰特会面后不久，我心里惦记着自己的学术生涯问题，忍不住问他是如何做到如此高产出的。所幸，他很愿意分享在这方面的心得。原来格兰特深入思考了如何实现精英级产出的机理。他给我发了一系列幻灯片，是他与同领域数位专家参加研讨会时使用的。研讨会聚焦于如何使学术工作达到最佳状态的数据导向观察。这些幻灯片中有详细的每季时间分配饼形图，与共同作者关系发展的流程图，还有一个推荐阅读书单，上面有 20 多本推荐阅读书籍。这些商学教授没有墨守成规地会将书本知识照章全收，而是偶尔冒出一个了不起的主意。他们将产出看作一种科学问题，需要系统化解决，而亚当·格兰特似乎已经达成了这个目标。

Though Grant’s productivity depends on many factors, there’s one idea in particular that seems central to his method: the batching of hard but important intellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches. Grant performs this batching at multiple levels. Within the year, he stacks his teaching into the fall semester, during which he can turn all of his attention to teaching well and being available to his students. (This method seems to work, as Grant is currently the highest-rated teacher at Wharton and the winner of multiple teaching awards.) By batching his teaching in the fall, Grant can then turn his attention fully to research in the spring and summer, and tackle this work with less distraction.

尽管格兰特的产出得益于多方面因素，但是有一种理念似乎在他的方法中占据了核心地位：在长时间无干扰的状态下，批量解决困难却重要的智力工作。格兰特在多层面展开这种批量工作模式。在一年的时间里，他将教学工作集中到秋季学期，期间可以将全部精力投入到好好教学上，保证学生能够找到他。（这种方法看起来是有效的，因为格兰特现在被沃顿商学院评为表现最优的教师，荣获多项教学奖励。）将教学工作集中在秋季之后，格兰特就可以在春夏两季将全部精力投入到研究工作中，处理工作的过程中少了很多干扰。

Grant also batches his attention on a smaller time scale. Within a semester dedicated to research, he alternates between periods where his door is open to students and colleagues, and periods where he isolates himself to focus completely and without distraction on a single research task. (He typically divides the writing of a scholarly paper into three discrete tasks: analyzing the data, writing a full draft, and editing the draft into something publishable.) During these periods, which can last up to three or four days, he’ll often put an out-of-office auto-responder on his e-mail so correspondents will know not to expect a response. “It sometimes confuses my colleagues,” he told me. “They say, ‘You’re not out of office, I see you in your office right now!’” But to Grant, it’s important to enforce strict isolation until he completes the task at hand.

格兰特还经常在较短的时间段内批量分配精力。在专注于研究工作的学期内，他会在两种状态下转换，有些阶段会向学生和同事敞开大门，有些阶段则会与世隔绝，全情专注于某一项研究任务，不受任何干扰。（他通常将学术论文的写作分为三个独立的阶段：分析数据，写成完整的草稿，编辑草稿形成可出版的文章。）在这段可能持续三四天的时间里，他经常为电子邮箱设定不在办公室的自动回复，这样来信人就知道不会得到回应。“有时这种做法会令我的同事感到困惑。他们说：‘你没有离开办公室啊，我现在就看着你在办公室里！’”但是对于格兰特而言，完成手头的任务之前做到彻底与世隔绝是非常重要的。

My guess is that Adam Grant doesn’t work substantially more hours than the average professor at an elite research institution (generally speaking, this is a group prone to workaholism), but he still manages to produce more than just about anyone else in his field. I argue that his approach to batching helps explain this paradox. In particular, by consolidating his work into intense and uninterrupted pulses, he’s leveraging the following law of productivity:

我猜亚当·格兰特的工作时间比一般精英研究所里的教授（这些人通常都是工作狂）要少很多，但是他的产出还是比领域内几乎所有人都高。我认为他批量处理工作的方式有助于解释这种矛盾现象。尤其有效的是他将工作合并为密集而无干扰的脉冲，充分利用了下述生产力规律：

> High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) ✖️ (Intensity of Focus)
>
> 高质量工作产出=时间×专注度

If you believe this formula, then Grant’s habits make sense: By maximizing his intensity when he works, he maximizes the results he produces per unit of time spent working.

This is not the first time I’ve encountered this formulaic conception of productivity. It first came to my attention when I was researching my second book, *How to Become a Straight-A Student*, many years earlier. During that research process, I interviewed around fifty ultra-high-scoring college undergraduates from some of the country’s most competitive schools. Something I noticed in these interviews is that the very best students often studied less than the group of students right below them on the GPA rankings. One of the explanations for this phenomenon turned out to be the formula detailed earlier: The best students understood the role intensity plays in productivity and therefore went out of their way to maximize their concentration—radically reducing the time required to prepare for tests or write papers, without diminishing the quality of their results.

如果你相信这个公式，那么格兰特的习惯就有理可循了：工作时专注度达到最高，单位时间里的工作产出也将实现最大化。这并非我第一次遇到生产力公式的概念。我第一次接触这个概念是在第二本书《如何成为尖子生》（How to Become a Straight-A Student）的调研期间。在调研中，我采访了全国一些竞争最激烈学校里的 50 名超高分研究生。采访中我注意到最优秀的学生通常比 GPA 等级低一档的学生用在学习上的时间更短。上文提及的公式恰可作为这种现象的一种解释：最优秀的学生能够理解专注度在产出方面起到的作用，因此会极度专注，从而大幅减少考试准备或撰写论文所需的时间，同时也不降低成果的质量。

The example of Adam Grant implies that this intensity formula applies beyond just undergraduate GPA and is also relevant to other cognitively demanding tasks. But why would this be? An interesting explanation comes from Sophie Leroy, a business professor at the University of Minnesota. In a 2009 paper, titled, intriguingly, “Why Is It So Hard to Do My Work?,” Leroy introduced an effect she called *attention residue*. In the introduction to this paper, she noted that other researchers have studied the effect of multitasking—trying to accomplish multiple tasks simultaneously—on performance, but that in the modern knowledge work office, once you got to a high enough level, it was more common to find people working on multiple projects sequentially: “Going from one meeting to the next, starting to work on one project and soon after having to transition to another is just part of life in organizations,” Leroy explains.

The problem this research identifies with this work strategy is that when you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn’t immediately follow—a *residue* of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task. This residue gets especially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and of low intensity before you switched, but even if you finish Task A before moving on, your attention remains divided for a while.

Leroy studied the effect of this attention residue on performance by forcing task switches in the laboratory. In one such experiment, for example, she started her subjects working on a set of word puzzles. In one of the trials, she would interrupt them and tell them that they needed to move on to a new and challenging task, in this case, reading résumés and making hypothetical hiring decisions. In other trials, she let the subjects finish the puzzles before giving them the next task. In between puzzling and hiring, she would deploy a quick lexical decision game to quantify the amount of residue left from the first task. The results from this and her similar experiments were clear: “People experiencing attention residue after switching tasks are likely to demonstrate poor performance on that next task,” and the more intense the residue, the worse the performance.

The concept of attention residue helps explain why the intensity formula is true and therefore helps explain Grant’s productivity. By working on a single hard task for a long time without switching, Grant minimizes the negative impact of attention residue from his other obligations, allowing him to maximize performance on this one task. When Grant is working for days in isolation on a paper, in other words, he’s doing so at a higher level of effectiveness than the standard professor following a more distracted strategy in which the work is repeatedly interrupted by residue-slathering interruptions.

亚当·格兰特的例子意味着专注度的公式不仅仅适用于研究生的 GPA，同时也适用于其他有认知度要求的任务。但为什么是这样呢？明尼苏达大学商业学教授索菲·勒鲁瓦（Sophie Leroy）对此有一种很有趣的解释。勒鲁瓦在 2009 年发表的一篇题名很有趣的论文“为什么完成工作那么难？”（Why Is It So Hard to Do My Work ？）中介绍了一种她称之为“注意力残留”（Attention Residue）的效应。在这篇论文的前言中她特别提到，其他研究者已经研究过多任务处理对工作表现的影响，但是在现代知识工作者的工作中，一旦级别达到一定高度，通常会按次序完成多项工作：“一项会议结束后开始另一项会议，开始一个项目的某项工作后不久没有任何过渡便开始另外一项工作，这些都是组织生活的一部分。”勒鲁瓦解释道。这项研究发现这种工作策略存在一个问题，当你从某项任务 A 转移到任务 B 时，你的注意力并没有即时转移，你的注意力残留仍然在思考原始任务。如果在转移工作之前，你对任务 A 缺乏控制且关注度较低，残留会尤其浓厚，但即使你在转移工作之前已经完成了任务 A，你的注意力还是会有一段分散的时间。勒鲁瓦在实验室中强制进行任务转换，以此研究这种注意力残留对工作表现的影响。比如，在一项实验中，她先请研究对象解一些文字谜题。在某次实验里，她会打断研究对象，要求他们转移到一项新的、具有挑战性的任务上，此次是阅读简历，做出假定的聘用决定。在其他几次实验里，她请研究对象完成谜题之后再开始新任务。在文字谜题和聘用之间，她会安排一次快速的词汇判断游戏，以此量化第一项任务的残留量。[^47]此项实验以及其他类似实验的结果很清晰：“转换任务之后处于注意力残留状态的人，在下一项任务中的表现通常很差而且残留量越大，表现越糟糕。”注意力残留的概念有助于解释专注度公式的真实性，因此也有助于解释格兰特的高效产出。格兰特长时间不转移注意力，完成单一困难任务，使注意力残留负面影响降到最低，从而使他在当前任务上的表现成果最优化。换言之，当格兰特与世隔绝数日完成一篇论文时，其效率水平远高于奉行多任务策略的一般教授，这些教授的工作反复受到残留量极大的干扰。

Even if you’re unable to fully replicate Grant’s extreme isolation (we’ll tackle different strategies for scheduling depth in Part 2), the attention residue concept is still telling because it implies that the common habit of working in a state of semi-distraction is potentially devastating to your performance. It might seem harmless to take a quick glance at your inbox every ten minutes or so. Indeed, many justify this behavior as *better* than the old practice of leaving an inbox open on the screen at all times (a straw-man habit that few follow anymore). But Leroy teaches us that this is not in fact much of an improvement. That quick check introduces a new target for your attention. Even worse, by seeing messages that you cannot deal with at the moment (which is almost always the case), you’ll be forced to turn back to the primary task with a secondary task left unfinished. The attention residue left by such unresolved switches dampens your performance.

即便你无法如格兰特一般做到完全与世隔绝（我们将在第二部分中介绍实现深度工作的多种策略），但是注意力残留的概念还是有其警醒作用的，因为这预示着在有干扰的状态下工作，对你的表现是有潜在危害的。每隔10分钟左右瞥一眼收件箱或许看似没有损害，很多人还试图证明这种行为优于时刻保持收件箱开启状态的旧习惯（已经很少有人坚持的一种坏习惯）。但是勒鲁瓦告诉我们这种做法并不是一种进步。更糟糕的是，看到一些当前无法解决的信息（几乎总是这样），你就被迫回到最初的任务上，但是又有第二项任务留在脑后没有完成。这种未完成任务之间的转换带来的注意力残留对你的表现十分有害。

When we step back from these individual observations, we see a clear argument form: To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. Put another way, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work. If you’re not comfortable going deep for extended periods of time, it’ll be difficult to get your performance to the peak levels of quality and quantity increasingly necessary to thrive professionally. Unless your talent and skills absolutely dwarf those of your competition, the deep workers among them will outproduce you.

我们从这些对个体的观察退回一步看，就能发现一种清晰的论点：要达到个人巅峰的产出效率，你需要长时间、无干扰地高度专注于单一任务。换一种说法，使你的表现最优化的做法是深度工作。如果你无法做到长时间深度工作，就很难使你的表现达到质量和数量的巅峰，而这种巅峰状态对于你的职业成功越来越重要。除非你的才能和技能全面压制对手，否则对手中的深度工作者定将超越你的表现。

## What About Jack Dorsey?

I’ve now made my argument for why deep work supports abilities that are becoming increasingly important in our economy. Before we accept this conclusion, however, we must face a type of question that often arises when I discuss this topic: *What about Jack Dorsey?*

至此我已经论证了为什么深度工作在当今经济形势下变得越来越重要。但是，在我们接受这项结论之前，必须面对一类问题，这类问题经常在我探讨这个主题时被人提起：杰克·多西（Jack Dorsey）是怎么回事？

Jack Dorsey helped found Twitter. After stepping down as CEO, he then launched the payment-processing company Square. To quote a Forbes profile: “He is a disrupter on a massive scale and a repeat offender.” He is also someone who does not spend a lot of time in a state of deep work. Dorsey doesn’t have the luxury of long periods of uninterrupted thinking because, at the time when the Forbes profile was written, he maintained management duties at both Twitter (where he remained chairman) and Square, leading to a tightly calibrated schedule that ensures that the companies have a predictable “weekly cadence” (and that also ensures that Dorsey’s time and attention are severely fractured).

杰克·多西参与创建了推特，从首席执行官的职位上退出之后，他又创建了移动支付公司 Squre。引用《福布斯》杂志对他的介绍：“他是个非常不安分的人，不断制造各种麻烦。”此外他也并没有多少时间处于深度工作状态。多西没有长时间不受干扰思考的奢侈机会，在《福布斯》为他撰写个人介绍时，他要承担推特（当时还是主席）和 Square 两家公司的日常管理工作，因此日程表极为精细，以确保公司有可预期的“每周例行事务”（它们使多西的时间和精力极度分散）。

Dorsey reports, for example, that he ends the average day with thirty to forty sets of meeting notes that he reviews and filters at night. In the small spaces between all these meetings, he believes in serendipitous availability. “I do a lot of my work at stand-up tables, which anyone can come up to,” Dorsey said. “I get to hear all these conversations around the company.”

比如，多西称他平均每天晚上睡前要审阅和批示 30～40 条会议记录。白天他充分利用这些会议间隙的宝贵时间来工作。“我有很多工作都会在站桌旁完成，任何人都可以来这里工作，”多西说，“这能够让我了解公司里的各种声音。”

This style of work is not deep. To use a term from our previous section, Dorsey’s attention residue is likely slathered on thick as he darts from one meeting to another, letting people interrupt him freely in the brief interludes in between. And yet, we cannot say that Dorsey’s work is shallow, because shallow work, as defined in the introduction, is low value and easily replicable, while what Jack Dorsey does is incredibly valuable and highly rewarded in our economy (as of this writing he was among the top one thousand richest people in the world, with a net worth over $1.1 billion).

这种类型的工作并非深度工作。用前文中的说法，多西在不同的会议中穿梭，还允许其他人在会间短暂的间隙随意打断他，其注意力残留极高。然而，我们并不能说多西的工作是浮浅的，因为正如前言中定义的，浮浅工作价值低，容易复制，而杰克·多西所做的工作有无限的价值，而且在我们的社会经济中得到了巨额回报（在写作本书时，他身处全球最富有的千人之列，净资产超过 11 亿美元）。

Jack Dorsey is important to our discussion because he’s an exemplar of a group we cannot ignore: individuals who thrive without depth. When I titled the motivating question of this section “What About Jack Dorsey?,” I was providing a specific example of a more general query: If deep work is so important, why are there distracted people who do well? To conclude this chapter, I want to address this question so it doesn’t nag at your attention as we dive deeper into the topic of depth in the pages ahead.

对于我们的探讨而言，杰克·多西的例子非常重要，因为他代表了一个我们无法忽略的群体：没有深度工作仍然取得成功的个体。本节的标题“杰克·多西是怎么回事？”其实代表了一个更广泛的问题：如果深度工作这么重要，那么为什么有些分心的人表现也很好？作为本章的总结，我希望在此解答这个问题，避免在后续章节中深入探讨深度工作问题时，你深受其扰。

To start, we must first note that Jack Dorsey is a high-level executive of a large company (two companies, in fact). Individuals with such positions play a major role in the category of those who thrive without depth, because the lifestyle of such executives is famously and unavoidably distracted. Here’s Kerry Trainor, CEO of Vimeo, trying to answer the question of how long he can go without e-mail: “I can go a good solid Saturday without, without… well, most of the daytime without it… I mean, I’ll *check it*, but I won’t necessarily respond.”

开始之前，我们首先必须认识到，杰克·多西是一家大型公司（其实是两家公司）的高管。身居如此高位之人是没有深度工作仍能成功的主要群体，因为众所周知，此类高管的生活方式不可避免地要遭遇各种干扰。Vimeo（一家视频播客网站）首席执行官克里·特雷纳（Kerry Trainor）这样说明自己可以多久不处理电子邮件：“我可以整整一个周六，不看……嗯，白天大部分时间不看……我是说，我会查看邮箱，但是不必回复。”

At the same time, of course, these executives are better compensated and more important in the American economy today than in any other time in history. Jack Dorsey’s success without depth is common at this elite level of management. Once we’ve stipulated this reality, we must then step back to remind ourselves that it doesn’t undermine the general value of depth. Why? Because the necessity of distraction in these executives’ work lives is highly specific to their particular jobs. A good chief executive is essentially a hard-to-automate decision engine, not unlike IBM’s *Jeopardy!*-playing Watson system. They have built up a hard-won repository of experience and have honed and proved an instinct for their market. They’re then presented inputs throughout the day—in the form of e-mails, meetings, site visits, and the like—that they must process and act on. To ask a CEO to spend four hours thinking deeply about a single problem is a waste of what makes him or her valuable. It’s better to hire three smart subordinates to think deeply about the problem and then bring their solutions to the executive for a final decision.

当然与此同时，这些高管也得到了很好的补偿，他们在当今美国经济中的地位比历史上任何时期都更重要。杰克·多西没有深度工作而取得成功，在其所处的精英管理层中是很常见的。明确了这一事实之后，我们必须退后一步提醒自己，这种现象并不会破坏深度工作的普遍价值。为什么？因为这些高管工作中分心的必然性是在其特定工作中特有的现象。从根本上讲，一名优秀的首席执行官就是一部难以自动化的决策引擎，与《危险边缘》游戏中 IBM 的“沃森”机器人没有太大区别。他们努力积累起丰富的经验库，打磨并证明了自己在市场中的灵敏嗅觉。而后他们全天都必须处理和解决电子邮件、会议、现场考察等纷至沓来的工作。要求一名首席执行官花上4个小时的时间深度思考单一问题浪费了他们的价值所在。最好是聘用三个聪明的副手，深度思考这些问题，然后将解决方案呈递给高管做决策。

?> 政府官员也是如此。他们不需要有非常高的智商，不需要在某方面有很出众的知识。他们更多的是需要执行的能力，人际能力，以及根据专家意见快速做出决策的能力。

This specificity is important because it tells us that if you’re a high-level executive at a major company, you probably don’t need the advice in the pages that follow. On the other hand, it also tells us that you cannot extrapolate the approach of these executives to *other* jobs. The fact that Dorsey encourages interruption or Kerry Trainor checks his e-mail constantly doesn’t mean that you’ll share their success if you follow suit: Their behaviors are characteristic of their specific roles as corporate officers.

这种特殊案例很重要，因为这种状况告诉我们，如果你是一家大型公司的高管，或许就不需要听取下述章节中的意见。另一方面，它也告诉我们不能将这些高管的工作方法外推至其他工作中。多西鼓励外界打扰，克里·特雷纳不断查阅电子邮件，虽然有这些案例，但并不意味着你学着他们的做法也能成功：他们的行为是公司领导者这个特定角色所特有的。

This rule of specificity should be applied to similar counterexamples that come to mind while reading the rest of this book. There are, we must continually remember, certain corners of our economy where depth is not valued. In addition to executives, we can also include, for example, certain types of salesmen and lobbyists, for whom constant connection is their most valued currency. There are even those who manage to grind out distracted success in fields where depth would help.

在阅读本书后续章节时，这种特别规则应该适用于其他类似的反面案例。我们必须时刻记住，在社会经济的某些角落，深度工作并没有价值。除了高管之外，还有部分类型的销售人员和说客，对他们而言持续联系是其最大价值所在。甚至还有一些人身处深度工作有所助益的领域，却在备受干扰中经过艰苦努力取得成功。

But at the same time, don’t be too hasty to label your job as necessarily non-deep. Just because your current habits make deep work difficult doesn’t mean that this lack of depth is fundamental to doing your job well. In the next chapter, for example, I tell the story of a group of high-powered management consultants who were convinced that constant e-mail connectivity was necessary for them to service their clients. When a Harvard professor forced them to disconnect more regularly (as part of a research study), they found, to their surprise, that this connectivity didn’t matter nearly as much as they had assumed. The clients didn’t really need to reach them at all times and their performance as consultants *improved* once their attention became less fractured.

与此同时，不要急于将自己的工作打上不需要深度的标签。你当前的习惯难以做到深度工作，并不意味着缺乏深度是做好工作的基础。比如，在下一章中我会讲述一群高效管理咨询师的故事，他们坚信持续的电邮联系是服务客户所必需的。当一位哈佛教授迫使他们更频繁地断开联系时，他们惊奇地发现，这种联系并没有他们想象中那么重要。客户并不需要时时联系到他们，而当精力分散减少之后，他们作为咨询师的表现反而有所提升。

Similarly, several managers I know tried to convince me that they’re most valuable when they’re able to respond quickly to their teams’ problems, preventing project logjams. They see their role as enabling others’ productivity, not necessarily protecting their own. Follow-up discussions, however, soon uncovered that this goal didn’t *really* require attention-fracturing connectivity. Indeed, many software companies now deploy the Scrum project management methodology, which replaces a lot of this ad hoc messaging with regular, highly structured, and ruthlessly efficient status meetings (often held standing up to minimize the urge to bloviate). This approach frees up more managerial time for thinking deeply about the problems their teams are tackling, often improving the overall value of what they produce.

与之类似的还有几位我认识的经理，他们想要让我信服能够迅速应对团队的问题，避免项目拖延，才是他们价值的最大体现。他们认为自己的角色是增加他人的产出，而并不一定要保持自己的产出。然而经过后续讨论，我们很快就发现这个目标并不真正需要分散精力，保持联系。事实上，如今很多软件公司都采用了 Scrum（一种迭代式增量软件开发过程，通常用于敏捷软件开发）项目管理方法，避免了很多类似的即时消息，取而代之的是更规律、高度结构化、极端高效的情况会议（通常站着进行，避免东拉西扯的情形）。这种方法释放了更多的管理时间用于深度思考团队面对的问题，从而往往能够提高整体的产出价值。

Put another way: Deep work is not the *only* skill valuable in our economy, and it’s possible to do well without fostering this ability, *but* the niches where this is advisable are increasingly rare. Unless you have strong evidence that distraction is important for your specific profession, you’re best served, for the reasons argued earlier in this chapter, by giving serious consideration to depth.

换一种说法：深度工作并非是我们的经济中唯一有价值的技能，不培养这种能力也有可能做得很好，但是不需要深度工作的职业会越来越少。除非你有充分的证据证明在你所属的职业领域分散精力是重要的，否则根据本章前述论证，若你能够认真考虑深度工作，肯定会得到最好的效果。
