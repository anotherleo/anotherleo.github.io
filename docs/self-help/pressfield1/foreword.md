# FOREWORD

<center>by Robert McKee (罗伯特·麦基)</center>

Steven Pressfield wrote *The War of Art* for me. He
undoubtedly wrote it for you too, but I know he did it expressly for me because
I hold Olympic records for procrastination. I can procrastinate thinking about my
procrastination problem. I can procrastinate dealing with my problem of
procrastinating thinking about my procrastination problem. So Pressfield, that devil,
asked me to write this foreword *against a deadline*, knowing that no matter how
much I stalled, eventually I'd have to knuckle down and do the work. At the last
possible hour I did, and as I leafed through Book One, "Defining the Enemy," I
saw myself staring back guilty-eyed from every page. But then Book Two gave me a
battle plan; Book Three, a vision of victory; and as I closed *The War of Art*, I
felt a surge of positive calm. I now know I can win this war. And if I can, so
can you.

史蒂文·普莱斯菲尔德为我写了《一生之敌》这本书。毫无疑问他也是为你写的，但我知道他是特意为我而写，因为我在拖延方面保持着奥运纪录。我可以拖延思考我的拖延问题。我可以用拖延思考我的拖延问题，来拖延解决我的拖延问题。所以普莱斯菲尔德，那个魔鬼，让我在截稿前写这篇序言。他知道无论我多么拖延，最终还是必须全力以赴。在剩下的最后一小时里，我终于照做了。当我翻看第一章时，“定义敌人”，在每一页我都看见了自己，正在用羞愧的眼神回盯着我自己。但是第二章给了我一个作战方案；第三章，胜利的愿景；当我把《一生之敌》这本书合上的时候，内心感到一阵积极的平静。现在我知道，我可以赢得这场战争。如果我可以，你也可以。

To begin Book One, Pressfield labels the enemy of creativity
Resistance, his all-encompassing term for what Freud called the Death Wish — that
destructive force inside human nature that rises whenever we consider a tough, long-term
course of action that might do for us or others something that's actually good.
He then presents a rogue's gallery of the many manifestations of Resistance. You
will recognize each and every one, for this force lives within us all — self-sabotage,
self-deception, self-corruption. We writers know it as "block," a paralysis whose
symptoms can bring on appalling behavior.

在第一章的开头，普莱斯菲尔德将创造力的敌人称为“内阻力”，这个词包含了弗洛伊德所说的一切“死亡本能”——那是暗藏在人性之中的破坏力，每当我们想做一点对自己或他人真正有益的事情，而这件事偏偏又需要艰难、长期的行动时，它就会冒出来。然后，他向我们展示了一份恶棍名单，展示内阻力的诸多表现形式。你将认出我们中的每一个人，因为这种力量存在于我们所有人的心里——自我破坏、自我欺骗和自我侵蚀。我们作家们都知道它是“阻塞”，一种瘫痪，其症状会导致骇人听闻的行为。

Some years ago I was as blocked as a Calcutta sewer, so what
did I do? I decided to try on all my clothes. To show just how anal I can get, I
put on every shirt, pair of pants, sweater, jacket, and sock, sorting them into
piles: spring, summer, fall, winter, Salvation Army. Then I tried them on all over
again, this time parsing them into spring casual, spring formal, summer casual .
. . Two days of this and I thought I was going mad. Want to know how to cure writer's
block? It's not a trip to your psychiatrist. For as Pressfield wisely points out,
seeking "support" is Resistance at its most seductive. No, the cure is found in
Book Two: "Turning Pro."

几年前，我就像加尔各答的下水道一样堵塞，怎么办呢？我决定试穿我所有的衣服。为显示自己究竟有多吹毛求疵，我穿上了每一件衬衫、裤子、毛衣、夹克和袜子，把它们分类成堆：春、夏、秋、冬，和要捐给救世军慈善组织的。然后我又把它们全都试了一遍，这次把它们分解为春季休闲、春季正式、夏季休闲……两天后我觉得自己快要疯了。想知道如何治疗作家的写作阻塞吗？不是去见你的心理医生。正如普莱斯菲尔德明智地指出的那样，寻求“支持”是内阻力最具诱惑力的表现。治疗方法在本书的第二章中可以找到：“成为职业选手”。

Steven Pressfield is the very definition of a pro. I know
this because I can't count the times I called the author of *The Legend of Bagger
Vance* to invite him for a round of golf, and although tempted, he declined. Why?
Because he was working, and as any writer who has ever taken a backswing knows,
golf is a beautifully virulent form of procrastination. In other words,
Resistance. Steve packs a discipline forged of Bethlehem steel.

史蒂文·普莱斯菲尔德就是职业选手的范本。我知道这一点，是因为我已经数不清有多少次打电话给《重返荣耀》的作者，邀请他打一局高尔夫，可无论多有吸引力，他都拒绝了。为什么？因为他在工作。也因为，任何一个曾经向后高高挥起高尔夫球杆的写作者都知道，高尔夫是披着美丽外衣的“拖延”的毒药，换言之，就是“内阻力”。史蒂夫拥有伯利恒钢铁锻造的自制力。

I read Steve's *Gates of Fire* and *Tides of War* back-to-back
while traveling in Europe. Now, I'm not a lachrymose guy; I hadn't cried over a
book since *The Red Pony*, but these novels got to me. I found myself sitting in cafés,
choking back tears over the selfless courage of those Greeks who shaped and
saved Western civilization. As I looked beneath his seamless prose and sensed his
depth of research, of knowledge of human nature and society, of vividly imagined
telling details, I was in awe of the work, the work, all the work that built the
foundation of his riveting creations. And I'm not alone in this appreciation. When
I bought the books in London, I was told that Steve's novels are now assigned by
Oxford history dons who tell their students that if they wish to rub shoulders with
life in classical Greece, read Pressfield.

在欧洲旅行时，我一口气读完了史蒂文的《火之门》和《战争浪潮》。现在我不是一个爱哭的人。从《小红马》之后就没有因为一本书哭过，但是那些小说真正触动了我。我发现自己坐在咖啡馆里，为那些塑造和拯救了西方文明的希腊人的无私勇气而强忍着泪水。当我看着他流畅的行文，感知到他研究的深度，对人性和社会的了解，以及生动想象的细节时，我对这项工作感到敬畏——这项工作，所有为他引人入胜的创作奠定基础的工作。我并不是唯一一个这样欣赏他的人。当我在伦敦买这些书时，他们告诉我，史蒂文的小说现在被牛津历史学老师们列为指定书目，并且告诉他们的学生们，如果想与古希腊人交往，读普莱斯菲尔德。

How does an artist achieve that power? In the second book
Pressfield lays out the day-by-day, step-by-step campaign of the professional: preparation,
order, patience, endurance, acting in the face of fear and failure — no excuses,
no bullshit. And best of all, Steve's brilliant insight that first, last, and
always, the professional focuses on mastery of the craft.

一个艺术家是如何获得那种力量的？在第二章中，普莱斯菲尔德讲述了专业的人日复一日、循序渐进的战役：准备、秩序、耐心、耐力，面对恐惧和失败采取行动——没有借口，没有废话。最棒的是，史蒂文一针见血地指出，职业选手首先、最后、并且永远专注于精通技艺。

Book Three, "The Higher Realm," looks at Inspiration, that
sublime result that blossoms in the furrows of the professional who straps on
the harness and plows the fields of his or her art. In Pressfield's words: "When
we sit down each day and do our work, power concentrates around us . . . we become
like a magnetized rod that attracts iron filings. Ideas come. Insights accrete."
On this, the *effect* of Inspiration, Steve and I absolutely agree. Indeed, stunning
images and ideas arrive as if from nowhere. In fact, these seemingly spontaneous
flashes are so amazing, it's hard to believe that our unworthy selves created them.
From where, therefore, does our best stuff come?

第三章，“更高的领域”，着眼于灵感。灵感是非凡的成果，在那些职业选手的犁沟里绽放，他们系上挽具，在自己的艺术领域细细耕耘。用普莱斯菲尔德的话来说：“当我们每天坐下来工作时，力量集聚在我们周围……我们变得像一块吸引铁屑的磁铁。想法来了。洞察涌现。”在这一点上，关于灵感的效应，史蒂文和我意见完全一致。确实，那些令人惊叹的图像和想法不知从何而来。事实上，这些看似自发的灵光一现是如此惊人，很难相信是我们那根本不配的自己创造了它们。所以，我们最好的东西到底是从哪里来的？

It's on this point, however, the *cause* of Inspiration, that we
see things differently. In Book One Steve traces Resistance down its evolutionary
roots to the genes. I agree. The cause is genetic. That negative force, that dark
antagonism to creativity, is embedded deep in our humanity. But in Book Three he
shifts gears and looks for the cause of Inspiration not in human nature, but on
a "higher realm." Then with a poetic fire he lays out his belief in muses and angels.
The ultimate source of creativity, he argues, is divine. Many, perhaps most readers,
will find Book Three profoundly moving.

然而，正是在这一点上，我们对灵感的来源看法不同。在第一章中，史蒂文将内阻力的进化根源追溯到了基因。我同意。原因是遗传的。那种消极的力量，与创造力的黑暗对抗，深深地被嵌在我们的人性之中。但在第三章中，他调转了方向，寻找灵感的来源——不是人性，而是“更高的领域”。然后，他用诗意的火焰表达了他对缪斯和天使的相信。他认为，创造力的最终来源，是神圣的。许多人，也许是大多数读者，会发现第三章格外动人。

I, on the other hand, believe that the source of creativity is
found on the same plane of reality as Resistance. It, too, is genetic. It's called
talent: the innate power to discover the hidden connection between two things —
images, ideas, words — that no one else has ever seen before, link them, and create
for the world a third, utterly unique work. Like our IQ, talent is a gift from our
ancestors. If we're lucky, we inherit it. In the fortunate talented few, the dark
dimension of their natures will first resist the labor that creativity demands,
but once they commit to the task, their talented side stirs to action and
rewards them with astonishing feats. These flashes of creative genius seem to arrive
from out of the blue for the obvious reason: They come from the unconscious mind.
In short, if the Muse exists, she does not whisper to the untalented.

而我，在另一方面，相信创造力的来源与内阻力是在同一个实相层面找到的。它也与遗传基因有关。它被叫作天赋：一种与生俱来的能力，能够发现两件事之间隐藏的联系——其他人从未见过的图像、想法和文字，将它们联系起来，并为世界创造第三部全然独特的作品。和智商一样，天赋也是祖先赠予我们的礼物。如果幸运，我们就能继承它。而对极少数幸运的天才来说，人性中阴暗的一面会先跳出来，阻碍他们从事创造力所需要的劳动，然而一旦他们投入到命定的工作中，天赋的一面就会被激发起来，并以惊人的成果回馈他们。这些创造性天才的灵光一现似乎是突如其来的，原因很明显：它们来自潜意识的大脑。简言之，如果缪斯存在，她不会对没有天赋的人窃窃私语。

So although Steve and I may differ on the cause, we agree on
the effect: When inspiration touches talent, she gives birth to truth and beauty.
And when Steven Pressfield was writing *The War of Art*, she had her hands all over
him.

因此，尽管史蒂文和我可能在原因上持不同意见，但在结果上是一致的：当灵感触碰才华，她会孕育出真理和美。当史蒂文·普莱斯菲尔德在写这本《一生之敌》时，她的手抓住了他。
