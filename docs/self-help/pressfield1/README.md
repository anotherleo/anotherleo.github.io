# The War of Art

## WHAT I DO

I get up, take a shower, have breakfast. I read the paper, brush my teeth. If I have phone calls to make, I make them. I've got my coffee now. I put on my lucky work boots and stitch up the lucky laces that my niece Meredith gave me. I head back to my office, crank up the computer. My lucky hooded sweatshirt is draped over the chair, with the lucky charm I got from a gypsy in Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer for only eight bucks in francs, and my lucky LARGO name tag that came from a dream I once had. I put it on. On my thesaurus is my lucky cannon that my friend Bob Versandi gave me from Morro Castle, Cuba. I point it toward my chair, so it can fire inspiration into me. I say my prayer, which is the Invocation of the Muse from Homer's *Odyssey*, translation by T. E. Lawrence, Lawrence of Arabia, which my dear mate Paul Rink gave me and which sits near my shelf with the cuff links that belonged to my father and my lucky acorn from the battlefield at Thermopylae. It's about ten-thirty now. I sit down and plunge in. When I start making typos, I know I'm getting tired. That's four hours or so. I've hit the point of diminishing returns. I wrap for the day. Copy whatever I've done to disk and stash the disk in the glove compartment of my truck in case there's a fire and I have to run for it. I power down. It's three, three-thirty. The office is closed. How many pages have I produced? I don't care. Are they any good? I don't even think about it. All that matters is I've put in my time and hit it with all I've got. All that counts is that, for this day, for this session, I have overcome Resistance.

我起床，洗澡，吃早饭。我读报纸，刷牙。如果有电话要打，就打电话。我已经拿到了我的咖啡。我穿上我的幸运工作靴，系上侄女梅雷迪斯给我的幸运鞋带，启动电脑。我的幸运连帽运动衫搭在椅背上，上面有我从滨海圣玛丽一个吉卜赛人那里得到的幸运符，只花了八法郎。那是我的好运名牌“拉戈”，出自我曾经做过的一个梦。我的分类词典上放着朋友鲍勃·范兰迪从古巴摩洛古堡带回来给我的幸运机关炮。我把它对准我的椅子，好对我发射灵感。我说出我的祷文，是《荷马史诗·奥德赛》里对缪斯的召唤，由T. E.劳伦斯翻译，他也被叫作阿拉伯的劳伦斯。这是来自我亲爱的朋友保罗·林克的礼物，它端坐在我的书架旁，和我父亲的手环，还有我从希腊塞莫皮莱战场带回来的幸运橡果在一起。现在大概十点半。我坐下来投入写作中。当我开始打错字的时候，我知道我已经累了。大概四个小时过去了。我已经开始进入递减的状态。我结束一天的工作。不管写了什么，都备份到磁盘上，然后把磁盘塞进我的卡车内置的手套箱里，以免办公室着火，而我需要冲进火里把它救出来。我关掉电源。此刻三点三十分。办公室关闭。我写了多少页？我不在乎。写得好吗？我连想都不去想。唯一重要的是，我已经投入了我的时间，用尽了我有的一切。唯一重要的是，在这一天，这一段时间里，我克服了内阻力。

## WHAT I KNOW

There's a secret that real writers know that wannabe writers don't, and the secret is this: It's not the writing part that's hard. What's hard is sitting down to write.

有一个秘密，真正的作家知道，想成为作家的人不知道。这个秘密就是：难的并不是写作。而是坐下来开始写。

What keeps us from sitting down is Resistance.

阻止我们坐下来的，是内阻力。

## THE UNLIVED LIFE

Most of us have two lives. The life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands Resistance.

我们中的大多数人都有两个人生。我们正在活的，和从来没有活过的。在两个人生之间的，就是内阻力。

Have you ever brought home a treadmill and let it gather dust in the attic? Ever quit a diet, a course of yoga, a meditation practice? Have you ever bailed out on a call to embark upon a spiritual practice, dedicate yourself to a humanitarian calling, commit your life to the service of others? Have you ever wanted to be a mother, a doctor, an advocate for the weak and helpless; to run for office, crusade for the planet, campaign for world peace, or to preserve the environment? Late at night have you experienced a vision of the person you might become, the work you could accomplish, the realized being you were meant to be? Are you a writer who doesn't write, a painter who doesn't paint, an entrepreneur who never starts a venture? Then you know what Resistance is.

你是否买过跑步机却把它丢在阁楼上落灰？尝试过节食、瑜伽课程、冥想练习？曾经受到修炼性灵、献身人道主义使命、以毕生精力奉献他人之类的感召却怠惰不曾行动？想过要当一个母亲、一名医生、一个为弱小无助者发声的人；想要竞选公职，为这颗星球而不懈奋斗，为世界和平或保护环境而战？夜深的时候你有没有试着去想过那个你可能成为的人，可以完成的工作，本来应该成为的人。你是不是那个不写作的作家，不画画的画家，从来没有办过一家企业的企业家？现在，你知道什么是内阻力了吧。

Resistance is the most toxic force on the planet. It is the root of more unhappiness than poverty, disease, and erectile dysfunction. To yield to Resistance deforms our spirit. It stunts us and makes us less than we are and were born to be. If you believe in God (and I do) you must declare Resistance evil, for it prevents us from achieving the life God intended when He endowed each of us with our own unique genius. *Genius* is a Latin word; the Romans used it to denote an inner spirit, holy and inviolable, which watches over us, guiding us to our calling. A writer writes with his genius; an artist paints with hers; everyone who creates operates from this sacramental center. It is our soul's seat, the vessel that holds our being-in-potential, our star's beacon and Polaris.

内阻力是这个星球上最有毒的一股力量。比起贫穷、疾病和勃起功能障碍，它才是我们不幸福的根源。屈服于内阻力会使我们的心灵变形。它阻碍我们的成长，使我们无法成为我们本来就是或生来应该是的那个人。如果你相信上天（我相信），你就必须大声宣告，内阻力是邪恶的。因为它阻止我们活出上天原本安排我们活出的人生——用我们每个人被赋予的独一无二的天赋。“天赋”是个拉丁词，罗马人用它来表示一种内在的精神，神圣，不可侵犯。它守护着我们，引导我们接收各自使命的召唤。作家用他的天赋写作，画家用他的天赋画画，每个创作者都跟从这个神圣的核心而行动。它是我们灵魂的位座。承载我们生命潜能的容器，我们的星之灯塔和北极星。

Every sun casts a shadow, and genius's shadow is Resistance. As powerful as is our soul's call to realization, so potent are the forces of Resistance arrayed against it. Resistance is faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, harder to kick than crack cocaine. We're not alone if we've been mowed down by Resistance; millions of good men and women have bitten the dust before us. And here's the biggest bitch: We don't even know what hit us. I never did. From age twenty-four to thirty-two, Resistance kicked my ass from East Coast to West and back again thirteen times and I never even knew it existed. I looked everywhere for the enemy and failed to see it right in front of my face.

每个太阳都投下阴影，天才的阴影就是内阻力。与我们的灵魂对自我实现的感召一样强大，阻碍自我实现的内阻力也如此强大。内阻力比高速子弹更快，比火车头更强大，比可卡因更难戒除。如果你被内阻力击倒，你并不孤单。成千上万的男人、女人曾在我们之前倒下死去。而最让人崩溃的是：我们甚至不知道是什么打倒了我们。我一直都不知道。从二十四岁到三十二岁，内阻力把我从东海岸到西海岸来回踢了十三次，而我从来不知道它的存在。我四处寻找敌人，却看不到就在我眼前的它。

Have you heard this story: Woman learns she has cancer, six months to live. Within days she quits her job, resumes the dream of writing Tex-Mex songs she gave up to raise a family (or starts studying classical Greek, or moves to the inner city and devotes herself to tending babies with AIDS). Woman's friends think she's crazy; she herself has never been happier. There's a postscript. Woman's cancer goes into remission.

你听说过这个故事吗：女人得知自己得了癌症，还有六个月的生命。几天之内，她辞掉了工作，重新开始创作得州-墨西哥风格的歌曲，那是她为了养家糊口而放弃的梦想（或是开始学习古希腊语，或是搬到旧城区并把自己奉献给照顾艾滋病婴儿的工作）。女人的朋友们认为她疯了；她自己却从未如此快乐过。附言就是，女人的癌症缓和了。

Is that what it takes? Do we have to stare death in the face to make us stand up and confront Resistance? Does Resistance have to cripple and disfigure our lives before we wake up to its existence? How many of us have become drunks and drug addicts, developed tumors and neuroses, succumbed to painkillers, gossip, and compulsive cell-phone use, simply because we don't do that thing that our hearts, our inner genius, is calling us to? Resistance defeats us. If tomorrow morning by some stroke of magic every dazed and benighted soul woke up with the power to take the first step toward pursuing his or her dreams, every shrink in the directory would be out of business. Prisons would stand empty. The alcohol and tobacco industries would collapse, along with the junk food, cosmetic surgery, and infotainment businesses, not to mention pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and the medical profession from top to bottom. Domestic abuse would become extinct, as would addiction, obesity, migraine headaches, road rage, and dandruff.

一定要付出这样的代价吗？我们一定要等到死亡迫近眼前才能站起来对抗内阻力吗？一定要等到生命残缺不全、面目全非，我们才能惊醒，意识到它的存在吗？有多少人变成了酒鬼和瘾君子，患上了肿瘤和神经衰弱，屈服于止痛药、流言蜚语和手机成瘾，仅仅是因为我们没有做那件我们的心和我们的内在天赋召唤我们去做的事情？内阻力打败了我们。如果明天早上醒来，有什么魔法可以击中这些陷入迷茫和黑夜的灵魂，让他们醒过来，拥有力量迈出追求梦想的第一步，那么所有在册心理医生都会失业。监狱将空无一人。烟酒行业、垃圾食品业、整容机构、信息娱乐行业，更别提制药公司、医院和整个医疗行业了。家庭暴力将消失，成瘾症、肥胖、偏头痛、路怒症和头皮屑也会消失。

Look in your own heart. Unless I'm crazy, right now a still, small voice is piping up, telling you as it has ten thousand times before, the calling that is yours and yours alone. You know it. No one has to tell you. And unless I'm crazy, you're no closer to taking action on it than you were yesterday or will be tomorrow. You think Resistance isn't real? Resistance will bury you.

看看你自己的内心。除非我疯了，就在此刻，一个静止、微弱的声音正在传来，像以前一万次告诉过你的一样，这个召唤是你的，并且是你要独自完成的。你知道的。没有人需要告诉你。除非我疯了，否则你不会比昨天或者明天更有可能采取行动。你认为内阻力是逗你玩的吗？内阻力会埋葬你。

You know, Hitler wanted to be an artist. At eighteen he took his inheritance, seven hundred kronen, and moved to Vienna to live and study. He applied to the Academy of Fine Arts and later to the School of Architecture. Ever see one of his paintings? Neither have I. Resistance beat him. Call it overstatement but I'll say it anyway: it was easier for Hitler to start World War II than it was for him to face a blank square of canvas.

要知道，希特勒也曾梦想成为一名艺术家。十八岁时，他带着继承的七百克朗遗产搬到维也纳生活、学习。他报考美术学院，后来又报考了建筑学院。可你见过他的哪怕一幅画吗？我也没有。内阻力击败了他。你可以说这是夸大其词，但我还是要说：对于希特勒来说，面对一块空白画布，比发动第二次世界大战还要难。
