# RESISTANCE: Defining the Enemy

The enemy is a very good teacher.

— the Dalai Lama

## RESISTANCE'S GREATEST HITS

The following is a list, in no particular order, of those activities that most commonly elicit Resistance:

下面是一张列表，是那些最常引发内阻力的行为，排名不分先后：

1)   The pursuit of any calling in writing, painting, music, film, dance, or any creative art, however marginal or unconventional. ① 响应任何有关写作、绘画、音乐、电影、舞蹈或任何创造性艺术方面的召唤，无论多么边缘或多么传统。

2)   The launching of any entrepreneurial venture or enterprise, for profit or otherwise. ② 创业，无论企业还是事业，无论是为了盈利还是其他。

3)   Any diet or health regimen. ③ 任何节食或健康饮食方案。

4)   Any program of spiritual advancement. ④ 任何有关灵性成长的计划。

5)   Any activity whose aim is tighter abdominals. ⑤ 任何以收紧腹部为目标的活动。

6)   Any course or program designed to overcome an unwholesome habit or addiction. ⑥ 任何旨在改变痼习和痼癖的课程或计划。

7)   Education of every kind. ⑦ 每一种教育。

8)   Any act of political, moral, or ethical courage, including the decision to change for the better some unworthy pattern of thought or conduct in ourselves. ⑧ 任何政治、道德或伦理勇气的行为，包括决心改善我们自身某些不足取的思维或行为模式。

9)   The undertaking of any enterprise or endeavor whose aim is to help others. ⑨ 任何以帮助他人为目标的事业或努力。

10)   Any act that entails commitment of the heart. The decision to get married, to have a child, to weather a rocky patch in a relationship. ⑩ 任何需要用心承诺的行为。决定结婚，决定生孩子，决定经营一段可能历经坎坷的感情。

11)   The taking of any principled stand in the face of adversity. ⑪ 身处逆境却依然坚守原则与立场。

In other words, any act that rejects immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity. Or, expressed another way, any act that derives from our higher nature instead of our lower. Any of these will elicit Resistance.

换句话说，任何为了长远发展、健康或坚持正直而拒绝即时满足的行为。或者换一种说法，任何源于我们的更高本性而不是低级本性的行为。其中的任何一个都会引发内阻力。

Now: what are the characteristics of Resistance?

那么，内阻力的特点是什么？

## RESISTANCE IS INVISIBLE

Resistance cannot be seen, touched, heard, or smelled. But it can be felt. We experience it as an energy field radiating from a work-in-potential. It's a repelling force. It's negative. Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, prevent us from doing our work.

内阻力看不见、摸不着、听不见、闻不到。但它可以被感觉到。每当我们准备开始工作，这项工作便会辐射出一个能量场，让我们感受到它的存在。它是一种排斥力，是负面的。它的目的是把我们推开，分散我们的注意力，阻止我们投入工作。

## RESISTANCE IS INTERNAL

Resistance seems to come from outside ourselves. We locate it in spouses, jobs, bosses, kids. "Peripheral opponents," as Pat Riley used to say when he coached the Los Angeles Lakers.

内阻力看似来自我们自身之外。我们常常将它归咎于配偶、工作、老板、孩子。正如帕特·莱利执教洛杉矶湖人队时常说的，“外围对手”。

Resistance is not a peripheral opponent. Resistance arises from within. It is self-generated and self-perpetuated. Resistance is the enemy within.

内阻力不是外围对手。内阻力来自内部，它是自我生发和自我延续的。内阻力是内在的敌人。

## RESISTANCE IS INSIDIOUS

Resistance will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work. It will perjure, fabricate, falsify; seduce, bully, cajole. Resistance is protean. It will assume any form, if that's what it takes to deceive you. It will reason with you like a lawyer or jam a nine-millimeter in your face like a stickup man. Resistance has no conscience. It will pledge anything to get a deal, then double-cross you as soon as your back is turned. If you take Resistance at its word, you deserve everything you get. Resistance is always lying and always full of shit.

只要能阻止你工作，内阻力什么话都会说。它会作伪证、捏造、篡改；勾引、恐吓、哄骗。内阻力千变万化。只要能骗到你，它可以幻化成任何面貌出现。像律师一样说服你，或是像劫匪一样，举起九毫米口径的手枪对准你的脸。内阻力没有良知。它会不惜一切来达成交易，可只要一转身，它就立刻出卖你。如果相信了内阻力，那就活该变成你现在的样子。内阻力总是在撒谎，总是在胡说八道。

## RESISTANCE IS IMPLACABLE

Resistance is like the Alien or the Terminator or the shark in *Jaws*. It cannot be reasoned with. It understands nothing but power. It is an engine of destruction, programmed from the factory with one object only: to prevent us from doing our work. Resistance is implacable, intractable, indefatigable. Reduce it to a single cell and that cell will continue to attack.

内阻力就像是“异形”“终结者”，或是《大白鲨》里的那条鲨鱼。它不讲道理。除了力量，它一无所知。它是一个破坏引擎，从出厂起就被设定了唯一的目标：阻止我们工作。内阻力是不依不饶的，它顽固、不知疲倦。哪怕把它简化成一个单细胞，这个单细胞依然会继续攻击。

This is Resistance's nature. It's all it knows.

这是内阻力的天性。它只懂得这一件事。

## RESISTANCE IS IMPERSONAL

Resistance is not out to get you personally. It doesn't know who you are and doesn't care. Resistance is a force of nature. It acts objectively.

内阻力并不只针对你一个人。它不知道你是谁，也不在乎。内阻力是一种自然的力量。它客观地行事。

Though it feels malevolent, Resistance in fact operates with the indifference of rain and transits the heavens by the same laws as the stars. When we marshal our forces to combat Resistance, we must remember this.

虽然让人感觉满怀恶意，但实际上，内阻力的运作就像雨一样冷漠，遵循着与星星一样的规则，穿过天空。在集结力量抗击内阻力时，我们必须牢记这一点。

## RESISTANCE IS INFALLIBLE

Like a magnetized needle floating on a surface of oil, Resistance will unfailingly point to true North — meaning that calling or action it most wants to stop us from doing.

就像漂浮在油面上的磁针，内阻力总会不偏不倚地指向正北方——那里有它最想阻止我们回应的召唤或采取的行动。

We can use this. We can use it as a compass. We can navigate by Resistance, letting it guide us to that calling or action that we must follow before all others.

我们可以利用这一点，把它当作指南针。我们可以用内阻力来导航，借助它来分辨我们必须首先响应的召唤、采取的行动。

Rule of thumb: The more important a call or action is to our soul's evolution, the more Resistance we will feel toward pursuing it.

经验法则：对于我们灵魂进化，越是重要的召唤或行动，追求它时遭遇的内阻力就越大。

## RESISTANCE IS UNIVERSAL

We're wrong if we think we're the only ones struggling with Resistance. Everyone who has a body experiences Resistance.

如果认为我们是唯一与内阻力抗争的人，那就错了。每个有身体的人都在体验着内阻力。

## RESISTANCE NEVER SLEEPS

Henry Fonda was still throwing up before each stage performance, even when he was seventy-five. In other words, fear doesn't go away. The warrior and the artist live by the same code of necessity, which dictates that the battle must be fought anew every day.

即便到了七十五岁，亨利·方达每次登台演出前依然会紧张到呕吐。换言之，恐惧不会消失。战士和艺术家们生活在相同的必然法则中，那就是，这场战争必定每天重来一次。

## RESISTANCE PLAYS FOR KEEPS

Resistance's goal is not to wound or disable. Resistance aims to kill. Its target is the epicenter of our being: our genius, our soul, the unique and priceless gift we were put on earth to give and that no one else has but us. Resistance means business. When we fight it, we are in a war to the death.

内阻力的目标不是伤害或致残。它瞄准的是杀戮。它的目标是我们存在的核心：我们的天才，我们的灵魂，我们被投放在这地球上时被赋予的独特而无价的天赋——除了我们之外，没有其他人拥有。内阻力不会开玩笑。一旦开始与之抗争，我们就陷身于一场至死方休的战争里了。

## RESISTANCE IS FUELED BY FEAR

Resistance has no strength of its own. Every ounce of juice it possesses comes from us. We feed it with power by our fear of it. Master that fear and we conquer Resistance.

内阻力本身并没有力量。它拥有的每一盎司营养都来自我们自身。我们用对它的恐惧来喂养它，让它获得力量。控制恐惧，我们就能战胜内阻力。

## RESISTANCE ONLY OPPOSES IN ONE DIRECTION

Resistance obstructs movement only from a lower sphere to a higher. It kicks in when we seek to pursue a calling in the arts, launch an innovative enterprise, or evolve to a higher station morally, ethically, or spiritually.

内阻力只阻碍我们从低领域向高领域的运动。当我们在艺术领域追求某种使命时，或是推出一家创新型企业，或是试图在道德、伦理或灵魂方面向更高的层面提升时，它会开始起作用。

So if you're in Calcutta working with the Mother Teresa Foundation and you're thinking of bolting to launch a career in telemarketing. . . relax. Resistance will give you a free pass.

因此，如果你本来在加尔各答与特蕾莎修女基金会合作，现在正考虑转行加入电话营销行业。尽管放心。内阻力会给你一个畅通无阻的通行证。

## RESISTANCE IS MOST POWERFUL AT THE FINISH LINE

Odysseus almost got home years before his actual homecoming. Ithaca was in sight, close enough that the sailors could see the smoke of their families' fires on shore. Odysseus was so certain he was safe, he actually lay down for a snooze. It was then that his men, believing there was gold in an ox-hide sack among their commander's possessions, snatched this prize and cut it open. The bag contained the adverse Winds, which King Aeolus had bottled up for Odysseus when the wanderer had touched earlier at his blessed isle. The winds burst forth now in one mad blow, driving Odysseus' ships back across every league of ocean they had with such difficulty traversed, making him endure further trials and sufferings before, at last and alone, he reached home for good.

奥德赛原本早几年就可以回家了的，就差那么一点儿。伊萨卡已近在眼前，近到水手们都可以看到岸上家里的炊烟。奥德赛太笃定，他确信一切都安全了，于是躺下来打了个盹。可就一瞬的松懈，让手下偷走了这份来自风神王的礼物。手下一直认为船长的这个牛皮口袋里藏着金子。可袋子里装的是逆风。是奥德赛早些时候到达那座神圣的小岛时，风神王为这位流浪者封装进去的。袋子被割开，狂风呼啸，吹得奥德赛的船倒退着重新穿过了他们艰难穿越的每一海里的洋面，让他不得不经受更多的考验和痛苦，直到最后，才孤身一人回到家中。

The danger is greatest when the finish line is in sight. At this point, Resistance knows we're about to beat it. It hits the panic button. It marshals one last assault and slams us with everything it's got.

当终点线在望时危险最大。到了那一刻，内阻力知道我们即将击败它。它按下了紧急按钮。组织了最后一次攻击，用它所拥有的一切猛击我们。

The professional must be alert for this counterattack. Be wary at the end. Don't open that bag of wind.

职业选手必须警惕这次反击。在最后一刻要小心，别打开那袋风。

## RESISTANCE RECRUITS ALLIES

Resistance by definition is self-sabotage. But there's a parallel peril that must also be guarded against: sabotage by others.

内阻力的定义就是自我破坏。但是，还有一个平行的危险也必须加以防范：来自他人的破坏。

When a writer begins to overcome her Resistance — in other words, when she actually starts to write — she may find that those close to her begin acting strange. They may become moody or sullen, they may get sick; they may accuse the awakening writer of "changing," of "not being the person she was." The closer these people are to the awakening writer, the more bizarrely they will act and the more emotion they will put behind their actions.

当一名作家开始克服她的内阻力时，换句话说，当她真正开始写作时，她可能会发现那些周围亲近的人开始表现得奇怪。他们可能会变得喜怒无常、闷闷不乐，也可能会生病；他们可能会指责觉醒的作家“变了”“不是她原来的样子了”。这些人离觉醒的作家越近，他们的行为就越奇怪，他们在行为背后隐藏的情绪也就越多。

They are trying to sabotage her.

他们试图阻碍她。

The reason is that they are struggling, consciously or unconsciously, against their own Resistance. The awakening writer's success becomes a reproach to them. If she can beat these demons, why can't they?

原因是他们正在有意识或无意识地对抗自己的内阻力。觉醒作家的成功会成为对他们的一种责备。如果她能打败这些恶魔，为什么他们不能？

Often couples or close friends, even entire families, will enter into tacit compacts whereby each individual pledges (unconsciously) to remain mired in the same slough in which she and all her cronies have become so comfortable. The highest treason a crab can commit is to make a leap for the rim of the bucket.

通常，夫妻或亲密的朋友，甚至整个家庭，都会进入一种心照不宣的协议模式，每个人都会（不知不觉地）尽力确保自己和所有亲朋好友困在同一个坑里，他和他所有的亲友就那样躺在坑里，无比舒适。一只螃蟹所能犯下的最严重的叛国罪，就是跳上桶口的边缘。

The awakening artist must be ruthless, not only with herself but with others. Once you make your break, you can't turn around for your buddy who catches his trouser leg on the barbed wire. The best thing you can do for that friend (and he'd tell you this himself, if he really is your friend) is to get over the wall and keep motating.

觉醒的艺术家必须是无情的，不仅是对自己，也对其他人。一旦成功突围，你就不能再回头去找你的朋友，哪怕带刺的铁丝网挂住了他的裤腿。你能为那个朋友做的最好的事（如果他是个真正的朋友，也会这么对你说），就是翻过墙去，继续朝前走。

The best and only thing that one artist can do for another is to serve as an example and an inspiration.

一位艺术家能够为其他艺术家做的最好的，也是唯一的事情，就是成为榜样和灵感。

Now, let's consider the next aspect of Resistance: symptoms.

现在，让我们来看看内阻力的下一个侧面：症状。

## RESISTANCE AND PROCRASTINATION

Procrastination is the most common manifestation of Resistance because it's the easiest to rationalize. We don't tell ourselves, "I'm never going to write my symphony." Instead we say, "I am going to write my symphony; I'm just going to start tomorrow."

拖延是内阻力最常见的表现，因为它最容易被合理化。我们不会坦然承认，“我永远不会动笔去写我的交响乐。”相反，我们会说：“我会写的——只是明天再开始。”

## RESISTANCE AND PROCRASTINATION, PART TWO

The most pernicious aspect of procrastination is that it can become a habit. We don't just put off our lives today; we put them off till our deathbed.

拖延最大的害处是，它可能成为一种习惯。我们不只是今天拖延生命——我们可以一直拖延到死。

Never forget: This very moment, we can change our lives. There never was a moment, and never will be, when we are without the power to alter our destiny. This second, we can turn the tables on Resistance.

永远不要忘记：就在这一刻，我们可以改变我们的生活。从来没有哪个时刻，也永远不会有那么一刻，让我们不具备改写命运的力量。这一秒，我们可以在内阻力面前反败为胜。

This second, we can sit down and do our work.

这一秒，我们可以坐下来，开始我们的工作。

## RESISTANCE AND SEX

Sometimes Resistance takes the form of sex, or an obsessive preoccupation with sex. Why sex? Because sex provides immediate and powerful gratification. When someone sleeps with us, we feel validated and approved of, even loved. Resistance gets a big kick out of that. It knows it has distracted us with a cheap, easy fix and kept us from doing our work.

有时，内阻力会以性或沉迷于性的形式出现。为什么是性？因为性能提供即时而有力的满足。当有人和我们一起睡觉时，我们感到被认可，被确认，甚至被爱。内阻力从中得到很大的乐趣。它知道，它成功地用一种简单廉价的方法分散了我们的注意力，让我们无法完成工作。

Of course not all sex is a manifestation of Resistance. In my experience, you can tell by the measure of hollowness you feel afterward. The more empty you feel, the more certain you can be that your true motivation was not love or even lust but Resistance.

当然，并非所有的性都是内阻力的表现。根据我的经验，可以通过事后空虚的程度来判断。你越感到空虚，就越能确定你真正的动机不是爱，甚至不是欲望，而是内阻力。

It goes without saying that this principle applies to drugs, shopping, masturbation, TV, gossip, alcohol, and the consumption of all products containing fat, sugar, salt, or chocolate.

毫无疑问，这一原则也适用于判断嗜药、购物、自慰、电视、八卦、酒精，以及所有含有脂肪、糖、盐或巧克力的食品的消耗。

## RESISTANCE AND TROUBLE

We get ourselves in trouble because it's a cheap way to get attention. Trouble is a faux form of fame. It's easier to get busted in the bedroom with the faculty chairman's wife than it is to finish that dissertation on the metaphysics of motley in the novellas of Joseph Conrad.

我们让自己陷入麻烦，因为它是一种能够吸引注意力的廉价方式。麻烦是一种虚假的名声。相较于完成一篇探讨约瑟夫·康拉德中篇小说中“杂色的形而上学”的论文，跟系主席的妻子开房显然更容易吸引关注。

Ill health is a form of trouble, as are alcoholism and drug addiction, proneness to accidents, all neurosis including compulsive screwing-up, and such seemingly benign foibles as jealousy, chronic lateness, and the blasting of rap music at 110 dB from your smoked-glass '95 Supra. Anything that draws attention to ourselves through pain-free or artificial means is a manifestation of Resistance.

生病是制造麻烦的一种形式，酒瘾和药瘾也是，发生事故的倾向，包括强迫性搞砸一切在内的所有神经病症，乃至一些看似无害的小缺点，比如嫉妒、习惯性迟到，在烟雾缭绕的九五年版丰田萨普拉跑车里以110分贝的音量播放说唱音乐……统统都是。任何通过无痛苦或人为手段吸引注意力的行为都是内阻力的表现。

Cruelty to others is a form of Resistance, as is the willing endurance of cruelty from others. 

对他人残忍也是内阻力的一种表现形式，同样，甘愿忍受他人的残忍也是。

The working artist will not tolerate trouble in her life because she knows trouble prevents her from doing her work. The working artist banishes from her world all sources of trouble. She harnesses the urge for trouble and transforms it in her work.

职业艺术家不会容忍生活中的麻烦，因为她知道，麻烦会阻碍她的工作。职业艺术家把所有麻烦的源头都从她的世界中驱逐出去。她控制自己对麻烦的渴望，并将它们转化为作品。

## RESISTANCE AND SELF-DRAMATIZATION

Creating soap opera in our lives is a symptom of Resistance. Why put in years of work designing a new software interface when you can get just as much attention by bringing home a boyfriend with a prison record?

在生活中演绎肥皂剧是内阻力的症状。既然只要带一个有入狱记录的男朋友回家就能获得同样的关注，为什么还要花上几年时间设计一个新的软件界面呢？

Sometimes entire families participate unconsciously in a culture of self-dramatization. The kids fuel the tanks, the grown-ups arm the phasers, the whole starship lurches from one spine-tingling episode to another. And the crew knows how to keep it going. If the level of drama drops below a certain threshold, someone jumps in to amp it up. Dad gets drunk, Mom gets sick, Janie shows up for church with an Oakland Raiders tattoo. It's more fun than a movie. And it works: Nobody gets a damn thing done.

有时，整个家庭都不自觉地参与到自我戏剧化的氛围培养中。孩子们给坦克加满油，大人们武装上光炮，整艘星际飞船跌跌撞撞，从一个让人毛骨悚然的情节跳到另一个。全体船员都知道如何才能让这一切继续。如果戏剧化水平下降到某个阈值以下，就会有人跳进去，放大它。爸爸喝醉了，妈妈生病了，珍妮带着奥克兰突袭者的文身出现在教堂。这比电影还有趣。而且很有效——谁都别想完成哪怕一件事。

Sometimes I think of Resistance as a sort of evil twin to Santa Claus, who makes his rounds house-to-house, making sure that everything's taken care of. When he comes to a house that's hooked on self-dramatization, his ruddy cheeks glow and he giddy-ups away behind his eight tiny reindeer. He knows there'll be no work done in that house.

有时我会把内阻力看作是圣诞老人的邪恶双胞胎。他挨家挨户巡视，确保一切尽在掌握。当来到一户沉迷于自我戏剧化的人家门外，他红润的脸颊容光焕发，放心地驾着八只小驯鹿拉的雪橇车转身离开。他知道，在这座房子里，不会有任何工作能完成。

## RESISTANCE AND SELF-MEDICATION

Do you regularly ingest any substance, controlled or otherwise, whose aim is the alleviation of depression, anxiety, etc.? I offer the following experience:

你是否经常服用任一缓解抑郁、焦虑之类症状的药物，无论是管制药物还是其他？我想提供以下经验：

I once worked as a writer for a big New York ad agency. Our boss used to tell us: Invent a disease. Come up with the disease, he said, and we can sell the cure.

我曾在纽约一家大型广告公司担任文案。那时，老板常常对我们说：去发明一种疾病。他说，只要造出个病来，我们就可以卖药了。

Attention Deficit Disorder, Seasonal Affect Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder. These aren't diseases, they're marketing ploys. Doctors didn't discover them, copywriters did. Marketing departments did. Drug companies did.

注意力缺陷障碍，季节性情感障碍，社交焦虑障碍。这些不是疾病，而是营销策略。医生没有发现它们，文案却发现了。营销部门发现了。制药公司也发现了。

Depression and anxiety may be real. But they can also be Resistance.

抑郁和焦虑可能是真的。但也可能只是内阻力作祟。

When we drug ourselves to blot out our soul's call, we are being good Americans and exemplary consumers. We're doing exactly what TV commercials and pop materialist culture have been brainwashing us to do from birth. Instead of applying self-knowledge, self-discipline, delayed gratification and hard work, we simply consume a product.

当我们用药物来掩盖我们灵魂的呼唤时，我们就是优良的美国人，模范的消费者。我们所做的，正是电视广告和物质主义流行文化从我们出生起就不断给我们洗脑并灌输的事情。不是运用自知、自律、延迟满足和努力工作来治愈自己，而是简单地买样东西就好。

Many pedestrians have been maimed or killed at the intersection of Resistance and Commerce.

在内阻力与商业交会的十字路口，已经有许多行路人受伤致残，甚至死去。

## RESISTANCE AND VICTIMHOOD

Doctors estimate that seventy to eighty percent of their business is non-health-related. People aren't sick, they're self-dramatizing. Sometimes the hardest part of a medical job is keeping a straight face. As Jerry Seinfeld observed of his twenty years of dating: "That's a lot of acting fascinated."

医生们估计，他们的业务中有百分之七十到八十与健康无关。人们没有生病，只是在自己加戏。有时，治疗工作中最困难的部分是忍住不笑。正如杰瑞·宋飞在他20年的约会生涯中观察到的：“太多人演戏入了迷。”

The acquisition of a condition lends significance to one's existence. An illness, a cross to bear. Some people go from condition to condition; they cure one, and another pops up to take its place. The condition becomes a work of art in itself, a shadow version of the real creative act the victim is avoiding by expending so much care cultivating his condition.

生病，对一个人的存在而言具有重要意义。一种疾病，一个需要背负的十字架。有人不断生病，一种病好了，另一种又来了。这种疾病本身就成了一件艺术品，一个创造性行为的影子版本，受害者花费大量心血培育他的病症，从而规避从事真正有创造性的工作。

A victim act is a form of passive aggression. It seeks to achieve gratification not by honest work or a contribution made out of one's experience or insight or love, but by the manipulation of others through silent (and not-so-silent) threat. The victim compels others to come to his rescue or to behave as he wishes by holding them hostage to the prospect of his own further illness/meltdown/mental dissolution, or simply by threatening to make their lives so miserable that they do what he wants.

受害者行为则是被动进攻的一种形式。它不是通过诚实的工作或凭借个人经验、洞察力与爱而做出的贡献来获得满足，它所追求的，是用无声（或者不那么“无声”）的威胁来操纵他人。受害者迫使他人来拯救他；以避免病情恶化/崩溃/精神分裂为理由，挟持他人按照自己的意愿行事；又或者，只是简单地以会让他人生活陷入悲惨境地为威胁，逼迫他人去做他想要做的事。

Casting yourself as a victim is the antithesis of doing your work. Don't do it. If you're doing it, stop.

将自己塑造成受害者跟投入工作是对立的。不要这样做。如果你正在这样做，停下来。

## RESISTANCE AND THE CHOICE OF A MATE

Sometimes, if we're not conscious of our own Resistance, we'll pick as a mate someone who has or is successfully overcoming Resistance. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's easier to endow our partner with the power that we in fact possess but are afraid to act upon. Maybe it's less threatening to believe that our beloved spouse is worthy to live out his or her unlived life, while we are not. Or maybe we're hoping to use our mate as a model. Maybe we believe (or wish we could) that some of our spouse's power will rub off on us, if we just hang around it long enough.

有时，当意识不到自己的内阻力时，我们会选择一个已经或正在成功克服内阻力的人作为伴侣。我不知道为什么。也许赋予伴侣我们事实上拥有但又不敢采取行动的力量更容易。也许相信我们深爱的配偶值得过他或她未活过的生活，而我们却不值得，这样比较没有那么恐怖。或者我们希望用我们的伴侣做模特。也许我们相信（或者希望我们能相信），如果我们能在周围徘徊足够长的时间，我们配偶的力量就会对我们产生影响。

This is how Resistance disfigures love. The stew it creates is rich, it's colorful; Tennessee Williams could work it up into a trilogy. But is it love? If we're the supporting partner, shouldn't we face our own failure to pursue our unlived life, rather than hitchhike on our spouse's coattails? And if we're the supported partner, shouldn't we step out from the glow of our loved one's adoration and instead encourage him to let his own light shine?

内阻力就是这样摧毁爱情的。它造出无数烦恼，五花八门——足够田纳西·威廉姆斯写出一套三部曲。但这是爱吗？如果我们是提供支持的伴侣，难道不应该面对自己的失败，去追求自己未曾活过的人生，而不是指望搭配偶的顺风车吗？如果我们是被支持的伴侣，难道不应该走出爱人崇拜的光环，鼓励他/她自己发光发亮吗？

## RESISTANCE AND THIS BOOK

When I began this book, Resistance almost beat me. This is the form it took. It told me (the voice in my head) that I was a writer of fiction, not nonfiction, and that I shouldn't be exposing these concepts of Resistance literally and overtly; rather, I should incorporate them metaphorically into a novel. That's a pretty damn subtle and convincing argument. The rationalization Resistance presented me with was that I should write, say, a war piece in which the principles of Resistance were expressed as the fear a warrior feels.

在我开始创作这本书时，也差一点就被内阻力打败了。它是这么做的。它（我脑海中的声音）告诉我，我是一个小说作者，而不是非虚构作家，我不应该这样直白地公然揭示这些有关内阻力的概念；相反，我应该利用隐喻，把它们植入某部小说中。这个论点相当精妙，很有说服力。紧接着，内阻力就给出它的合理化建议：我应该写一部战争小说，通过一名战士所感受到的恐惧来阐释内阻力的原则。

Resistance also told me I shouldn't seek to instruct, or put myself forward as a purveyor of wisdom; that this was vain, egotistical, possibly even corrupt, and that it would work harm to me in the end. That scared me. It made a lot of sense.

内阻力还告诉我，我不应该试图去指导别人，也不应该自视为智慧的提供者——这是虚荣的，利己主义的，甚至可能是腐败堕落的，到头来终究会对我自己造成伤害。我被吓到了。这话说得很有道理。

What finally convinced me to go ahead was simply that I was so unhappy not going ahead. I was developing symptoms. As soon as I sat down and began, I was okay.

最终说服我继续前进的理由很简单，不继续前进会让我不快乐。我已经开始出现一些症状。可一旦坐下来开始工作，我就好了。

## RESISTANCE AND UNHAPPINESS

What does Resistance feel like?

内阻力带给人的感觉是什么？

First, unhappiness. We feel like hell. A low-grade misery pervades everything. We're bored, we're restless. We can't get no satisfaction. There's guilt but we can't put our finger on the source. We want to go back to bed; we want to get up and party. We feel unloved and unlovable. We're disgusted. We hate our lives. We hate ourselves.

首先，不快乐。我们感觉像在地狱里一样。低级的痛苦充斥着一切。我们无聊，我们不安。我们不能得到任何满足。我们心有负疚，却找不到原因。我们想回到床上，我们想起床玩乐。我们觉得不被爱也不值得被爱。我们满心憎恶。我们讨厌我们的生活。我们恨我们自己。

Unalleviated, Resistance mounts to a pitch that becomes unendurable. At this point vices kick in. Dope, adultery, web surfing.

如果纾解不了，内阻力就会上升到让人难以忍受的地步。在那一刻，恶习开始滋生。嗑药、通奸、沉溺网络。

Beyond that, Resistance becomes clinical. Depression, aggression, dysfunction. Then actual crime and physical self- destruction.

除此之外，内阻力还会转变成临床疾病。抑郁、攻击性、功能障碍。然后是实实在在的犯罪和肉体上的自我毁灭。

Sounds like life, I know. It isn't. It's Resistance.

我知道，这听上去就像是人生。其实不是。这是内阻力。

What makes it tricky is that we live in a consumer culture that's acutely aware of this unhappiness and has massed all its profit-seeking artillery to exploit it. By selling us a product, a drug, a distraction. John Lennon once wrote:

棘手的是，我们生活在一种消费主义文化中。消费主义文化能够敏锐地察觉到这种不快乐，并且迅速聚集起它所有逐利的炮火来利用这种不快乐。它售卖产品，售卖药物，售卖消遣。就像约翰·列侬写下的：

> Well, you think you're so clever and classless and free 
>
> But you're all fucking peasants 
>
> As far as I can see

As artists and professionals it is our obligation to enact our own internal revolution, a private insurrection inside our own skulls. In this uprising we free ourselves from the tyranny of consumer culture. We overthrow the programming of advertising, movies, video games, magazines, TV, and MTV by which we have been hypnotized from the cradle. We unplug ourselves from the grid by recognizing that we will never cure our restlessness by contributing our disposable income to the bottom line of Bullshit, Inc., but only by doing our work.

作为艺术家和专业人士，我们有义务发动我们自己内在的革命，在我们自己的头颅里掀起一场属于个人的起义。在这次起义中，我们要摆脱消费主义文化的暴政。我们要推翻广告、电影、游戏、杂志、电视和MTV编定的程序，这些东西从摇篮时期就开始催眠我们。我们拔掉电网插头，因为我们已经认识到，把可支配收入贡献给“狗屎股份有限公司”来完成它的底线目标，这永远无法疗愈我们的不安，唯一的办法，只有工作。

## RESISTANCE AND FUNDAMENTALISM

The artist and the fundamentalist both confront the same issue, the mystery of their existence as individuals. Each asks the same questions: Who am I? Why am I here? What is the meaning of my life?

艺术家和原教旨主义者都面临着同样的问题，即他们作为个体的存在之谜。每个人都会问同样的问题：我是谁？我为什么在这里？我的生命的意义是什么？

At more primitive stages of evolution, humanity didn't have to deal with such questions. In the states of savagery, of barbarism, in nomadic culture, medieval society, in the tribe and the clan, one's position was fixed by the commandments of the community. It was only with the advent of modernity (starting with the ancient Greeks), with the birth of freedom and of the individual, that such matters ascended to the fore.

在更早期的原始进化阶段，人类不必面对这样的问题。在原始状态、野蛮状态、游牧文明、中世纪社会、部落和氏族中，一个人的位置是由所在群体的诫命决定的。随着现代性的出现（从古希腊人开始），随着自由和个人概念的诞生，这类问题才日益凸显。

These are not easy questions. Who am I? Why am I here? They're not easy because the human being isn't wired to function as an individual. We're wired tribally, to act as part of a group. Our psyches are programmed by millions of years of hunter-gatherer evolution. We know what the clan is; we know how to fit into the band and the tribe. What we don't know is how to be alone. We don't know how to be free individuals.

这些并不是简单的问题。我是谁？我为什么在这里？它们不容易回答，因为人类并非天生独立运行的个体。我们是部落成员，作为团体的一部分行动。我们的心理由数百万年的“狩猎-采集”模式进化而来。我们知道宗族是什么，也知道如何融入人群和部落。我们所不知道的，是如何独处。我们不知道如何成为自由的个体。

The artist and the fundamentalist arise from societies at differing stages of development. The artist is the advanced model. His culture possesses affluence, stability, enough excess of resource to permit the luxury of self-examination. The artist is grounded in freedom. He is not afraid of it. He is lucky. He was born in the right place. He has a core of self- confidence, of hope for the future. He believes in progress and evolution. His faith is that humankind is advancing, however haltingly and imperfectly, toward a better world.

艺术家和原教旨主义者出现在社会的不同发展阶段。艺术家是高级模式。他们的文化丰裕而稳定，拥有充足的富余资源，让他们能够奢侈地进行自我审视。艺术家立足于自由，他不害怕自由。他是幸运的，出生在正确的地方。有自信的内核，对未来充满希望。他相信进步和进化。他的信念是：无论经历多少波折，有过多少不完美，人类始终在向着一个更美好的世界前进。

The fundamentalist entertains no such notion. In his view, humanity has fallen from a higher state. The truth is not out there awaiting revelation; it has already been revealed. The word of God has been spoken and recorded by His prophet, be he Jesus, Muhammad, or Karl Marx.

原教旨主义者不接受这样的观点。在他看来，人类已经从一个更高的状态跌落，并没有什么真实等待发觉——它早已亮相。无论耶稣、穆罕默德，还是卡尔·马克思，神谕都已经由他的先知说出并记录在案了。

Fundamentalism is the philosophy of the powerless, the conquered, the displaced and the dispossessed. Its spawning ground is the wreckage of political and military defeat, as Hebrew fundamentalism arose during the Babylonian captivity, as white Christian fundamentalism appeared in the American South during Reconstruction, as the notion of the Master Race evolved in Germany following World War I. In such desperate times, the vanquished race would perish without a doctrine that restored hope and pride. Islamic fundamentalism ascends from the same landscape of despair and possesses the same tremendous and potent appeal.

原教旨主义是无力者、被征服者、流离失所者和被剥夺者的哲学。它的发源地是政治和军事失败的残骸——古巴比伦人被囚禁期间，希伯来原教旨主义兴起；美国重建期间，白人基督教原教旨主义出现在美国南部；第一次世界大战后，优等种族的概念在德国衍生发展。在那样绝望的时代，如果没有恢复希望和自豪感的学说，被征服的民族就会灭亡。

What exactly is this despair? It is the despair of freedom. The dislocation and emasculation experienced by the individual cut free from the familiar and comforting structures of the tribe and the clan, the village and the family.

It is the state of modern life.

这是现代生活的状态。

The fundamentalist (or, more accurately, the beleaguered individual who comes to embrace fundamentalism) cannot stand freedom. He cannot find his way into the future, so he retreats to the past. He returns in imagination to the glory days of his race and seeks to reconstitute both them and himself in their purer, more virtuous light. He gets back to basics. To fundamentals.

原教旨主义者（更准确地说，是那些身处困境因而拥护原教旨主义的人）无法忍受自由。他找不到通向未来的路，于是退回到过去。他在想象中回到了自己种族的辉煌时期，并试图在更纯净、更高尚的光晕之下重建种族和他自身。他回归基础。回归了最初的教义。

Fundamentalism and art are mutually exclusive. There is no such thing as fundamentalist art. This does not mean that the fundamentalist is not creative. Rather, his creativity is inverted. He creates destruction. Even the structures he builds, his schools and networks of organization, are dedicated to annihilation, of his enemies and of himself.

原教旨主义和艺术是相互排斥的。根本就不存在原教旨主义艺术这种东西。但这并不意味着原教旨主义者没有创造力。就某种层面而言，他的创造力颠倒了。他制造毁灭。即使是他所建立的——他的学校，他们的组织网络——也一视同仁地致力于将他的敌人和他自己一起消灭。

But the fundamentalist reserves his greatest creativity for the fashioning of Satan, the image of his foe, in opposition to which he defines and gives meaning to his own life. Like the artist, the fundamentalist experiences Resistance. He experiences it as temptation to sin. Resistance to the fundamentalist is the call of the Evil One, seeking to seduce him from his virtue. The fundamentalist is consumed with Satan, whom he loves as he loves death. Is it coincidence that the suicide bombers of the World Trade Center frequented strip clubs during their training, or that they conceived of their reward as a squadron of virgin brides and the license to ravish them in the fleshpots of heaven? The fundamentalist hates and fears women because he sees them as vessels of Satan, temptresses like Delilah who seduced Samson from his power.

但原教旨主义者将他最大的创造力都用在了塑造撒旦的形象上，那是他的敌人，而不是定义自己的生命并赋予其意义。和艺术家一样，原教旨主义者也会面对内阻力。他体验到的是犯罪的诱惑。原教旨主义者的内阻力是邪恶的召唤，试图引诱他放弃他坚守的美德。原教旨主义者被撒旦吞噬，他爱撒旦，就像爱死亡一样。世界贸易中心的自杀式炸弹袭击者在训练期间经常光顾脱衣舞俱乐部，他们想象自己的奖励是一队处女新娘，以及在天堂的酒池肉林中蹂躏她们的许可。这些都是巧合吗？原教旨主义者憎恨女性，也害怕女性，他们将女性视为撒旦的容器，认为她们是诱惑者，就像《旧约》里诱惑参孙丢失神力的黛利拉。

To combat the call of sin, i.e., Resistance, the fundamentalist plunges either into action or into the study of sacred texts. He loses himself in these, much as the artist does in the process of creation. The difference is that while the one looks forward, hoping to create a better world, the other looks backward, seeking to return to a purer world from which he and all have fallen.

为了对抗罪恶的召唤，也就是内阻力，原教旨主义者要么投入行动，要么投入对神圣文本的研究。他迷失在这些之中，就像艺术家在创作过程中所做的那样。不同的是，一个向前看，希望创造一个更好的世界，另一个向后看，寻求回到一个更纯净的世界，一个他和所有人都从中跌落的世界。

The humanist believes that humankind, as individuals, is called upon to co-create the world with God. This is why he values human life so highly. In his view, things do progress, life does evolve; each individual has value, at least potentially, in advancing this cause. The fundamentalist cannot conceive of this. In his society, dissent is not just crime but apostasy; it is heresy, transgression against God Himself.

人道主义者认为，每一个人类个体都应当与神共同创造世界。这就是他们如此珍视人类生命的原因。在他们看来，事情在进步，生活在进化；每一个个体在推动这一进程上都有价值，至少是蕴含着价值。原教旨主义者无法想象这一点。在他的社会里，异议不仅是犯罪，更是叛教——那是异端邪说，是对最高神明本身的亵渎。

When fundamentalism wins, the world enters a dark age. Yet still I can't condemn one who is drawn to this philosophy. I consider my own inner journey, the advantages I've had of education, affluence, family support, health, and the blind good luck to be born American, and still I have learned to exist as an autonomous individual, if indeed I have, only by a whisker, and at a cost I would hate to have to reckon up.

如果原教旨主义获胜，世界将会进入黑暗时代。尽管如此，我仍然不能谴责任何一个被这种哲学所吸引的人。我思考了一下自己的内心旅程，我拥有教育经历、物质财富、家庭支持、健康等各方面的优势，还占了投生在这个国家的盲盒好运，却依然需要学习如何作为一个自主的个体而存在，如果说我是真的学会了，哪怕只是一点皮毛，那也是付出了我不愿去计算的代价。

It may be that the human race is not ready for freedom. The air of liberty may be too rarefied for us to breathe. Certainly I wouldn't be writing this book, on this subject, if living with freedom were easy. The paradox seems to be, as Socrates demonstrated long ago, that the truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery. While those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them.

或许是人类还没有准备好面对自由。或许是自由的空气太稀薄，让我们难以呼吸。的确，如果自由的生活很容易，我也就不用写这本书了。正如苏格拉底在很久以前已经证明了的，这其中似乎存在一个悖论：真正自由的个体，只有在他能够自我约束的范围内才是自由的。而不愿自我管理的人，则注定要找到主人来管理自己。

## RESISTANCE AND CRITICISM

If you find yourself criticizing other people, you're probably doing it out of Resistance. When we see others beginning to live their authentic selves, it drives us crazy if we have not lived out our own.

当你发现自己在批评别人，那很可能就是内阻力作祟。当我们看到别人开始活出真实的自我，而自己却做不到时，那是足以让我们发疯的。

Individuals who are realized in their own lives almost never criticize others. If they speak at all, it is to offer encouragement. Watch yourself. Of all the manifestations of Resistance, most only harm ourselves. Criticism and cruelty harm others as well.

活出了自我的个体几乎从不批评他人。如果他们开口说话，一定是为了鼓励。小心。在内阻力的诸多表现中，大多数只会伤害我们自己，但批评和冷酷却会伤害他人。

## RESISTANCE AND SELF-DOUBT

Self-doubt can be an ally. This is because it serves as an indicator of aspiration. It reflects love, love of something we dream of doing, and desire, desire to do it. If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), "Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?" chances are you are.

The counterfeit innovator is wildly self-confident. The real one is scared to death.

自我怀疑可以成为我们的盟友。因为它是抱负的指标。它反映了爱与渴望，对我们梦想的事情的爱，对实践这件事的渴望。如果你突然发现自己开始自省（或询问你的朋友）：“我真的算是一个作家吗？我真的是一个艺术家吗？”很大概率上，你就是。冒牌的创新者总是极度自信，而真正的那位却心虚得要命。

## RESISTANCE AND FEAR

Are you paralyzed with fear? That's a good sign.

你被吓瘫了吗？这是个好兆头。

Fear is good. Like self-doubt, fear is an indicator. Fear tells us what we have to do.

恐惧是好事。跟自我怀疑一样，恐惧也是一个指标。恐惧告诉我们，什么是必须做的。

Remember our rule of thumb: The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it.

记住我们的经验法则：越是害怕一份工作或召唤，我们就越能确定，它是我们必须做的。

Resistance is experienced as fear; the degree of fear equates to the strength of Resistance. Therefore the more fear we feel about a specific enterprise, the more certain we can be that that enterprise is important to us and to the growth of our soul. That's why we feel so much Resistance. If it meant nothing to us, there'd be no Resistance.

内阻力被体验为恐惧；恐惧的程度相当于内阻力的强度。因此，我们对某一特定事业的恐惧越大，就越能确信该事业对我们和我们的灵魂成长很重要。这就是为什么我们会感到如此强烈的内阻力。如果它对我们毫无意义，就不会有内阻力出现。

Have you ever watched *Inside the Actors Studio*? The host, James Lipton, invariably asks his guests, "What factors make you decide to take a particular role?" The actor always answers: "Because I'm afraid of it."

你看过《演员工作室》这档节目吗？主持人詹姆斯·利普顿总是问他的客人们：“是什么原因让你决定扮演这个角色？”演员总是回答：“因为它让我害怕。”

The professional tackles the project that will make him stretch. He takes on the assignment that will bear him into uncharted waters, compel him to explore unconscious parts of himself.

专业的人倾向于处理能够拓展他极限的项目。他接受的任务会带他进入未知水域，迫使他探索自己的无意识部分。

Is he scared? Hell, yes. He's petrified.

他害怕吗？当然。他怕死了。

(Conversely, the professional turns down roles that he's done before. He's not afraid of them anymore. Why waste his time?)

（相反，专业的人拒绝扮演曾经扮演过的角色。他不再害怕它们了。为什么还要在上面浪费时间？）

So if you're paralyzed with fear, it's a good sign. It shows you what you have to do.

所以，如果你因恐惧而感到手脚麻痹，这是个好兆头。它在告诉你，你应该做什么。

## RESISTANCE AND LOVE

Resistance is directly proportional to love. If you're feeling massive Resistance, the good news is, it means there's tremendous love there too. If you didn't love the project that is terrifying you, you wouldn't feel anything. The opposite of love isn't hate; it's indifference.

The more Resistance you experience, the more important your unmanifested art/project/enterprise is to you — and the more gratification you will feel when you finally do it.

内阻力与爱成正比。如果你感到巨大的内阻力，恭喜你，这意味着那里也有巨大的爱。如果不喜欢这个让你害怕的项目，你不会有任何感觉。爱的反面不是恨，是冷漠。你经受的内阻力越大，那尚未呈现的艺术/项目/事业对你来说就越重要，当你最终做到时，就越能感到满足。

## RESISTANCE AND BEING A STAR

Grandiose fantasies are a symptom of Resistance. They're the sign of an amateur. The professional has learned that success, like happiness, comes as a by-product of work.

The professional concentrates on the work and allows rewards to come or not come, whatever they like.

夸张的幻想是内阻力的表现之一。他们是业余爱好者的标志。职业选手早已懂得，成功和幸福一样，都是工作的副产品。职业选手专注于工作本身，至于奖励来还是不来，听其自然就好。

## RESISTANCE AND ISOLATION

Sometimes we balk at embarking on an enterprise because we're afraid of being alone. We feel comfortable with the tribe around us; it makes us nervous going off into the woods on our own.

有时我们因为害怕孤单而不敢着手于某项事业。身在部落之中时，我们感觉很安心。而孤身一人走进森林，则会让我们紧张。

Here's the trick: We're never alone. As soon as we step outside the campfire glow, our Muse lights on our shoulder like a butterfly. The act of courage calls forth infallibly that deeper part of ourselves that supports and sustains us.

然而，问题在于：我们从不孤单。一旦走出营地篝火笼罩的范围，缪斯女神就会像蝴蝶一样停在我们的肩头发光。充满勇气的行为必将唤起我们内心深处的那个部分，它会支持我们，支撑我们。

Have you seen interviews with the young John Lennon or Bob Dylan, when the reporter tries to ask about their personal selves? The boys deflect these queries with withering sarcasm. Why? Because Lennon and Dylan know that the part of them that writes the songs is not "them," not the personal self that is of such surpassing fascination to their boneheaded interrogators. Lennon and Dylan also know that the part of themselves that does the writing is too sacred, too precious, too fragile to be redacted into sound bites for the titillation of would-be idolators (who are themselves caught up in their own Resistance). So they put them on and blow them off.

你看过约翰·列侬或鲍勃·迪伦年轻时的访谈吗？当记者问到有关他们自身的问题时，男孩们用尖刻的讽刺来转移这些疑问。为什么？因为列侬和迪伦知道，创作出那些歌曲并不是“他们自己”，并不是那个对没有脑筋的访问者来说极具魅力的“人”本身。列侬和迪伦还知道，自己身上从事写作的那部分太神圣、太珍贵、太脆弱，无法拿出来剪辑成声音片段，用来愉悦那些可能的偶像崇拜者（这些崇拜者本身也深陷在他们自己的内阻力困扰之中）。所以他们就随便回答一下，搪塞了事。

It is a commonplace among artists and children at play that they're not aware of time or solitude while they're chasing their vision. The hours fly. The sculptress and the tree- climbing tyke both look up blinking when Mom calls, "Suppertime!"

这是艺术家和儿童玩耍时的共性，他们一心追逐自己的愿景，没有时间概念，不会觉得孤独。一晃就是几个小时。直到妈妈喊：“吃晚饭了！”雕塑家和爬树的孩子这才抬起头，眨眨眼睛。

## RESISTANCE AND ISOLATION, PART TWO

Friends sometimes ask, "Don't you get lonely sitting by yourself all day?" At first it seemed odd to hear myself answer No. Then I realized that I was not alone; I was in the book; I was with the characters. I was with my Self.

朋友们有时会问：“你一整天自己坐着不觉得孤独吗？”起初，听到自己回答“不”似乎很奇怪。但很快我就意识到，我并不孤独。我在书中，和角色们在一起。我在与我自己共处。

Not only do I not feel alone with my characters; they are more vivid and interesting to me than the people in my real life. If you think about it, the case can't be otherwise. In order for a book (or any project or enterprise) to hold our attention for the length of time it takes to unfold itself, it has to plug into some internal perplexity or passion that is of paramount importance to us. That problem becomes the theme of our work, even if we can't at the start understand or articulate it. As the characters arise, each embodies infallibly an aspect of that dilemma, that perplexity. These characters might not be interesting to anyone else but they're absolutely fascinating to us. They are us. Meaner, smarter, sexier versions of ourselves. It's fun to be with them because they're wrestling with the same issue that has its hooks into us. They're our soul mates, our lovers, our best friends. Even the villains. Especially the villains.

跟我的角色们在一起时，我不但不觉得孤单，事实上，在我看来，他们比现实生活中的人更加生动有趣。想想看吧，事情其实就是这样。要让一本书（或任何项目、事业）在整个开展的过程中始终牢牢抓住我们的注意力，就必然需要插入一些触及我们内心的内在困惑或激情，这些东西对我们来说至关重要。这个问题成为我们工作的主题，即使我们一开始也无法理解或表达它。然而，一个又一个角色登场，每一个都不可避免地展现出这种困境和困惑的某个侧面。这些角色在其他人眼里可能并不多么有趣，但对我们来说，绝对是迷人的。他们就是我们。更刻薄、更聪明、更性感的我们。和他们相处很有趣，因为他们在与同样的问题作斗争，这些问题本就深深困扰着我们。他们是我们的灵魂伴侣，我们的爱人，我们最好的朋友。就算反派也不例外。或者说，反派尤其如此。

Even in a book like this, which has no characters, I don't feel alone because I'm imagining the reader, whom I conjure as an aspiring artist much like my own younger, less grizzled self, to whom I hope to impart a little starch and inspiration and prime, a little, with some hard-knocks wisdom and a few tricks of the trade.

即使是在这样一本没有人物的书中，我也不会感到孤独，因为我在想象读者。我把他想象成一个有抱负的艺术家，就像头发还没有这么灰白的年轻时候的自己一样。我希望能为他输送一点营养，一点灵感，一点青春，一些由苦难挫折中得来的智慧和技巧。

## RESISTANCE AND HEALING

Have you ever spent time in Santa Fe? There's a subculture of "healing" there. The idea is that there's something therapeutic in the atmosphere. A safe place to go and get yourself together. There are other places (Santa Barbara and Ojai, California, come to mind), usually populated by upper- middle-class people with more time and money than they know what to do with, in which a culture of healing also obtains. The concept in all these environments seems to be that one needs to complete his healing before he is ready to do his work.

你在圣达菲待过吗？那里有一种“治愈”的亚文化。这种文化认为，圣达菲的氛围有某种疗愈的功效。这是一个安全的地方，能让人振作起来。还有一些地方（比如说，加利福尼亚州的圣巴巴拉和奥贾伊），居民通常都是中上阶层人士，有的是时间和金钱不知道该如何打发，那些地方也有疗愈的文化。在这类环境中，人们的概念似乎都是，在开始工作以前，人需要先完成他的治疗。

This way of thinking (are you ahead of me?) is a form of Resistance.

这种思考的方式（你是不是已经比我先想到了？），是内阻力的一种表现形式。

What are we trying to heal, anyway? The athlete knows the day will never come when he wakes up pain-free. He has to play hurt.

我们到底在试图治愈什么？运动员知道，永远不会有那么一天，他醒来时没有疼痛。他必须一直带着伤病比赛。

Remember, the part of us that we imagine needs healing is not the part we create from; that part is far deeper and stronger. The part we create from can't be touched by anything our parents did, or society did. That part is unsullied, uncorrupted; soundproof, waterproof, and bulletproof. In fact, the more troubles we've got, the better and richer that part becomes.

记住，我们以为需要治愈的那部分，并不是我们创造力的来源，后者要深刻、强大得多。我们的创造力来源是父母或社会所做的任何事情都触碰不到的。那个部分是纯洁无瑕、不被侵蚀的。隔音，防水，防弹。事实上，我们遇到的困难越多，那个部分就越美好、越丰盈。

The part that needs healing is our personal life. Personal life has nothing to do with work. Besides, what better way of healing than to find our center of self-sovereignty? Isn't that the whole point of healing?

需要治愈的只是我们的个人生活。个人生活与工作无关。再说了，还有什么是比找到自我主权的中心更好的治愈呢？这难道不是治愈的全部意义吗？

I washed up in New York a couple of decades ago, making twenty bucks a night driving a cab and running away full- time from doing my work. One night, alone in my $110-a- month sublet, I hit bottom in terms of having diverted myself into so many phony channels so many times that I couldn't rationalize it for one more evening. I dragged out my ancient Smith-Corona, dreading the experience as pointless, fruitless, meaningless, not to say the most painful exercise I could think of. For two hours I made myself sit there, torturing out some trash that I chucked immediately into the shitcan. That was enough. I put the machine away. I went back to the kitchen. In the sink sat ten days of dishes. For some reason I had enough excess energy that I decided to wash them. The warm water felt pretty good. The soap and sponge were doing their thing. A pile of clean plates began rising in the drying rack. To my amazement I realized I was whistling.

几十年前，我在纽约漂泊，开出租车，一晚上挣20美金，全力逃避我本该做的工作。直到一天晚上，我独自待在每月花上110美元转租来的小屋里，心情跌到了谷底，我无数次把自己引上无数条自欺欺人的道路，可现在，我再也无法心安理得地度过又一个这样的夜晚了。我拖出我古老的史密斯·科罗纳打字机，一边担心着这样的尝试是毫无意义的，没有结果，没有价值，更不用说，这是我能想到的最痛苦的练习了。我强迫自己坐了两个小时，满心痛苦地折腾出一些垃圾，转头就扔进垃圾桶里。够了。我把这机器收起来。回到厨房。水槽里堆着十天没洗的盘子。出于某种原因，我有足够的多余精力，我决定洗掉它们。温水感觉真好。洗洁精和海绵各司其职。沥水架上升起了一堆干净的盘子。我惊讶地发现自己还吹起了口哨。

It hit me that I had turned a corner. I was okay. I would be okay from here on.

这让我突然意识到，我刚刚走出了一个死角。

我好了。

从这一刻开始，我就好了。

Do you understand? I hadn't written anything good. It might be years before I would, if I ever did at all. That didn't matter. What counted was that I had, after years of running from it, actually sat down and done my work.

你能明白吗？我并没有写出任何像样的东西。那可能还要等上好几年——如果我真的能写出什么像样的东西的话。但那不重要。重要的是，在多年的逃避之后，我终于坐下来，做了我该做的工作。

Don't get me wrong. I've got nothing against true healing. We all need it. But it has nothing to do with doing our work and it can be a colossal exercise in Resistance. Resistance loves "healing." Resistance knows that the more psychic energy we expend dredging and re-dredging the tired, boring injustices of our personal lives, the less juice we have to do our work.

别误会。我对真正的治疗毫无异议。我们都需要它。但是它与做我们的工作毫不相关，它可能是内阻力的一次大规模演习。内阻力热爱“治愈”。它知道，我们越是耗费精神能量来一而再、再而三地试图疏导个人生活中遭遇的那些烦人又乏味的不公，就越是没法积攒起足够的能量去做我们本该做的工作。

## RESISTANCE AND SUPPORT

Have you ever been to a workshop? These boondoggles are colleges of Resistance. They ought to give out Ph.D.'s in Resistance. What better way of avoiding work than going to a workshop? But what I hate even worse is the word support.

你去过工作坊吗？这些不知所谓的东西简直就是内阻力学院。这些人应该被颁发内阻力学博士学位。还有什么是比“去工作坊”更方便用来逃避工作的吗？但我更讨厌的，是“支持”这个词。

Seeking support from friends and family is like having your people gathered around at your deathbed. It's nice, but when the ship sails, all they can do is stand on the dock waving goodbye.

寻求朋友和家人的支持就像让那些人聚集在你临终的床边。这很好。但是当船启航的时候，他们能做的也只是站在码头上挥挥手而已。

Any support we get from persons of flesh and blood is like Monopoly money; it's not legal tender in that sphere where we have to do our work. In fact, the more energy we spend stoking up on support from colleagues and loved ones, the weaker we become and the less capable of handling our business.

我们从有血有肉的人那里得到的一切支持，都不过是大富翁游戏里的钱——在我们必须工作的那个领域里，它并非法定货币。事实上，越是花费精力汲取同事和爱人的支持，我们就会变得越虚弱，越没有能力处理我们自己的事情。

My friend Carol had the following dream, at a time when her life felt like it was careening out of control:

She was a passenger on a bus. Bruce Springsteen was driving. Suddenly Springsteen pulled over, handed Carol the keys, and bolted. In the dream Carol was panicking. How could she drive this huge rolling Greyhound? By now all the passengers were staring. Clearly no one else was gonna step forward and take charge. Carol took the wheel. To her amazement, she found she could handle it.

我的朋友卡罗尔做过这样一个梦，那时候，她正觉得自己的生活开始倾斜失控。她是公交车上的一名乘客。布鲁斯·斯普林斯汀在开车。突然，斯普林斯汀停下车，把钥匙递给她，便离开了。梦中的卡罗尔惊慌失措。她怎么可能开得了这样一辆巨大的灰狗长途大巴呢？其他乘客全都盯着她看。显然，没有人会挺身而出。卡罗尔只能接过方向盘。可让她吃惊的是，她发现自己完全应付得了。

Later, analyzing the dream, she figured Bruce Springsteen was "The Boss." The boss of her psyche. The bus was the vehicle of her life. The Boss was telling Carol it was time to take the wheel. More than that, the dream, by actually setting her down in the driver's seat and letting her feel that she could control the vehicle on the road, was providing her with a simulator run, to prime her with the confidence that she could actually take command in her life.

卡罗尔后来自己分析过这个梦，认为布鲁斯·斯普林斯汀是“老板”。她精神上的老板。长途大巴是载着她生活前行的工具。老板告诉卡罗尔，是时候自己接过方向盘了。不仅如此，还安排她坐上驾驶座，通过这种方式让她体会到，她是有能力驾驶着这辆车上路的。这个梦为她提供了一次模拟演习，让她充满信心，相信自己完全可以掌控自己的人生。

A dream like that is real support. It's a check you can cash when you sit down, alone, to do your work.

这样的梦才是真正的支持。它是一张现金支票，当你独自坐下来工作时，就可以兑现。

P.S. When your deeper Self delivers a dream like that, don't talk about it. Don't dilute its power. The dream is for you. It's between you and your Muse. Shut up and use it.

附：当你的深层自我给了你这样的梦时，不要谈论它。不要稀释它的力量。那个梦是给你的。这是你和你的缪斯之间的事。闭上嘴，使用它。

The only exception is, you may share it with another comrade-in-arms, if sharing it will help or encourage that comrade in his or her own endeavors.

唯一的例外是，如果你有一位也在拼尽全力的战友，如果能够帮助或鼓励他或者她，那倒是不妨与之分享。

## RESISTANCE AND RATIONALIZATION

Rationalization is Resistance's right-hand man. Its job is to keep us from feeling the shame we would feel if we truly faced what cowards we are for not doing our work.

合理化是内阻力的左膀右臂。它的任务是让我们免于羞耻。毕竟，如果我们真能意识到自己是怎样一个逃避天赋使命的懦夫，是会感到羞耻的。

> MICHAEL: Don't knock rationalization. Where would we be without it? I don't know anyone who can get through the day without two or three juicy rationalizations. They're more important than sex. 不要批评合理化。没有它我们会在哪里？我不知道有谁能在没有两三个有趣的合理化解释的情况下度过一天。它们比性更重要。
>
> SAM: Aw, come on! Nothing's more important than sex. 噢，少来了！没有什么比性更重要了。
>
> MICHAEL: Oh yeah? Have you ever gone a week without a rationalization? 哦，是吗？你有过哪一个星期是完全不需要合理化解释就过完的吗？
>
>  — Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger, in Lawrence Kasdan's *The Big Chill*

But rationalization has its own sidekick. It's that part of our psyche that actually believes what rationalization tells us.

合理化有自己的帮手。那是我们心理上的一个部分，它真的愿意相信合理化解释所说的一切。

It's one thing to lie to ourselves. It's another thing to believe it.

骗自己是一回事。相信它是另一回事。

## RESISTANCE AND RATIONALIZATION, PART TWO

Resistance is fear. But Resistance is too cunning to show itself naked in this form. Why? Because if Resistance lets us see clearly that our own fear is preventing us from doing our work, we may feel shame at this. And shame may drive us to act in the face of fear.

内阻力就是恐惧。但是它太狡猾了，不会这样赤裸裸地展示自己。为什么？因为如果内阻力以本来面目示人，让我们清楚地看到，是我们自己内心的恐惧阻碍了我们的工作，我们多半会感到羞耻。而羞耻则可能驱使我们反过来直面恐惧，采取行动。

Resistance doesn't want us to do this. So it brings in Rationalization. Rationalization is Resistance's spin doctor. It's Resistance's way of hiding the Big Stick behind its back. Instead of showing us our fear (which might shame us and impel us to do our work), Resistance presents us with a series of plausible, rational justifications for why we shouldn't do our work.

内阻力不希望我们这样做。所以它招来了合理化。合理化是内阻力的代言人，会帮助它掩饰藏在身后的大棒。它不展示我们的恐惧（这可能会让我们感到羞耻，进而促使我们去做我们的工作），而是为我们提供了一系列看似中肯、合理的正当理由来解释，为什么我们不应该去做我们的工作。

What's particularly insidious about the rationalizations that Resistance presents to us is that a lot of them are true. They're legitimate. Our wife may really be in her eighth month of pregnancy; she may in truth need us at home. Our department may really be instituting a changeover that will eat up hours of our time. Indeed it may make sense to put off finishing our dissertation, at least till after the baby's born.

尤其阴险的是，内阻力向我们提出的合理化解释中，很多都是真实的。它们合情合理。我们的妻子可能真的怀孕八个月了。她可能真的需要我们在家陪伴。公司部门可能真的要进行一次大变更，那将占用我们很多时间。推迟完成论文确实可能是合适的选择——怎么说也要等到孩子出生之后吧。

What Resistance leaves out, of course, is that all this means diddly. Tolstoy had thirteen kids and wrote *War and Peace*. Lance Armstrong had cancer and won the Tour de France three years and counting.

当然，内阻力刻意忽略了一点：这些其实都不是重点。托尔斯泰有十三个孩子，还是写出了《战争与和平》。兰斯·阿姆斯特朗患上了癌症，还是连续三年在环法自行车赛上夺冠。

## RESISTANCE CAN BE BEATEN

If Resistance couldn't be beaten, there would be no Fifth Symphony, no *Romeo and Juliet*, no Golden Gate Bridge. Defeating Resistance is like giving birth. It seems absolutely impossible until you remember that women have been pulling it off successfully, with support and without, for fifty million years.

如果内阻力不能被打败，就不会有《第五交响曲》，不会有《罗密欧与朱丽叶》，也不会有金门大桥。打败内阻力就像分娩。看似绝无可能，可想一想，不管有没有获得“支持”，五千万年以来的女性都做到了。
