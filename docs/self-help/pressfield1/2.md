# COMBATING RESISTANCE: Turning Pro

> It is one thing to study war and another to live the warrior's life.

## PROFESSIONALS AND AMATEURS

Aspiring artists defeated by Resistance share one trait. They all think like amateurs. They have not yet turned pro.

有志于从事艺术创作却被内阻力击败的人都有一个共同点。他们都像业余爱好者一样思考。他们还没有成为职业选手。

The moment an artist turns pro is as epochal as the birth of his first child. With one stroke, everything changes. I can state absolutely that the term of my life can be divided into two parts: before turning pro, and after.

艺术家转变为职业选手的那一刻，就像他的第一个孩子出生那样代表着新纪元。转瞬之间，一切都改变了。我可以肯定地说，我自己的一生可以被分成两部分：成为职业选手之前和之后。

To be clear: When I say professional, I don't mean doctors and lawyers, those of "the professions." I mean the Professional as an ideal. The professional in contrast to the amateur. Consider the differences.

需要明确的是：我这里说的“职业”，并不是从事医生和律师等“职业”的人。我所说的“职业选手”是一种理想。“职业选手”的对比项是“业余爱好者”。想想其间的区别吧。

The amateur plays for fun. The professional plays for keeps. 

业余爱好者是为了好玩。职业选手志在必得。

To the amateur, the game is his avocation. To the pro it's his vocation.

对业余爱好者来说，比赛是他的消遣。而对职业选手来说，这是他的使命。

The amateur plays part-time, the professional full-time.

业余爱好者兼职，职业选手全职。

The amateur is a weekend warrior. The professional is there seven days a week.

业余爱好者是一名周末勇士。职业选手每周七天都在那里。

The word amateur comes from the Latin root meaning "to love." The conventional interpretation is that the amateur pursues his calling out of love, while the pro does it for money. Not the way I see it. In my view, the amateur does not love the game enough. If he did, he would not pursue it as a sideline, distinct from his "real" vocation.

“业余爱好者”一词源自拉丁语词根，意为“去爱”。传统的解释认为，业余爱好者追逐热爱，职业选手却是为了赚钱。我不这么看。在我看来，业余爱好者意味着对这项活动还不够热爱。如果足够热爱，就不会只把它作为一种副业来追求，与他的“正职”区分开来。

The professional loves it so much he dedicates his life to it. He commits full-time.

职业选手则不然，他们如此爱它，以至于不惜为它奉献一生。他无时无刻不投入其中。

That's what I mean when I say turning pro.

这就是我所说的“成为职业选手”。

Resistance hates it when we turn pro.

内阻力讨厌我们成为职业选手。

## A PROFESSIONAL

Someone once asked Somerset Maugham if he wrote on a schedule or only when struck by inspiration. "I write only when inspiration strikes," he replied. "Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o'clock sharp."

有人问萨默塞特·毛姆，他是按日程计划写作，还是只在有灵感的时候写作。“我只在灵感到来的时候写作，”毛姆回答，“幸运的是，它每天早上九点准时出现。”

That's a pro.

这就是职业选手。

In terms of Resistance, Maugham was saying, "I despise Resistance; I will not let it faze me; I will sit down and do my work."

关于内阻力，毛姆说：“我鄙视内阻力。我不会让它困扰我。我会坐下来，做我的工作。”

Maugham reckoned another, deeper truth: that by performing the mundane physical act of sitting down and starting to work, he set in motion a mysterious but infallible sequence of events that would produce inspiration, as surely as if the goddess had synchronized her watch with his.

毛姆还推测出了另一个更深刻的真相：通过坐下来开始工作这样一个平凡的身体动作，他启动了一系列神秘却精准无误的事件，从而引来了灵感，就像女神校准手表，与他的实现了同频共振一样。

He knew if he built it, she would come.

他知道，只要动手去做，她就会到来。

## WHAT A WRITER'S DAY FEELS LIKE

I wake up with a gnawing sensation of dissatisfaction. Already I feel fear. Already the loved ones around me are starting to fade. I interact. I'm present. But I'm not.

我醒来时会有一种痛苦的不满足感。我已经感到恐惧了。身边的亲友爱人已经渐渐开始消失。我互动。我在场。但实际上，我并不在。

I'm not thinking about the work. I've already consigned that to the Muse. What I am aware of is Resistance. I feel it in my guts. I afford it the utmost respect, because I know it can defeat me on any given day as easily as the need for a drink can overcome an alcoholic

我不去思考工作。我已经把它交给缪斯了。我觉察到的是内阻力。我感觉到它在我的身体里。我给予它最大限度的尊重，因为我知道，它随时可以击败我，不费吹灰之力，就像对酒的渴望能够轻松战胜酒鬼一样。

I go through the chores, the correspondence, the obligations of daily life. Again I'm there but not really. The clock is running in my head; I know I can indulge in daily crap for a little while, but I must cut it off when the bell rings.

我忙忙碌碌地做家务，读信写信，处理必须完成的日常琐事。同样的，我置身其中，却又不是真的在。时钟在我的脑子里运行。我知道，我可以短暂地沉迷于日常的鸡毛蒜皮，但当召唤铃响起，我就必须抽身。

I'm keenly aware of the Principle of Priority, which states (a) you must know the difference between what is urgent and what is important, and (b) you must do what's important first.

我很清楚什么是“优先原则”。它要求：（a）你必须知道什么是紧急的，什么是重要的；（b）你必须先做重要的事情。

What's important is the work. That's the game I have to suit up for. That's the field on which I have to leave everything I've got.

重要的是工作。这是我必须全副武装去面对的比赛，是我必须拼尽全力的赛场。

Do I really believe that my work is crucial to the planet's survival? Of course not. But it's as important to me as catching that mouse is to the hawk circling outside my window. He's hungry. He needs a kill. So do I.

我真的相信我的工作对地球的幸存至关重要吗？当然不是。但对我来说很重要，正如同抓住那只老鼠对在我窗外盘旋的鹰来说很重要。他饿了。他需要猎物。我也是。

I'm done with my chores now. It's time. I say my prayer and head out on the hunt.

我现在已经做完我的杂事了。到时间了。我说出我的祈祷词，开始狩猎。

The sun isn't up yet; it's cold; the fields are sopping. Brambles scratch my ankles, branches snap back in my face. The hill is a sonofabitch but what can you do? Set one foot in front of another and keep climbing.

太阳还没有升起；天气很冷；田野都湿透了。荆棘划伤了我的脚踝，树枝在我的脸上折断。这座山是个狗娘养的，但你又能怎么办？只能一步接着一步，继续往上爬。

An hour passes. I'm warmer now, the pace has got my blood going. The years have taught me one skill: how to be miserable. I know how to shut up and keep humping. This is a great asset because it's human, the proper role for a mortal. It does not offend the gods, but elicits their intercession. My bitching self is receding now. The instincts are taking over. Another hour passes. I turn the corner of a thicket and there he is: the nice fat hare I knew would show up if I just kept plugging.

一个小时过去了。我全身上下都开始暖和起来，迈步促进了我的血液流动。这些年的时光教会了我一项技能：如何痛苦。我学会了如何闭上嘴，继续艰苦跋涉。这是一笔巨大的财富，因为它是人性化的，是一个凡人应有的角色。它不会冒犯神灵，反倒能让他们同情我，提供庇护。我的怨气开始消退。本能开始接管一切。又过了一个小时。我转过灌木丛的角落，它在那里——我就知道，只要坚持，那只可爱的肥野兔就会出现。

Home from the hill, I thank the immortals and offer up their portion of the kill. They brought it to me; they deserve their share. I am grateful.

从山上回家，我感谢神灵，并献给他们猎物的一部分。他们把它带给了我，这些猎物是他们应得的。我很感恩。

I joke with my kids beside the fire. They're happy; the old man has brought home the bacon. The old lady's happy; she's cooking it up. I'm happy; I've earned my keep on the planet, at least for this day.

我在壁炉旁和孩子们开玩笑。他们很高兴——老头子带了培根回家。老妇人也很高兴，忙着用它们做饭。我也很高兴，至少在今天，我赚到了在这个星球生存的生活费。

Resistance is not a factor now. I don't think of the hunt and I don't think of the office. The tension drains from my neck and back. What I feel and say and do this night will not be coming from any disowned or unresolved part of me, any part corrupted by Resistance.



此刻，内阻力不再是我要考虑的因素。我不去想打猎的事情，也不想办公室。紧绷感渐渐从我的脖子和背上褪去。在这个夜晚，我所感受到的，所说的，所做的，都不会出自我内心任何不被承认或未被解决的部分，不会出自被内阻力毁坏的部分。

I go to sleep content, but my final thought is of Resistance. I will wake up with it tomorrow. Already I am steeling myself.

我心满意足地去睡觉，但睡着前划过脑海的最后一个念头还是内阻力。明天，我又将在它的纠缠下醒来。我这就开始为自己鼓劲了。

## HOW TO BE MISERABLE

In my younger days dodging the draft, I somehow wound up in the Marine Corps. There's a myth that Marine training turns baby-faced recruits into bloodthirsty killers. Trust me, the Marine Corps is not that efficient. What it does teach, however, is a lot more useful.

我在年轻时躲避征兵，不知怎么地，却最终加入了海军陆战队。他们都说，海军陆战队的训练能把娃娃脸新兵变成嗜血杀手。相信我，海军陆战队没有那么厉害。但是，它教会我的东西比那要有用得多。

The Marine Corps teaches you how to be miserable. This is invaluable for an artist.

海军陆战队教你如何痛苦。对艺术家来说，这是无价的。

Marines love to be miserable. Marines derive a perverse satisfaction from having colder chow, crappier equipment, and higher casualty rates than any outfit of dogfaces, swab jockeys or flyboys, all of whom they despise. Why? Because these candy-asses don't know how to be miserable.

海军陆战队喜欢痛苦。比起他们鄙视的步兵、骑兵或空军，海军陆战队员能在更冷的食物、更糟糕的装备和更高的伤亡率中获得一种异样的满足感。为什么？因为那些蠢人不知道如何痛苦。

The artist committing himself to his calling has volunteered for hell, whether he knows it or not. He will be dining for the duration on a diet of isolation, rejection, self-doubt, despair, ridicule, contempt, and humiliation.

不管有没有意识到，献身于个人感召的艺术家便已是志愿选择了地狱。在此期间，孤立、拒绝、自我怀疑、绝望、嘲笑、蔑视和羞辱就是他每日的食粮。

The artist must be like that Marine. He has to know how to be miserable. He has to love being miserable. He has to take pride in being more miserable than any soldier or swabbie or jet jockey. Because this is war, baby. And war is hell.

艺术家必须像个海军陆战队员一样。他必须知道如何痛苦。他必须热爱痛苦。他必须能为自己比任何士兵、水手或喷气机师都更痛苦而感到骄傲。因为这是战争，亲爱的。战争即地狱。

## WE'RE ALL PROS ALREADY

All of us are pros in one area: our jobs.

就本职工作而言，我们都是某个领域的职业选手。

We get a paycheck. We work for money. We are professionals.

我们有薪水。我们为钱工作。我们是职业选手。

Now: Are there principles we can take from what we're already successfully doing in our workaday lives and apply to our artistic aspirations? What exactly are the qualities that define us as professionals?

那么，我们是否可以审视平常生活中已经成功的事情，从中找出一些原则，并将它们应用于我们的艺术抱负？究竟是什么特质使我们被定义为职业选手？

1)   *We show up every day.* We might do it only because we have to, to keep from getting fired. But we do it. We show up every day. ① 我们每天都会出现。这或许只是因为我们不得不如此，不然就会遭到解雇。无论如何，我们做到了。每天都出现。

2)   *We show up no matter what.* In sickness and in health, come hell or high water, we stagger in to the factory. We might do it only so as not to let down our co-workers, or for other, less noble reasons. But we do it. We show up no matter what. ② 无论发生什么，我们都会出现。无论生病还是健康，哪怕天崩地裂，我们还是会跌跌撞撞地走进工厂。这或许只是为了不让同事失望，或是出于其他不那么高尚的原因。但是我们做到了。无论发生什么，我们都会出现。

3)   *We stay on the job all day.* Our minds may wander, but our bodies remain at the wheel. We pick up the phone when it rings, we assist the customer when he seeks our help. We don't go home till the whistle blows. ③ 我们整天都在岗位上。我们的脑子可能会走神，但身体仍在工作。当电话响起时，我们接电话。当客户寻求帮助时，我们帮助他。直到下班铃响起才回家。

4)   *We are committed over the long haul.* Next year we may go to another job, another company, another country. But we'll still be working. Until we hit the lottery, we are part of the labor force. ④ 我们致力于长远发展。明年我们可能会换另一份工作，另一家公司，另一个国家。但我们仍将继续工作。直到中彩票之前，我们都是劳动力的一部分。

5)   *The stakes for us are high and real.* This is about survival, feeding our families, educating our children. It's about eating. ⑤ 对我们来说，利益是巨大且真实的。这关乎生存、养家糊口、教育孩子。关系到吃饭。

6)   *We accept remuneration for our labor.* We're not here for fun. We work for money. ⑥ 我们接受劳动报酬。我们来这不是玩儿的。我们为钱工作。

7)   *We do not overidentify with our jobs.* We may take pride in our work, we may stay late and come in on weekends, but we recognize that we are not our job descriptions. The amateur, on the other hand, overidentifies with his avocation, his artistic aspiration. He defines himself by it. He is a musician, a painter, a playwright. Resistance loves this. Resistance knows that the amateur composer will never write his symphony because he is overly invested in its success and overterrified of its failure. The amateur takes it so seriously it paralyzes him. ⑦ 我们不会过分共情自己的工作。我们可能会为自己的工作感到自豪，可能会熬夜，周末也用来加班，但我们会意识到，我们自身不等同于我们工作的内容。反之，业余爱好者过度认同他的业余爱好、他的艺术抱负。他以此来定义自己。他是音乐家、画家、剧作家。内阻力最喜欢这样。内阻力知道，业余作曲家永远写不出他的交响乐，因为他对成功期望太高，对失败太过恐惧。业余爱好者把它看得太重了，以至于无法行动。

8)   *We master the technique of our jobs.* ⑧ 我们精通工作的技艺。

9)   *We have a sense of humor about our jobs.* ⑨ 我们对自己的工作葆有一份幽默感。

10)   *We receive praise or blame in the real world.* ⑩ 我们在现实世界中受到赞扬或指责。

Now consider the amateur: the aspiring painter, the wannabe playwright. How does he pursue his calling?

现在想想业余爱好者：有抱负的画家，想成为剧作家的人。他们又是如何追求自己的使命的呢？

One, he doesn't show up every day. Two, he doesn't show up no matter what. Three, he doesn't stay on the job all day. He is not committed over the long haul; the stakes for him are illusory and fake. He does not get money. And he overidentifies with his art. He does not have a sense of humor about failure. You don't hear him bitching, "This fucking trilogy is killing me!" Instead, he doesn't write his trilogy at all.

第一，他不是每天都出现。第二，他不是无论如何都出现。第三，他不是整天都在岗位上。他没有给出长期的承诺；对他来说，赌注是虚幻的、假的。他不赚钱。他对自己的艺术过于感同身受。他对失败没有幽默感。你不会听到他抱怨：“这该死的三部曲简直要了我的命！”相反，他根本不会动笔去写他的三部曲。

The amateur has not mastered the technique of his art. Nor does he expose himself to judgment in the real world. If we show our poem to our friend and our friend says, "It's wonderful, I love it," that's not real-world feedback, that's our friend being nice to us. Nothing is as empowering as real-world validation, even if it's for failure.

业余爱好者没有掌握艺术的技巧，也不愿将自己暴露在现实世界中接受评判。如果我们向朋友展示我们的诗歌，朋友会说：“太棒了，我爱这首诗”。这不是真实世界的反馈，而是朋友对我们的善意。没有什么比真实世界的验证更有力量，即使结果注定是失败。

The first professional writing job I ever had, after seventeen years of trying, was on a movie called *King Kong Lives*. I and my partner-at-the-time, Ron Shusett (a brilliant writer and producer who also did *Alien* and *Total Recall*) hammered out the screenplay for Dino DeLaurentiis. We loved it; we were sure we had a hit. Even after we'd seen the finished film, we were certain it was a blockbuster. We invited everyone we knew to the premiere, even rented out the joint next door for a post-triumph blowout. Get there early, we warned our friends, the place'll be mobbed.

在尝试了十七年之后，我的第一份职业写作的工作，是在一部叫作《金刚复活》的电影团队做编剧。我和那时的搭档罗恩·舒塞特（一位很有才华的作家和制片人，创作过《异形》和《全面回忆》）一起苦心为迪诺·德拉伦提斯锤炼剧本。我们很爱那个剧本，坚信我们能够成功。即便在看过成片之后，我们依然认定它会是一部轰动一时的大片。我们邀请认识的每一个人参加首映礼，甚至包下了隔壁的餐馆准备开庆功宴。“早点儿到”，我们提醒朋友们，这地方会堵得水泄不通。

Nobody showed. There was only one guy in line beside our guests and he was muttering something about spare change. In the theater, our friends endured the movie in mute stupefaction. When the lights came up, they fled like cockroaches into the night.

没有人出现。只有一个人在排队，在我们的客人们旁边，嘀咕着一些有关找零的事情。在剧院里，我们的朋友们静默而麻木地忍受着这部电影。灯光一亮，他们像蟑螂一样逃进了黑夜。

Next day came the review in *Variety*: ". . . Ronald Shusett and Steven Pressfield; we hope these are not their real names, for their parents' sake." When the first week's grosses came in, the flick barely registered. Still I clung to hope. Maybe it's only tanking in urban areas, maybe it's playing better in the burbs. I motored to an Edge City multiplex. A youth manned the popcorn booth. "How's *King Kong Lives*?" I asked. He flashed thumbs-down. "Miss it, man. It sucks."

第二天，《综艺》杂志上登出了评论：“……罗纳德·舒塞特和史蒂文·普莱斯菲尔德——希望这不是他们的真名，看在他们父母的份上。”当第一周的票房出现时，这部电影的成绩几乎可以忽略不计。我还是抱着一丝希望。也许它只是不受城里人欢迎呢，说不定在郊区的反响会好一点。我骑摩托车去了一个城郊的连锁影院。一个年轻人守在爆米花摊前。“《金刚复活》好看吗？”我问。他大拇指朝下一比：“别看，伙计。烂透了。”

I was crushed. Here I was, forty-two years old, divorced, childless, having given up all normal human pursuits to chase the dream of being a writer; now I've finally got my name on a big-time Hollywood production starring Linda Hamilton, and what happens? I'm a loser, a phony; my life is worthless, and so am I.

我被击垮了。那时的我，四十二岁，离异，没有孩子，放弃了一切平常人的追求去追寻写作的梦想。现在，我终于让自己的名字出现在了一部由琳达·汉密尔顿主演的好莱坞大制作的银幕上，可结果呢？我是一个失败者，一个赝品；我的人生一文不值，我也一样。

My friend Tony Keppelman snapped me out of it by asking if I was gonna quit. Hell, no! "Then be happy. You're where you wanted to be, aren't you? So you're taking a few blows. That's the price for being in the arena and not on the sidelines. Stop complaining and be grateful."

我的朋友托尼·凯佩尔曼问我是不是打算放弃，一下子把我拽出了这困境。“什么？当然不。”“那就开心点儿。你已经走到你梦想的地方了，不是吗？没错，你现在受到了一些打击。可这就是站上竞技场而不是待在场边观看的代价。别抱怨了，要感恩。”

That was when I realized I had become a pro. I had not yet had a success. But I had had a real failure.

就是在那一刻，我意识到自己已经成为了一名职业选手。我还没有成功。但我已经拥有了一次真正的失败。

## FOR LOVE OF THE GAME

To clarify a point about professionalism: The professional, though he accepts money, does his work out of love. He has to love it. Otherwise he wouldn't devote his life to it of his own free will.

澄清一点有关职业精神的问题：职业选手接受金钱报酬，但他也的确是因热爱而工作。他必须热爱它。否则就不会出于自由意志而甘愿将一生奉献给它。

The professional has learned, however, that too much love can be a bad thing. Too much love can make him choke. The seeming detachment of the professional, the cold-blooded character to his demeanor, is a compensating device to keep him from loving the game so much that he freezes in action. Playing for money, or adopting the attitude of one who plays for money, lowers the fever.

然而，职业选手已经懂得，太多的爱可能反倒是坏事。太多的爱会让他窒息。因此，职业选手看似态度冷漠，举止冷血，其实都只是补偿的手段，防止他太过于热爱这场游戏，以至于止步不前。为了钱上场，或者说，采取为钱上场的态度，可以降低狂热。

Remember what we said about fear, love, and Resistance. The more you love your art/calling/enterprise, the more important its accomplishment is to the evolution of your soul, the more you will fear it and the more Resistance you will experience facing it. The payoff of playing-the-game-for-money is not the money (which you may never see anyway, even after you turn pro). The payoff is that playing the game for money produces the proper professional attitude. It inculcates the lunch-pail mentality, the hard-core, hard-head, hard-hat state of mind that shows up for work despite rain or snow or dark of night and slugs it out day after day.

记住我们此前探讨过的恐惧、爱及内阻力的关系。你越热爱你的艺术/使命/企业，完成它对你的灵魂进化就越重要，因此，你就越害怕它，面对它时感受到的内阻力也就越大。为了钱上场，回报并不是钱（即使成为了职业选手，也可能永远都赚不到钱）。其中的好处在于，为钱上场能够培养出正确的职业态度。它灌输了一种像午餐饭盒一样的心态，一种风雨无阻、无论白天黑夜都会出现在工作岗位上的死原则、死脑筋、硬着头皮上的心态，让你能够日复一日地与内阻力死磕到底。

The writer is an infantryman. He knows that progress is measured in yards of dirt extracted from the enemy one day, one hour, one minute at a time and paid for in blood. The artist wears combat boots. He looks in the mirror and sees GI Joe. Remember, the Muse favors working stiffs. She hates prima donnas. To the gods the supreme sin is not rape or murder, but pride. To think of yourself as a mercenary, a gun for hire, implants the proper humility. It purges pride and preciousness.

作家就像步兵。他知道，进步是以每一天、每一小时、每一分钟从敌人那边挖出的泥土码数来衡量的，是用鲜血换来的。这样的艺术家穿的是作战靴。照镜子时，他看到的是大兵甲乙丙丁。记住，缪斯喜欢勤奋工作的人。她讨厌恃才傲物的家伙。对众神来说，最大的罪不是强奸或谋杀，而是骄傲。把自己想象成一名雇佣兵，一把被雇佣的枪，这会让你保有适当的谦卑。它能够洗去骄傲和自以为是。

Resistance loves pride and preciousness. Resistance says, "Show me a writer who's too good to take Job X or Assignment Y and I'll show you a guy I can crack like a walnut."

内阻力爱骄傲和自以为是。内阻力说：“给我一个因为写得太好而不能接受X工作或Y任务的写作者，我就让你看一个能被我像捏核桃一样捏碎的人。”

Technically, the professional takes money. Technically, the pro plays for pay. But in the end, he does it for love.

原则上说，职业选手是收钱的。更确切地讲，职业选手为报酬工作。但归根结底，他所做的一切都是出于热爱。

Now let's consider: What are the aspects of the Professional?

现在让我们思考一下：职业选手需要具备哪些素养？

## A PROFESSIONAL IS PATIENT

Resistance outwits the amateur with the oldest trick in the book: It uses his own enthusiasm against him. Resistance gets us to plunge into a project with an overambitious and unrealistic timetable for its completion. It knows we can't sustain that level of intensity. We will hit the wall. We will crash.

内阻力以书中最古老的伎俩战胜了业余爱好者：它利用他们自己的热情来对付他们。内阻力鼓动我们一头扎进某个项目，制定出一份雄心勃勃却不切实际的时间表。它知道我们无法维持这样的强度。我们会碰壁。会崩溃。

The professional, on the other hand, understands delayed gratification. He is the ant, not the grasshopper; the tortoise, not the hare. Have you heard the legend of Sylvester Stallone staying up three nights straight to churn out the screenplay for *Rocky*? I don't know, it may even be true. But it's the most pernicious species of myth to set before the awakening writer, because it seduces him into believing he can pull off the big score without pain and without persistence.

相反，职业选手懂得延迟满足。他们是蚂蚁，不是蚱蜢；是乌龟，不是兔子。你听过西尔维斯特·史泰龙连续三晚不眠不休完成《洛基》剧本的传奇故事吗？我不知道，也许是真的吧。但对于觉醒中的写作者来说，这是最有害的那一类故事，因为它会诱使他们相信，自己也可以不必经受痛苦和长久的坚持就获得成功。

The professional arms himself with patience, not only to give the stars time to align in his career, but to keep himself from flaming out in each individual work. He knows that any job, whether it's a novel or a kitchen remodel, takes twice as long as he thinks and costs twice as much. He accepts that. He recognizes it as reality.

职业选手用耐心武装自己，不仅是为自己的职业生涯留出从容的时间，还能够控制自己，在任何一项工作中都不至于因为过载而功亏一篑。他知道，任何一份工作，无论是小说创作还是厨房改造，所需要的时间都会是他预想的两倍，代价也是两倍。他接受这一点。承认这就是现实。

The professional steels himself at the start of a project, reminding himself it is the Iditarod, not the sixty-yard dash. He conserves his energy. He prepares his mind for the long haul. He sustains himself with the knowledge that if he can just keep those huskies mushing, sooner or later the sled will pull in to Nome.

职业选手会在一个项目启动之初就做好准备，提醒自己，这是阿拉斯加的狗拉雪橇比赛，而不是六十码短跑。他懂得保存能量。做好了打持久战的思想准备。他始终知道，只要能让哈士奇们一直向前，雪橇迟早能够抵达终点诺姆。

## A PROFESSIONAL SEEKS ORDER

When I lived in the back of my Chevy van, I had to dig my typewriter out from beneath layers of tire tools, dirty laundry, and moldering paperbacks. My truck was a nest, a hive, a hellhole on wheels whose sleeping surface I had to clear each night just to carve out a foxhole to snooze in.

当我住在我的雪佛兰厢式车后面时，每次都得从层层叠叠的轮胎工具、脏衣服和发霉的平装书下面把我的打字机挖出来。我的卡车就是一个窝，一个蜂巢，一个架在车轮上的鬼地方，我每晚都不得不清理睡觉的地方，只为掏出一个散兵坑，好躺进去打个盹。

The professional cannot live like that. He is on a mission. He will not tolerate disorder. He eliminates chaos from his world in order to banish it from his mind. He wants the carpet vacuumed and the threshold swept, so the Muse may enter and not soil her gown.

职业选手不能这样生活。他有任务在身。他不会容忍混乱。只有消除现实世界里的混乱，他才能消除脑海中的混乱。他希望地毯是用吸尘器吸过的，门槛是打扫干净的，这样，缪斯才有可能进来，而不必担心弄脏她的长裙。

## A PROFESSIONAL DEMYSTIFIES

A pro views her work as craft, not art. Not because she believes art is devoid of a mystical dimension. On the contrary. She understands that all creative endeavor is holy, but she doesn't dwell on it. She knows if she thinks about that too much, it will paralyze her. So she concentrates on technique. The professional masters how, and leaves what and why to the gods. Like Somerset Maugham she doesn't wait for inspiration, she acts in anticipation of its apparition. The professional is acutely aware of the intangibles that go into inspiration. Out of respect for them, she lets them work. She grants them their sphere while she concentrates on hers.

职业选手将自己的作品视为手艺，而非艺术。这并不是因为他们觉得艺术缺乏神秘的维度。恰恰相反。他们明白所有创造性的努力都是神圣的，只是并不纠结于此。他们知道，想得太多只会让自己束手束脚。所以他们专注于技艺。职业选手精通“如何做”，将“做什么”和“为什么做”留给众神。就像萨默塞特·毛姆一样，职业选手不坐等灵感到来，他们只管行动，同时心怀期待，希望它出现。职业选手敏锐地意识到灵感中难以捉摸的东西。出于尊重，他们让灵感自行其是。职业人士专注于自己的领域，并以此为灵感留出属于它的空间。

The sign of the amateur is overglorification of and preoccupation with the mystery.

业余爱好者的标志是对神秘的过分赞美和痴迷。

The professional shuts up. She doesn't talk about it. She does her work.

职业选手则会闭嘴。她不谈论它。她只管做她的工作。

## A PROFESSIONAL ACTS IN THE FACE OF FEAR

The amateur believes he must first overcome his fear; then he can do his work. The professional knows that fear can never be overcome. He knows there is no such thing as a fearless warrior or a dread-free artist.

业余爱好者相信他必须首先克服恐惧，然后才能开始工作。职业选手知道恐惧永远无法被克服。他知道世上没有无所畏惧的战士和不战战兢兢的艺术家。

What Henry Fonda does, after puking into the toilet in his dressing room, is to clean up and march out onstage. He's still terrified but he forces himself forward in spite of his terror. He knows that once he gets out into the action, his fear will recede and he'll be okay.

亨利·方达的做法是，在更衣室的马桶间里吐完，然后整理干净，走上舞台。他仍然害怕，但他逼迫自己强忍恐惧，继续前进。他知道，一旦投入行动，恐惧就会消退，他会没事的。

## A PROFESSIONAL ACCEPTS NO EXCUSES

The amateur, underestimating Resistance's cunning, permits the flu to keep him from his chapters; he believes the serpent's voice in his head that says mailing off that manuscript is more important than doing the day's work.

业余爱好者低估了内阻力的狡猾，允许流感引他放下手中的章节。他相信毒蛇在他脑子里的声音，说邮寄手稿比完成今天的工作更重要。

The professional has learned better. He respects Resistance. He knows if he caves in today, no matter how plausible the pretext, he'll be twice as likely to cave in tomorrow.

职业选手学到的更多。他尊重内阻力。他知道，无论借口多么合理，只要今天屈服了，明天屈服的可能性就会是今天的两倍。

The professional knows that Resistance is like a telemarketer; if you so much as say hello, you're finished. The pro doesn't even pick up the phone. He stays at work.

职业选手知道，内阻力就像电话销售，只要你回应一句“哈喽”，就完了。职业选手压根儿不接电话。他只是埋头工作。

## A PROFESSIONAL PLAYS IT AS IT LAYS

My friend the Hawk and I were playing the first hole at Prestwick in Scotland; the wind was howling out of the left. I started an eight-iron thirty yards to windward, but the gale caught it; I watched in dismay as the ball sailed hard right, hit the green going sideways, and bounded off into the cabbage. "Sonofabitch!" I turned to our caddie. "Did you see the wind take that shot!?"

我和我的朋友“老鹰”在苏格兰的普雷斯特维克打高尔夫，第一洞就遇上左边狂风大作。我用八号铁杆迎风开球，只打出了30码，大风截住了它；我惊愕地看着球向右侧飞去，撞到果岭上，再弹进卷心菜地里。“狗娘养的！”我转向球童，“你看到了吗？风把球打出去了！”

He gave that look that only Scottish caddies can give. "Well, ye've got t' play th' wind now, don't ye?"

他露出那个只有苏格兰球童才做得出的表情。“嗯，你现在得跟风比赛了，不是吗？”

The professional conducts his business in the real world. Adversity, injustice, bad hops and rotten calls, even good breaks and lucky bounces all comprise the ground over which the campaign must be waged. The field is level, the professional understands, only in heaven.

职业选手在现实世界中处理他的业务。逆境、不公、糟糕的跳槽、令人不适的电话，乃至于好的突破和幸运的反弹，共同组合成了这片战场，战役必将在这里打响。职业选手知道，一马平川的赛场只会出现在天堂。

## A PROFESSIONAL IS PREPARED

I'm not talking about craft; that goes without saying. The professional is prepared at a deeper level. He is prepared, each day, to confront his own self-sabotage.

我在这里说的不是技艺——那是不用说的。职业选手在更深的层次上做好了准备。每一天，他都准备着迎接来自自我的破坏。

The professional understands that Resistance is fertile and ingenious. It will throw stuff at him that he's never seen before.

职业选手明白内阻力是机巧多变的。它会向他扔下他从未见过的东西。

The professional prepares mentally to absorb blows and to deliver them. His aim is to take what the day gives him. He is prepared to be prudent and prepared to be reckless, to take a beating when he has to, and to go for the throat when he can. He understands that the field alters every day. His goal is not victory (success will come by itself when it wants to) but to handle himself, his insides, as sturdily and steadily as he can.

职业选手会在心理上做好准备，消化打击，并将它们输出。他的目标是接受每一天带给他的一切。他做好了谨慎和鲁莽的两手准备，在必要时挨打，在有机会时直击要害。他明白，战场每天都在变化。他的目标不是胜利（成功会在它愿意的时候自己到来），而是尽可能坚定、稳定地控制住自己，驾驭自己的内心。

## A PROFESSIONAL DOES NOT SHOW OFF

A professional's work has style; it is distinctively his own. But he doesn't let his signature grandstand for him. His style serves the material. He does not impose it as a means of drawing attention to himself.

职业选手的作品自有它的风格，这是他自己的，与众不同。但他不会用风格来哗众取宠。他的风格是为素材服务的。他不会把风格当作吸引关注的手段。

This doesn't mean that the professional doesn't throw down a 360 tomahawk jam from time to time, just to let the boys know he's still in business.

这并不意味着职业选手不会时不时地抛出一个360度大回旋的战斧大招，当然，只是为了让那些小子们知道，他宝刀未老。

## A PROFESSIONAL DEDICATES HIMSELF TO MASTERING TECHNIQUE

The professional respects his craft. He does not consider himself superior to it. He recognizes the contributions of those who have gone before him. He apprentices himself to them.

职业选手尊重他的技艺。他并不认为自己凌驾于技艺之上。他认可此前所有人做出的贡献。他将自己视作前人的学徒。

The professional dedicates himself to mastering technique not because he believes technique is a substitute for inspiration but because he wants to be in possession of the full arsenal of skills when inspiration does come. The professional is sly. He knows that by toiling beside the front door of technique, he leaves room for genius to enter by the back.

职业选手致力于掌握技艺，并不是因为他相信技艺可以替代灵感，而是希望在灵感到来时自己已经做好准备，掌握了全部技能。职业选手是狡黠的。他知道，通过在技术的前门苦练，就能为天才留出从后门进入的空间。

## A PROFESSIONAL DOES NOT HESITATE TO ASK FOR HELP

Tiger Woods is the greatest golfer in the world. Yet he has a teacher; he works with Butch Harmon. And Tiger doesn't endure this instruction or suffer through it — he revels in it. It's his keenest professional joy to get out there on the practice tee with Butch, to learn more about the game he loves.

泰格·伍兹是全世界最伟大的高尔夫球手。尽管如此，他依然有一位老师——他和布奇·哈蒙一起练习。“老虎”并非勉强忍受他的教导，也不觉得痛苦，事实上，他很享受。能和布奇一起站在开球点前练习，进一步了解他所热爱的这项运动，是他在职业生涯中最热衷的乐趣。

Tiger Woods is the consummate professional. It would never occur to him, as it would to an amateur, that he knows everything, or can figure everything out on his own. On the contrary, he seeks out the most knowledgeable teacher and listens with both ears. The student of the game knows that the levels of revelation that can unfold in golf, as in any art, are inexhaustible.

泰格·伍兹是一位完美的职业选手。他从来不会像业余爱好者一样，以为自己无所不知，以为只靠自己就能解决所有问题。相反，他寻找最富学识的老师，竖起双耳倾听。学习这项运动的人都知道，高尔夫和所有艺术门类一样，能带来的启示是无穷无尽的。

## A PROFESSIONAL DISTANCES HERSELF FROM HER INSTRUMENT

The pro stands at one remove from her instrument — meaning her person, her body, her voice, her talent; the physical, mental, emotional, and psychological being she uses in her work. She does not identify with this instrument. It is simply what God gave her, what she has to work with. She assesses it coolly, impersonally, objectively.

职业选手总是与他们的“乐器”保持距离——这里的“乐器”，指的是他们的人，他们的身体、声音、天赋；是他们在工作中需要调动的肢体、心理、情感和心理状态。他们不认为自己等同于这件“乐器”。这只是上帝赐予他们的工具，他们必须与之合作。他们会冷静、客观、不带个人偏好地去评估它。

The professional identifies with her consciousness and her will, not with the matter that her consciousness and will manipulate to serve her art. Does Madonna walk around the house in cone bras and come-fuck-me bustiers? She's too busy planning D-Day. Madonna does not identify with "Madonna." Madonna employs "Madonna."

职业选手认同的，是自己的意识和意愿，而不是意识和意愿所操纵的、为他们的艺术而服务的东西。麦当娜难道会穿着锥形胸罩和充满性邀请意味的紧身胸衣在家里走来走去吗？她忙着计划她的登陆日呢。麦当娜不会认为自己等同于“麦当娜”。麦当娜雇用“麦当娜”。

## A PROFESSIONAL DOES NOT TAKE FAILURE (OR SUCCESS) PERSONALLY

When people say an artist has a thick skin, what they mean is not that the person is dense or numb, but that he has seated his professional consciousness in a place other than his personal ego. It takes tremendous strength of character to do this, because our deepest instincts run counter to it. Evolution has programmed us to feel rejection in our guts. This is how the tribe enforced obedience, by wielding the threat of expulsion. Fear of rejection isn't just psychological; it's biological. It's in our cells.

当人们说一个艺术家厚脸皮时，他们的意思并不是说这个人迟钝或麻木，而是说他将自己的职业意识与个人的自我区分开来，放在了不同的地方。要做到这一点，需要极其坚强的个性，因为我们最深层的本能是与之背道而驰的。进化在我们的胆魄里织进了对拒绝的敏感。部落就是这样，通过驱逐的威胁来强制成员服从。害怕被拒绝不仅仅是心理问题，它是生物学的。它深植于我们的细胞里。

Resistance knows this and uses it against us. It uses fear of rejection to paralyze us and prevent us, if not from doing our work, then from exposing it to public evaluation. I had a dear friend who had labored for years on an excellent and deeply personal novel. It was done. He had it in its mailing box. But he couldn't make himself send it off. Fear of rejection unmanned him.

内阻力了解这个，并利用它来对抗我们。它利用对被拒绝的恐惧来麻痹我们，阻止我们行动：只要不完成我们的工作，就不用接受公众的评价。我有一位亲近的朋友，花了多年时间，努力创作出一部优秀而深刻的个人小说。一切都完成了。他把稿子放进邮箱，却怎么也没办法把它寄出去。对于被拒绝的恐惧抽干了他的勇气。

The professional cannot take rejection personally because to do so reinforces Resistance. Editors are not the enemy; critics are not the enemy. Resistance is the enemy. The battle is inside our own heads. We cannot let external criticism, even if it's true, fortify our internal foe. That foe is strong enough already.

职业选手不会把被拒绝看作是针对个人的行为，因为这势必会增强内阻力。编辑不是敌人，评论者也不是敌人。内阻力才是敌人。战争发生在我们自己的大脑中。我们不能让外界的批评——哪怕它说得都对——来强化我们内部的敌人。那个敌人已经足够强大了。

A professional schools herself to stand apart from her performance, even as she gives herself to it heart and soul. The *Bhagavad-Gita* tells us we have a right only to our labor, not to the fruits of our labor. All the warrior can give is his life; all the athlete can do is leave everything on the field.

职业选手告诫自己，要与作品保持距离，哪怕那是他们心血的结晶。《薄伽梵歌》告诉我们，我们只有劳动的权利，没有要求劳动果实的权利。勇士所能付出的只有生命；运动员所能做的只是将一切都留在竞技场上。

The professional loves her work. She is invested in it wholeheartedly. But she does not forget that the work is not her. Her artistic self contains many works and many performances. Already the next is percolating inside her. The next will be better, and the one after that better still.

职业选手热爱工作，会全身心地投入其中。但他们时刻记得，工作不等于他们自身。他们的艺术自我里包含着许多作品和许多表演。下一个作品已经开始在他们心中酝酿。下一个会更好，再下一个会比下一个更好。

The professional self-validates. She is tough-minded. In the face of indifference or adulation, she assesses her stuff coldly and objectively. Where it fell short, she'll improve it. Where it triumphed, she'll make it better still. She'll work harder. She'll be back tomorrow.

职业选手选择自我认证。他们意志坚强。无论面对冷漠还是吹捧，他们都能冷静、客观地评估自己的作品。不够好的地方，下次改进。好的地方，再接再厉，下次要做得更好。他们会更加努力。明天，他们还会回来。

The professional gives an ear to criticism, seeking to learn and grow. But she never forgets that Resistance is using criticism against her on a far more diabolical level. Resistance enlists criticism to reinforce the fifth column of fear already at work inside the artist's head, seeking to break her will and crack her dedication. The professional does not fall for this. Her resolution, before all others, remains: No matter what, I will never let Resistance beat me.

职业选手倾听批评，从中学习、成长。但他们从未忘记，内阻力也会利用批评，从更加恶劣的层面上打击他们。内阻力征集批评，来为早已暗藏在艺术家头脑中的“第五纵队”[^*]。恐惧输送给养，试图摧毁他们的意志，打破他们的奉献精神。职业选手不会上当。他们决心坚定，超越了一切：无论怎样，绝不让内阻力击垮我。

## A PROFESSIONAL ENDURES ADVERSITY

I had been in Tinseltown five years, had finished nine screenplays on spec, none of which had sold. Finally I got a meeting with a big producer. He kept taking phone calls, even as I pitched my stuff. He had one of those headset things, so he didn't even have to pick up a receiver; the calls came in and he took them. Finally one came that was personal. "Would you mind?" he asked, indicating the door. "I need some privacy on this one." I exited. The door closed behind me. Ten minutes passed. I was standing out by the secretaries. Twenty more minutes passed. Finally the producer's door opened; he came out pulling on his jacket. "Oh, I'm so sorry!"

我在浮华城[^**]待了五年，试着写了九部电影剧本，没有一部能卖出去。最后，我终于有了和一位大制作人见面的机会。他一直在接电话，哪怕在我讲剧本的时候也没停下。他挂着那种耳机，甚至不用拿起听筒。有电话进来他就接。直到接到一个私人电话。“你介意吗？”他指着门问道，“我需要一些私人空间来接这个电话。”我退了出去。门在我身后关上了。十分钟过去。我站在门外秘书们的办公桌旁。又是二十分钟过去了。终于，制作人的房门打开了。他一边穿外套，一边往外走。“哦，实在是抱歉！”

He had forgotten all about me.

他把我忘得一干二净。

I'm human. This hurt. I wasn't a kid either; I was in my forties, with a rap sheet of failure as long as your arm.

我也是一个人。这很伤人。但我不是年轻人了——那时的我已经四十多岁，有着一份摞起来将近半人高的失败前科档案。

The professional cannot let himself take humiliation personally. Humiliation, like rejection and criticism, is the external reflection of internal Resistance.

职业选手不能把羞辱归于个人。就像拒绝和批评一样，羞辱也是内阻力的外在反映。

The professional endures adversity. He lets the birdshit splash down on his slicker, remembering that it comes clean with a heavy-duty hosing. He himself, his creative center, cannot be buried, even beneath a mountain of guano. His core is bulletproof. Nothing can touch it unless he lets it.

职业选手能够忍耐逆境。他听任鸟粪溅落在他的油布雨衣上，心里知道，只要拎起水管，开大了水，就能冲洗干净。他自身才是他创作的核心，哪怕鸟粪堆成了山，他也不能被埋葬。他的内核是防弹的。除非他自己允许，否则任何东西都触碰不到它。

I saw a fat happy old guy once in his Cadillac on the freeway. He had the A/C going, Pointer Sisters on the CD, puffing on a stogie. His license plate:

有一次，我在高速公路上看到一个开凯迪拉克的胖老头很快活的样子。他开着空调，CD机里放着“指针姐妹”的歌，嘴里叼着一根廉价的雪茄在吞云吐雾。他的车牌上写着：

> DUES PD
>
> 应付款已付

The professional keeps his eye on the doughnut and not on the hole. He reminds himself it's better to be in the arena, getting stomped by the bull, than to be up in the stands or out in the parking lot.

职业选手会一直盯着甜甜圈，而不是中间的洞。他们会提醒自己，就算是在斗牛场上被公牛踩伤，也胜过站在看台上，或躲在停车场里。

## A PROFESSIONAL SELF-VALIDATES

An amateur lets the negative opinion of others unman him. He takes external criticism to heart, allowing it to trump his own belief in himself and his work. Resistance loves this.

业余爱好者会因为他人的负面意见而变得怯懦。他把外界的批评放在心上，让它压倒了对自己和工作的信念。内阻力喜欢这个。

Can you stand another Tiger Woods story? With four holes to go on the final day of the 2001 Masters (which Tiger went on to win, completing the all-four-majors-at-one-time Slam), some chucklehead in the gallery snapped a camera shutter at the top of Tiger's backswing. Incredibly, Tiger was able to pull up in mid-swing and back off the shot. But that wasn't the amazing part. After looking daggers at the malefactor, Tiger recomposed himself, stepped back to the ball, and striped it 310 down the middle.

想再听一个泰格·伍兹的故事吗？那是2001年的大师赛——泰格·伍兹最终赢下这场比赛，依靠连续夺得四项大满贯赛事冠军，达成了“老虎全满贯”——的最后一天，最后四个洞，观众席上有个笨蛋在泰格的球杆向后挥到最顶端时按下了相机快门。令人难以置信的是，泰格竟能在挥杆途中拉起球杆，没有击球。这还不是最惊人的部分。在犀利地瞥了那男人一眼之后，泰格重新调整好状态，回到球前，打出了310码，直落中场。

That's a professional. It is tough-mindedness at a level most of us can't comprehend, let alone emulate. But let's look more closely at what Tiger did, or rather what he didn't do.

这就是职业选手。这是一种我们大多数人都无法理解，更谈不上效仿的强大内心。不过，不妨让我们仔细看看“老虎”伍兹究竟做了什么，更确切地说，是他没有做什么。

First, he didn't react reflexively. He didn't allow an act that by all rights should have provoked an automatic response of rage to actually produce that rage. He controlled his reaction. He governed his emotion.

第一，他没有让本能主导反应。他没有允许这种按理说会天然地激起愤怒的行为导出其愤怒。他控制住了自己的反应。掌控了自己的情绪。

Second, he didn't take it personally. He could have perceived this shutterbug's act as a deliberate blow aimed at him individually, with the intention of throwing him off his shot. He could have reacted with outrage or indignation or cast himself as a victim. He didn't.

第二，他没有把这件事放在心上。他可以将这位摄影爱好者的行为视为针对他个人的蓄意攻击，认为这就是为了毁掉他的击球。他可以恼火、愤怒，或是把自己塑造成受害者。但他没有。

Third, he didn't take it as a sign of heaven's malevolence. He could have experienced this bolt as the malice of the golfing gods, like a bad hop in baseball or a linesman's miscall in tennis. He could have groaned or sulked or surrendered mentally to this injustice, this interference, and used it as an excuse to fail. He didn't.

第三，他不认为这是上天的恶意。他可以将这次意外视为高尔夫之神的恶意，就像棒球场上一个糟糕的反弹球或网球比赛中边裁的一次失误。他原本可以为这种不公、这种干扰而抱怨、生气，或在精神上屈服，把它当作失败的借口。但他没有。

What he did do was maintain his sovereignty over the moment. He understood that, no matter what blow had befallen him from an outside agency, he himself still had his job to do, the shot he needed to hit right here, right now. And he knew that it remained within his power to produce that shot. Nothing stood in his way except whatever emotional upset he himself chose to hold on to. Tiger's mother, Kultida, is a Buddhist. Perhaps from her he had learned compassion, to let go of fury at the heedlessness of an overzealous shutter- clicker. In any event Tiger Woods, the ultimate professional, vented his anger quickly with a look, then recomposed himself and returned to the task at hand.

伍兹所做的是，保持对这一时刻的掌控权。他明白，无论外部对他送来了怎样的阻碍，他始终有自己的工作要做，此时此刻，他要做的就是好好击出这一球。他知道，他仍然有能力打出这一击。除非他自己选择纠缠于情绪化的不安，否则就没有什么能阻挡他。泰格·伍兹的母亲库提达是一名佛教徒。或许，他是在母亲身上学会了慈悲同情，让他能放下愤怒，原谅这样一个过分热情的“快门手”的疏忽。总而言之，终极职业选手泰格·伍兹只用一瞥便迅速纾解了愤怒，随即重新调整状态，回到了眼前的任务中。

The professional cannot allow the actions of others to define his reality. Tomorrow morning the critic will be gone, but the writer will still be there facing the blank page. Nothing matters but that he keep working. Short of a family crisis or the outbreak of World War III, the professional shows up, ready to serve the gods.

职业选手不能允许用他人的行为来定义自己的现实。明天早上，评论者就会离开，写作者却依然要面对新的空白页。除了坚持工作之外，什么都不重要。只要没有出现家庭危机，没有爆发第三次世界大战，职业选手就会继续出现，随时准备为众神服务。

Remember, Resistance wants us to cede sovereignty to others. It wants us to stake our self-worth, our identity, our reason-for-being, on the response of others to our work. Resistance knows we can't take this. No one can.

记住，内阻力巴不得我们把掌控权让渡出去。它希望我们将我们的自我价值、身份、我们存在的理由都建筑在他人对我们工作的反应之上。内阻力知道，我们承受不了这个。没人承受得了。

The professional blows critics off. He doesn't even hear them. Critics, he reminds himself, are the unwitting mouthpieces of Resistance and as such can be truly cunning and pernicious. They can articulate in their reviews the same toxic venom that Resistance itself concocts inside our heads. That is their real evil. Not that we believe them, but that we believe the Resistance in our own minds, for which critics serve as unconscious spokespersons.

职业选手对评论者不屑一顾。甚至听不见他们的声音。他会提醒自己，评论者是内阻力的不自知的喉舌，因此可能是真正狡猾和有害的。他们可能在评论中灌注毒液，就是那种内阻力早已在我们自己的头脑中调制出的毒液。这是他们真正的罪恶。我们相信的并不是他们，而是我们自己心中的内阻力，就此而言，评论者也不过是内阻力的不知情的代言人。

The professional learns to recognize envy-driven criticism and to take it for what it is: the supreme compliment. The critic hates most that which he would have done himself if he had had the guts.

职业选手学会了识别因嫉妒而生的批评，并将其视为最高的赞美。评论者最痛恨的无非一点，如果有足够的勇气，他本可以自己上场做那些事情。

## A PROFESSIONAL RECOGNIZES HER LIMITATIONS

She gets an agent, she gets a lawyer, she gets an accountant. She knows she can only be a professional at one thing. She brings in other pros and treats them with respect.

职业选手有经纪人，有律师，有会计师。她知道，自己只能在一件事上成为职业选手。于是引入其他的职业选手，尊重他们的专业。

## A PROFESSIONAL REINVENTS HIMSELF

Goldie Hawn once observed that there are only three ages for an actress in Hollywood: "Babe, D.A., and Driving Miss Daisy." She was making a different point, but the truth remains: As artists we serve the Muse, and the Muse may have more than one job for us over our lifetime.

高迪·霍恩曾经观察到，在好莱坞，女演员只有三个年龄段：“甜心，地方检察官，《为黛西小姐开车》。”她提出的是一个不同的观点，但真相依旧不变：作为艺术家，我们为缪斯服务，而缪斯需要我们在一生中完成的工作可能并不止一种。

The professional does not permit himself to become hidebound within one incarnation, however comfortable or successful. Like a transmigrating soul, he shucks his outworn body and dons a new one. He continues his journey.

职业选手不会允许自己墨守一个状态，无论多么舒适或成功。就像转世的灵魂，抛开旧的身体，换上新的。然后继续他的旅程。

## A PROFESSIONAL IS RECOGNIZED BY OTHER PROFESSIONALS

The professional senses who has served his time and who hasn't. Like Alan Ladd and Jack Palance circling each other in *Shane*, a gun recognizes another gun.

职业选手能感觉到谁付出了时间，谁没有。就像艾伦·拉德和杰克·帕拉斯在《原野奇侠》里相互绕圈一样，一把枪能认出另一把枪。

## YOU, INC.

When I first moved to Los Angeles and made the acquaintance of working screenwriters, I learned that many had their own corporations. They provided their writing services not as themselves but as "loan-outs" from their one- man businesses. Their writing contracts were f/s/o — "for services of " — themselves. I had never seen this before. I thought it was pretty cool.

第一次搬到洛杉矶时，我认识了一些在职编剧，了解到许多人都有他们自己的公司。他们不是以个人的身份提供写作服务，而是作为那个一人公司的“借调”人员出场。他们的写作合同都是f/s/o（for services of）——“服务于”他们自己。我以前从未见过这种事情。感觉这样很酷。

For a writer to incorporate himself has certain tax and financial advantages. But what I love about it is the metaphor. I like the idea of being Myself, Inc. That way I can wear two hats. I can hire myself and fire myself. I can even, as Robin Williams once remarked of writer-producers, blow smoke up my own ass.

对于写作者来说，把自己纳入公司有一定的税收和财务优势。但我爱的是其中的隐喻。我喜欢这个想法，我可以是“我自己”股份有限公司。这样我就有了两顶帽子。我可以雇佣自己，也可以解雇自己。我甚至可以大肆吹嘘自己，就像罗宾·威廉姆斯曾经谈到的那些剧作家兼制片人一样。

Making yourself a corporation (or just thinking of yourself in that way) reinforces the idea of professionalism because it separates the artist-doing-the-work from the will-and- consciousness-running-the-show. No matter how much abuse is heaped on the head of the former, the latter takes it in stride and keeps on trucking. Conversely with success: You-the-writer may get a swelled head, but you-the-boss remember how to take yourself down a peg.

让自己成为一家公司（或者只是这样看待自己）可以强化职业精神，因为它将创作具体作品的艺术家和凭借着意愿、意志操持事业的艺术家分开了。无论前者的头上落下多少辱骂，后者都可以泰然处之，继续工作。反之，面对成功时，身为写作者的你可能会头脑发热，但作为老板的你总会记得，如何让自己收敛一点。

Have you ever worked in an office? Then you know about Monday morning status meetings. The group assembles in the conference room and the boss goes over what assignments each team member is responsible for in the coming week. When the meeting breaks up, an assistant prepares a work sheet and distributes it. When this hits your desk an hour later, you know exactly what you have to do that week.

你曾在办公室里工作过吗？那就该知道周一早上的每周例会。小组成员在会议室集合，老板审核接下来一周里每个团队成员要负责的任务。等到会议结束，助理会整理好工作表，分发给大家。一小时后，当这份工作表出现在你的办公桌上时，你就会清楚地知道这一周该做些什么了。

I have one of those meetings with myself every Monday. I sit down and go over my assignments. Then I type it up and distribute it to myself.

我每周一都会和自己开一次这样的会议。我坐下来，检查我的工作任务。然后把它打出来，发给自己。

I have corporate stationery and corporate business cards and a corporate checkbook. I write off corporate expenses and pay corporate taxes. I have different credit cards for myself and my corporation.

我有公司文具、公司名片和公司支票簿。我核销公司开支，缴纳公司营业税。我为自己和公司准备了不同的信用卡。

If we think of ourselves as a corporation, it gives us a healthy distance on ourselves. We're less subjective. We don't take blows as personally. We're more cold-blooded; we can price our wares more realistically. Sometimes, as Joe Blow himself, I'm too mild-mannered to go out and sell. But as Joe Blow, Inc., I can pimp the hell out of myself. I'm not me anymore. I'm Me, Inc.

如果我们把自己视为一家公司，就能在我们和我们自己之间留出一段健康的缓冲距离。我们会不那么主观。不把打击归结于个人。我们可以更冷血；也可以更现实地为我们产出的商品定价。有时候，作为某某某本人，我太好说话，以至于不好意思走出去推销。但作为某某某股份有限公司，我甚至能为自己拉皮条。我不再是我了。我是“我”股份有限公司。

I'm a pro.

我是职业选手。

## A CRITTER THAT KEEPS COMING

Why does Resistance yield to our turning pro? Because Resistance is a bully. Resistance has no strength of its own; its power derives entirely from our fear of it. A bully will back down before the runtiest twerp who stands his ground.

为什么当我们成为职业选手时，内阻力会屈服？因为内阻力是个仗势欺人的家伙。内阻力本身没有力量，它的力量完全来源于我们对它的恐惧。哪怕是最弱小的笨蛋，只要能够坚持立场，仗势欺人者也会退缩。

The essence of professionalism is the focus upon the work and its demands, while we are doing it, to the exclusion of all else. The ancient Spartans schooled themselves to regard the enemy, any enemy, as nameless and faceless. In other words, they believed that if they did their work, no force on earth could stand against them. In *The Searchers*, John Wayne and Jeffrey Hunter pursue the war chief, Scar, who has kidnapped their young kinswoman, played by Natalie Wood. Winter stops them, but Wayne's character, Ethan Edwards, does not slacken his resolve. He'll return to the trail in spring, he declares, and, sooner or later, the fugitive's vigilance will slacken.

职业精神的本质在于：当我们工作时，只专注于工作和工作的相关需求，不计其余。古代斯巴达人训练自己将敌人一概视为没有姓名、没有面貌的对象，不理会对方是谁。换言之，他们相信，只要做了自己应做的工作，在这个地球上就没有任何力量能够与之对抗。在《搜索者》中，约翰·韦恩和杰弗里·亨特分别饰演伊森·爱德华兹和侄子马丁，两人追踪挑起战争的部落首领斯卡尔，因为斯卡尔绑架了他们的亲人，由娜塔莉·伍德饰演的“侄女”。冬天阻碍了他们，但伊森的决心并不曾因此消减。他宣布，自己会在春天回来，继续追踪——早晚有一天，逃跑的人会放松警惕。

> **ETHAN**
>
> Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on. So we'll find 'em in the end, I promise you that. Just as sure as the turning of the earth.
>
> 他似乎从来没有意识到有一种东西叫“穷追不舍”。所以，我们终究会找到他们的，我向你保证。就像保证地球会继续转动一样。

The pro keeps coming on. He beats Resistance at its own game by being even more resolute and even more implacable than it is.

职业选手穷追不舍。他比内阻力还要坚决，还要不依不饶，并在内阻力的游戏里将它打败。

## NO MYSTERY

There's no mystery to turning pro. It's a decision brought about by an act of will. We make up our minds to view ourselves as pros and we do it. Simple as that.

成为职业选手并不神秘。这是一个由意愿主导而做出的决定。我们下定决心把自己视为职业选手，并付诸行动。就这么简单。
