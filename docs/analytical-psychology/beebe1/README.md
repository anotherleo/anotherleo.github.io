# 类型与原型

在这个世界上，人们对意识知之甚少。中国人使用一个非常古老的词来形容我们解释现实时的智慧，这个词就是德，把德带入到与现实的关系中，就是道德，但是只有极少数中国古代先贤能够理解德是道的现实载体。直到 20 世纪的前十五年，人们才对意识的构成有了更深层的区分，这项工作源自瑞士精神病学家荣格开创的新科学，即分析心理学。荣格在自己的标志性著作《心理类型》一书中的第十章概述了每一种意识类型，荣格的类型并不是对人进行分类，而是对意识进行分类。在应理查德·卫礼贤之邀为他的书写评论时，荣格提出意识的类型就是金花的花瓣。这个评论让荣格对自己的发现有了最明确的构思，即意识不属于努力适应现实的自我，也不是被用来去打败无意识的，而是让一个展现出来的自我寻找到实现客体心灵潜能的方式。

我们有责任对荣格的观点进行再思考，在新世纪，在把这些内容重新呈献给中国人时，我们要对荣格观点的佛家、儒家和道家内容进行反思，本书中的论文皆是我数十年来应用荣格的理论进行实践探索的结果。荣格详细列举出八种智慧，我试图通过这些论文找到能够呈现出这八种智慧在现代人身上的表现方式。因此，本书的每一章都是在讲述一个如何能够成为有智慧之人的故事。最后，感谢本书的译者周党伟把这本书的内容呈现给中国的读者们。
