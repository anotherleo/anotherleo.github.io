# PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES: An historical overview

## Introduction

It has not always been clear to students of Jung’s analytical psychology what his famous ‘types’ are types of. The commonest assumption has been that they refer to types of people. But for Jung, they were types of consciousness, that is, characteristic orientations assumed by the ego in establishing and discriminating an individual’s inner and outer reality. For psychotherapists, an understanding of these different natural cognitive stances can be invaluable in the daily work of supporting the basic strengths of their clients’ personalities and of helping a particular consciousness to recognize its inherent limitations. The understanding of individual differences communicated on the basis of this theory can reduce a client’s shame at areas of relative ego weakness and diminish the client’s need to buttress the ego with strong defenses that complicate treatment.

对于大多数学习荣格分析心理学的学生而言，他们并非都清楚荣格著名的“类型”是指什么的类型，最常见的看法是认为这是指“人的类型”。但其实，荣格指的是 “**意识的类型**”，也即自我在建立和区分个体内在和外在现实时所使用的性格取向。对于心理治疗师而言，能理解这些不同的先天认知取向，对日常工作的价值不可估量。这有利于支持来访者基本的人格优势和协助一个特定的意识去认识自身固有的局限。基于这一理论所传达出的对个体差异的理解能够**降低来访者对自身弱点的羞耻感**，也能够减少来访者依赖强大的防御来支撑自我——这种防御往往使治疗变得复杂。

## Jung’s position on psychological types

Ever since his landmark self-defining text, Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (1912), it had been Jung’s understanding that the movements of the psyche observable in analysis tend toward consciousness. He had already recognized that consciousness is not expressed uniformly in the same way in every person. Rather, Jung conceptualized consciousness as centered in an ego that expressed its ability to orient the psyche through different basic attitudes and functions.

自从荣格出版自己的标志性著作《力比多的原型与转化》（1912）之后，他发现在分析中可以观察到心灵活动的方向朝向意识，他还发现意识在每一个人身上的表达方式也不同。因此，荣格将**意识**定义为：**能够通过不同的基本态度和功能主导心灵的自我的中心**。

Jung arrived at the germ of this point of view in the midst of his studies on word association, undertaken at the Burghölzli Mental Hospital beginning about 1902. In “The association of normal subjects,” written with Franz Riklin, Jung describes how the associations produced in the subjects by calling out a series of 400 different stimulus-words can be shown to be affected by unconscious complexes. But even in this earliest research. Jung recognized that “one principal factor is the individual character.” He and Riklin wrote: “From our experiments two easily recognizable types emerge: (1) A type in whose reactions subjective, often feeling-toned experiences are used. (2) A type whose reactions show an objective, impersonal tone” (Jung, 1904/1973, ¶412).

1902 年伊始，荣格在伯格霍利茨精神病医院进行词语联想测验研究，在此期间，他的这个观点开始萌芽。在一篇他和弗朗兹·瑞克林（Franz Riklin）合写的文章《正常被试的联想实验》中，荣格描述了被试对呈献出的 400 个不同刺激词进行联想，联想结果受到无意识情结的影响。但即使在这个最早的研究中，荣格也发现“一个主要因素就是个体的性格”，他和瑞克林写道：

> 从我们的实验来看，可以看到两种容易识别的类型：1. 一种类型的反应是主观的，通常会使用情感经验。2. 另一种类型的反应是客观的、非个人化的。

As late as September 1913, in a lecture delivered to the Psychoanalytic Congress in Munich, Jung, now turning his attention to the psychopathology observed in clinical work, still noted two basic types of “relations to the object” (and the self), that of the “hysteric,” whose “centrifugal” extraversion “displays as a rule an intensity of feeling that surpasses the normal,” and that of the “schizophrenic,” in whom, on account of a “centripetal” introversion, “the normal level is not reached at all” (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶858).[1](part0023.xhtml#IvK3oXOfSouYfENtHegYLQ2566) This added another dimension beyond presence of complexes to the problem of analyzing the subjectivity of consciousness, a problem that other observational sciences, including experimental psychology, had already recognized as ‘the personal equation,’ a term Jung now adopted to describe his developing area of study (Shamdasani, 2003, pp. 30–31).

1913 年 9 月末，在慕尼黑精神分析大会上做报告时，荣格把注意力转向了临床工作中观察到的精神病理学，他观察到两种“客体关系”的类型：一种是“歇斯底里式的”，它“离心式的”外倾，“表现为一种超出了正常的情感紧张”；另一种是“精神分裂式的”，在这种人身上，由于“向心式的”内倾，“根本无法达到正常水平”[^1]。除情结之外，荣格加入了一个新的维度来分析意识的主观性问题，其它观测科学，包括实验心理学在内也发现了这一问题并将其称为“人差”，荣格现在借用这个术语来描述他研究领域中的现象。

In the next seven years, in conversation with others in the newly formed Zurich School of Analytical Psychology, he began to unpack his typological theory. The correspondence with Hans Schmid-Guisan (Jung & Schmid-Guisan, 2013) was particularly helpful in getting Jung to reconsider his preliminary equation of feeling with extraversion and thinking with introversion. Another early member of the Zurich School Maria Moltzer, in a lecture to the Psychological Club in Zurich in June 1916, proposed intuition as a third type of consciousness (Shamdasani, 1999). Her suggestion as well as Jung’s own increasing awareness that sensation was more than an “organ function . . . subordinate to feeling” as he had thought in 1915 (Jung & Schmid-Guisan, 2013, p. 136) made him aware that beyond extraversion–introversion and thinking–feeling, which so far organized the psyche along strictly rational grounds, there was another axis of orientation altogether that his theory would need to take into account, the “irrational” axis of sensation–intuition. (Jung himself seems to have recognized that the difference between his original thinking–feeling axis and the new sensation–intuition axis was that the first pair of functions are deployed in a rational way to interpret experience, whereas the latter merely apprehend what is already given to us by the outer or inner world, and hence do not rely on optional processes of cognition or evaluation: see Marshall, 1968.) During the years he was engaged with the active imaginations he recorded in his Red Book, Jung discovered how many different figures occupied his inner psychological space, each with consciousnesses distinctly their own. He came to see the types as so many standpoints, each with their own strengths and blind spots. A painting he made in 1921 (Jung 2009, plate 127 & p. 307 n240) has been interpreted by Frey (2012) to convey how the types were for Jung ways of sacrificing oneself to experience by those who submit to it consciously. That consciousness requires the experience of viewpoints that oppose and challenge one’s own is also conveyed by the cruciate diagram he soon came to use (cf. Jung, 1989/2012, p. 97) to show the range of the functions and the degree of their oppositions to each other. Jung’s theory had certainly undergone considerable modification after 1913 as he became more aware of the complexity of consciousness. By the time he came to write Psychological Types in 1919 and 1920, he had already envisioned a sophisticated system of analysis of types of consciousness as mental processes characterized by four main dichotomies: extraversion–introversion, thinking–feeling, sensation–intuition and rational–irrational. It was this system that he continued to defend for the rest of his life and that has informed all subsequent work on Jung’s psychological types.

在接下来的七年中，在汉斯·施密德·吉桑（Hans Schmid-Guisan）和托尼·伍尔夫（Toni Wolff）的帮助下，荣格开始了他的类型理论的研究。尤其是他和汉斯·施密德·吉桑的通信帮助他去检视和弄清楚外倾情感和内倾思维的原始差异；他的亲密助手托尼·伍尔夫让他意识到，除了“外倾 - 内倾”和“思维 - 情感” （它们用严格的理性原则组织心灵）的差异，还存在另外一条取向的轴，即非理性的“感觉 - 直觉”轴，这也是他的理论应当考虑到的。（荣格自己似乎也认识到他理论中原有的“思维 - 情感”轴和托尼·伍尔夫所说的 “感觉 - 直觉”轴之间存在差异，“思维 - 情感”功能使用一种理性的方式去解释经验，而 “感觉 - 直觉”功能仅仅是去理解外在或内在世界已经给我们提供了什么，但并不使用任何需要作出选择的认知和评估过程。）到 1919 年和 1920年荣格开始写《心理类型》时，他已经形成了一套由四个主要的对立轴形成的成熟系统：外倾 - 内倾，思维 - 情感，感觉 - 直觉，理性 - 非理性。此后，他都在不断地完善这个系统，并且，在他接下来的作品中也都带有了心理类型色彩。

## Definitions

In Psychological Types, Jung understands there to be four functions of consciousness, which he names sensation, thinking, feeling and intuition. These terms did not originate with Jung; rather, they were culled from the history of psychology, and they carry the ghost of earlier meanings placed on them by many physicians and philosophers, e.g. Hippocrates’ four temperaments: Melancholic, Sanguine, Choleric and Phlegmatic. Jung’s theory of psychological types resembles in some ways the eighteenth-century faculty psychology developed by theorists such as Christian Wolff (Richards, 1980), Franz Josef Gall (1835), and Thomas Reid (Brooks, 1976), according to which the mind consists of various powers or capacities, called faculties. One of these faculties had been willing, which became for Schopenhauer (1819/1909) the essential attribute of the unconscious mind. Freud (1899/2010, pp. 111–131) and Adler (1906 lecture to the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society (Nunberg & Federn, 1962, p. 42) ) would develop this theme in their theories of wishing and overcompensation. Their idea of the ego was an agency that needed to defend itself against knowing too much about the willing of the unconscious mind, and whose faculties could therefore best be described as defenses, even if those defenses enabled the psyche to pursue its true aims in disguise, as it were.

在《心理类型》一书中，荣格提出四种意识功能——感觉、思维、情感和直觉。这些术语并不是荣格创造的，而是来自于心理学的历史，它们都带有一点早先生理学家和哲学家赋予的意义。例如，希波克拉底（Hippocrate）的四种气质类型：胆汁质、多血质、粘液质和抑郁质。荣格的心理类型理论在某种程度上和 18 世纪克里斯汀安·冯·伍尔夫（Christian Von Wolff）以及托马斯·里德（Tomas Tied）发展出来的“机能心理学”类似，他们认为心灵由各种能量或能力构成，称为机能。其中一种机能成为了意志，而意志是叔本华对无意识心理的主要贡献。弗洛伊德（Freud）和阿德勒（Adler）在他们的愿望实现和过度补偿理论中发展了这一主题，他们的思想认为自我是一个中介，不让自己知道过多来自无意识心理意志的信息。因此，对自我的机能最恰当的描述是防御，即使这些防御好像促使心灵使用伪装的方式去达到真正的目的。

Jung, consistent with his greater emphasis on the possibilities of consciousness, accepted the will as part of the ego (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶844), and concentrated on the functions the ego needs to orient itself to any reality with which it must cope. To understand reality, he reasoned, we need a function of consciousness that registers reality as real: this he called the sensation function, which delivers to us the sensation that something is (Jung, 1968, p. 11). Then, he said, we need a function to define for us what we are perceiving when we notice that something is there: this he called the thinking function. Next, he understood that we need a function that assigns a value to the thing that we have perceived and named; this is called the function of feeling.[2](part0023.xhtml#IvK3oXOfSouYfENtHegYLQ2872) Finally, he realized that we require a function to enable us to divine the implications or possibilities of the thing that has been empirically perceived, logically defined and discriminatingly evaluated: this he called the intuitive function.

荣格更加强调意识的多种可能性，于此同时，他认为意识是自我的一部分，专注于研究自我的功能如何调整自己以应对它必须去应对的任何现实。荣格认为，要理解现实，我们就需要一个功能去如实地记录现实，他称之为“感觉功能”，这个功能传递给我们的信息是“感觉到的是什么”。然后，他说，当我们注意到某个东西，需要一个功能去定义我们感知到的内容，这就是“思维功能”。接着，他看到我们需要一个功能去为我们感知到或者命名的东西赋予价值，这就是 “情感功能”[^2]。最后他意识到，对于已经被我们经验性地感知到、逻辑性地定义过和有区别地评价过的事物，我们需要一个功能让我们能够预测这些事物的隐含之意和可能性，这就是他所称的“直觉功能”。

Jung found it easier to define the first three functions than the fourth. On one occasion, he said,

> Sensation tells us that a thing is. Thinking tells us what the thing is, feeling tells us what it is worth to us. Now what else could there be? One would assume one has a complete picture of the world when one knows there is something, what it is, and what it is worth [original italics].

He added immediately:

> But there is another category, and that is time. Things have a past and they have a future. They come from somewhere, they go to somewhere, and you cannot see where they came from and you cannot know where they go to, but you get what the Americans call a hunch.

Jung, 1968, p. 13

That ability to get, and to a certain degree to trust, the hunch is what Jung meant by intuition. That he understood what it means to trust this essentially irrational process of perception is part of Jung’s appeal to people who are naturally disposed to use their intuition to orient themselves to reality.

荣格发现，定义前三种功能比第四种功能容易。有一次，他说：“感觉告诉我们这有一个东西，思维告诉我们这个东西是什么，情感告我们这个东西有什么用。那么现在还剩下什么呢？有人可能会觉得知道了有一个东西，它是什么，有什么价值，这已经对世界有了一个完整的认识。”他立刻补充道：“但是还有另外一个范畴，那就是时间。事物都有过去和未来，它们来自某处，又去向某处，但是你不知道它们来自哪里，也不知它们要去哪里，你通过美国人所称的第六感获取这些信息。”获取第六感并在某种程度上信任第六感的能力就是荣格所说的直觉。对于那些天生倾向于使用直觉来调整自身应对现实的人，荣格认为信任这种不可或缺的非理性感知过程是十分重要的。

Jung held that feeling and thinking are rational functions, and that sensation and intuition are irrational functions. He did not sustain the faculty psychologists’ opposition between reason and passion. Jung understood ‘feeling’ as a rational process, that is, as neither affect (or what we sometime call ‘feelings’) nor the result of more unconscious emotion-based processes, even though he admitted our complexes are ‘feeling-toned.’ Rather, Jung made clear that he took the process of assigning feeling value to be an ego-function that was just as rational in its operation as the process of defining and creating logical links (thinking).

荣格认为情感和思维是理性功能，感觉和直觉是非理性功能，但他并不认同机能心理学家所说的理性和激情之间的对立。也就是说，荣格把“情感”理解为理性过程，它不同于感情（affect），也不是基于情绪的更加无意识的过程，即使他承认我们的情结是“情感基调”的。但是，荣格明确表示赋予情感价值的过程就是一种自我功能，它与定义和创立逻辑连接的思维过程一样通过理性来运作。

Jung also recognized that sensation, even though it is the evidential basis for our empirical reality testing, is as irrational a process as the intuitive one that delivers our ‘hunches’ to us. As a moment’s reflection will demonstrate, we do not rationally choose what we manage to see, hear, smell, taste or grasp with our sense of touch. By linking feeling with thinking as rational functions, and sensation with intuition as irrational functions of consciousness, Jung broke with the nineteenth-century habit of lumping feeling with intuition as marking a ‘romantic’ temperament and thinking with sensation as the unmistakable signs of a ‘practical’ disposition. Rather, in Psychological Types, he convincingly makes the case that consciousness is for all of us the product of both rational and irrational processes of encountering and assessing reality.

荣格还认为，就像直觉把我们的第六感传递给我们一样，感觉是一个非理性过程，即使它很明显是我们对经验现实进行检测的基础。回想一下就会发现，我们并不会理性地去选择我们看到的、听到的、尝到的和抓到的。通过把情感和思维归为意识的理性功能，感觉和直觉归为意识的非理性功能，荣格摆脱了19 世纪的传统——把情感和直觉一并称作一种“浪漫”气质，把思维和感觉一并误认为是“务实”性格的标志。在《心理类型》中，他很明确地指出对于我们所有人而言，意识是面对和评估现实时理性和非理性过程的共同产物。

The concept of introversion was by now fully liberated from its earlier confusion in Jung’s writings with both thinking and objectivity, just as extraversion was freed from its former fixed association with feeling and subjectivity. In Psychological Types, Jung states that:

> The extravert is distinguished by his craving for the object, by his empathy and identification with the object, his voluntary dependence on the object. He is influenced by the object in the same degree as he strives to assimilate it.
>
> Jung, 1921/1971, ¶535

By contrast,

> the introvert is distinguished by his self-assertion vis à vis the object. He struggles against any dependence on the object, he repels all its influences, and even fears it. So much the more is he dependent on the idea, which shields him from external reality and gives him the feeling of inner freedom—though he pays for this with a very noticeable power psychology.
>
> Jung, 1921/1971, ¶535

荣格使用思维和客观性所写的著作使内倾概念已经完全从早期的混乱中解放出来，就像外倾也从之前带有情感和主观性的固定联结中解放出来一样。在《心理类型》中，荣格写道：

> 外倾的特点是他渴求客体，对客体共情和认同，自愿地依赖客体，他被客体影响的程度和他努力同化客体的程度相当。（荣格，1971：317）
>
> 内倾的显著特征是一意孤行地与客体对立。他与任何对客体的依赖作斗争，他拒绝客体的任何影响，甚至有些害怕它，所以他会越发依赖观念，这些观念使他摆脱外在现实并获得内在的自由感。（荣格，1971：317-318）

Jung’s use of personification here—his reference to the introvert and the extravert—needs some deconstruction. Read literally, as too many have read him, he seems to be saying that introversion—the “inward-turning of libido” (¶769)—and extraversion—the “outward-turning of libido” (¶710)—characterize different kinds of people. Elsewhere in the book Psychological Types he implies that we all use both processes, that there is an extravert and an introvert in each of us. How this can be finally becomes clear when he uses the now famous terms not as nouns but as adjectives, to define the way in which the various functions of consciousness happen to be deployed in a particular individual. In turn, he takes up the description of extraverted thinking, extraverted feeling, extraverted sensation, extraverted intuition, introverted thinking, introverted feeling, introverted sensation and introverted intuition, noting that these “basic psychological functions seldom or never have the same strength or degree of development in the same individual” and that as “a rule, one or the other function predominates, in both strength and development” (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶584). The implication, however, is that all eight of these distinct cognitive processes exist, at least to some degree, in every one of us. The origins of what is nowadays called “the whole-type eight-function model” of personality (Geldart, 1998; Clark, 2000; Haas, McAlpine, & Hartzler, 2001) are therefore plainly laid out in Psychological Types.

What Jung means by the introverted use of a function comes across in his personified notion of someone “dependent upon the idea.” He explains that he employs the term idea “to express the meaning of a primordial image” (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶732), that is to say, an archetype. An introverted function, therefore, is one that has turned away from the object and toward the archetypal ‘idea’ that the object might be most closely matched to. This archetypal idea, residing in the inner world, can be understood as a profound thought, a value, a metaphorical image, or a model of reality, depending upon whether the introverted function is thinking, feeling, intuition or sensation. When an introverted function is used to orient to something external, it is in the end the comparison to the archetype, not the stimulating object or situation itself, that finally commands the attention of the function. This can seem like a withdrawal from the object.

Introverted sensation, as a process, is thus “guided by the intensity of the subjective sensation excited by the objective stimulus” (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶650). That means that the person strongly identified with the use of this function will react immediately to the internal, bodily sensations caused by, for example, the food served at a meal, so that the distension of his stomach, or the degree of pepper in the meal, even the audibility of others at his table, may turn out to be more determinative of his happiness at a dinner party than the carefully assembled company that the host or hostess has arranged for the gathering. This is because a dissonance with the archetype of the good meal has been constellated by the excessive stimulation. This process is not usually visible. When someone has been using the introverted sensation function primarily,

seen from the outside, it looks as though the effect of the object did not penetrate into the subject at all. This impression is correct inasmuch as a subjective content does, in fact, intervene from the unconscious and intercept the effect of the object. The intervention may be so abrupt that the individual appears to be shielding himself directly from all objective influences.

Jung, 1921/1971, ¶651

Introverted sensation, of course, can be just as guided by a visual cue: the films of Alfred Hitchcock, who used this function cinematically in a dominant way, dazzle us with the uncanny power of seemingly ordinary images to stimulate unexpected, archetypal reactions.

Those who make abundant use of an introverted function—introverted intuition, say, or introverted feeling—can nevertheless be perceived by others as depreciating the object. Jungian case studies sometimes seem, when introverted intuition is taking the lead, to leave the patient behind in a maze of mythological ‘amplifications.’ The poet Rilke, who seems to have known that his sensibility was masked by a strong introverted feeling, is said to have written to a new mistress, “I love you, but of course it’s none of your business” (von Franz, 1971/1998, p. 49).

A particularly difficult introverted function, from the standpoint of personal relations, is introverted thinking, because, when the object of introverted thinking is a person, “this person has a distinct feeling that he matters only in a negative way.” Often, “he feels himself warded off as something definitely disturbing” (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶633). The object, when this function is being used, is being avoided because the person using this function is “building up his world of ideas, and never shrinks from thinking a thought because it might prove to be dangerous, subversive, heretical, or wounding to other people’s feelings” (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶634). The ideas introverted thinking dwells on are archetypal ideas. These are notions that may either be sui generis or, if once cultural, long out of circulation, which nevertheless seem entirely appropriate to the exact definition of a situation at hand, since they fit it better than the currently accepted dictates of conventional extraverted thinking. These ‘new’ thoughts, however, take effort to explain and the introverted thinking function frequently goes on refining its conceptions when the patience of others has been exhausted: it does not know when to stop.

Introverted intuition, as a function, is concerned with “the background processes of consciousness,” and for the person using that function in a differentiated way, “unconscious images acquire the dignity of things” (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶657). This is the one type of consciousness that naturally “apprehends the images arising from the a priori inherited foundations of the unconscious.” That is, rather than thinking about, experientially comparing, or feeling the archetype that arises in relation to a situation, the introverted intuitive function becomes directly aware of the archetype as an image, as if ‘seeing’ it: introverted intuition is therefore the function responsible for visionary experience, which often seems ‘mystical’ to others.

Introverted feeling, by contrast, can only feel the archetypal image of a situation. It cannot see it. The hoary Indian story of the three blind men and the elephant takes on more meaning if one considers that India is a country where introverted feeling seems to predominate in collective consciousness. Thus, all of the blind men (there are as many as six in some versions, and sometimes they come from a city in which all of the inhabitants are blind) could be said to represent the introverted feeling function, literally feeling its way slowly around the archetype, the elephant in their midst. Necessarily, a thinking definition of that experience at any moment will be partial—“It’s a rope,” “It’s a snake,” “It’s a great mud wall”—but the process never ceases until the elephant is felt entirely. It is important to realize that, when the introverted feeling function is, for example, feeling ‘bad,’ it is feeling the entire archetypal category of ‘bad’ and is not likely to quit until that archetypal badness is felt through. As Jung says,

The depth of this feeling can only be guessed—it can never be clearly grasped. It makes people silent and difficult of access; it shrinks back like a violet from the brute nature of the object in order to fill the depths of the subject. It comes out with negative judgments or assumes an air of profound indifference as a means of defense.

Jung, 1921/1971, ¶638

Perhaps we all get into our introverted feeling when we are depressed. The important thing to grasp, in understanding introverted feeling, is that archetypes can be felt every bit as much as they can be thought about, directly intuited, or experienced somatically. As Jung puts it,

The primordial images are, of course, just as much ideas as feeling. Fundamental ideas, ideas like God, freedom, and immortality, are just as much feeling-values as they are significant ideas.

Jung, 1921/1971, ¶639

The extraverted functions, as Jung has already been quoted as informing us, tend so completely to merge with the object as to identify with it. They often end up without adequate distance from the stimuli that are presented to them. In the case of extraverted feeling, these are the feelings—that is, the emotions and prejudices—of others, and often of society at large, so that the personality of a person strongly identified with this function “appears adjusted in relation to external conditions. Her feelings harmonize with objective situations and general values” (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶597). The woman led by extraverted feeling in her “love choice,” Jung tells us, will see to it that “the ‘suitable’ man is loved, and no one else” (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶597). On the other hand, no type is more capable of appreciation and sympathy.

Similarly, extraverted thinking tends to become enamored of established ideas, frequently neglecting the duty to think freshly about what is being expressed and the language that is really appropriate to it. There is no brake, therefore, against insisting that these ideas should govern everyone’s behavior. As Jung puts it, the person strongly identified with this function “elevates . . . an objectively oriented intellectual formula . . . into the ruling principle not only for himself but for his whole environment” (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶585). On the other hand, this most characteristic function of the Enlightenment period must have guided John Locke in establishing principles of government that many in the West still believe have universal applicability—as well as Mozart in elaborating musical ideas that everyone soon could follow.

Extraverted sensation, as a cognitive process, seeks “an accumulation of actual experiences of concrete objects” (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶606) and the function can become, in the moment, so riveted on the reality ‘out there’ that it cannot recognize that other things may also be happening at that same time: this is a function perfect for watching a basketball game, but it may not notice that someone is about to say or do something unexpected.

Extraverted intuition can become so engaged with the possibilities of its objects that, for the person strongly identified with this function, “it is as though his whole life vanished in the new situation” (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶613). To use a metaphor to describe what is really an unmediated, instinctive process, this function operates like a traffic signal, indicating with its green light when it is time to proceed to develop something, with its red light when it is time to stop, and with its yellow light when one must proceed with caution. A significant problem is that people without a similar degree of development of extraverted intuition may not perceive the presence of any signal at all and thus cannot understand why the person led by such intuitions is rushing ahead, stopping, or pausing when he does. And extraverted intuition’s failure to heed sensation cues can undermine its claim to have ‘seen’ anything at all.

In Psychological Types, Jung offered the all-important notion of a selective differentiation of the various functions of consciousness as the key to the different degrees and styles of consciousness individual people display. As he puts it in his 79-page section of definitions at the end of the book,

Differentiation means the development of differences, the separation of parts from the whole. In this work I employ the concept of differentiation chiefly with respect to the psychological functions. So long as a function is still so fused with one or more other functions—thinking with feeling, feeling with sensation, etc.—that it is unable to operate on its own, it is in an archaic condition, i.e., not differentiated, not separated from the whole as a special part and existing by itself. Undifferentiated thinking is incapable of thinking apart from other functions; it is continually mixed up with sensations, feelings, intuitions, just as undifferentiated feeling is mixed up with sensations and fantasies, as for instance in the sexualization (Freud) of feeling and thinking in a neurosis.

Jung, 1921/1971, ¶705

As long as a function is undifferentiated, moreover, it cannot be deployed in the conscious manner of a directed mental process that is truly under the control of the ego, and capable of being applied to tasks and goals: “Without differentiation direction is impossible, since the direction of a function towards a goal depends on the elimination of anything irrelevant. Fusion with the irrelevant precludes direction; only a differentiated function is capable of being directed” (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶705).

These passages hold the key to why, in the first English translation (by H. G. Baynes) of Pyschologische Typen, the work bore the subtitle, “or, The Psychology of Individuation” (Jung 1921, 1923). One way to understand what Jung meant by individuation is the progressive differentiation of the various psychological functions of consciousness. For, as he puts it elsewhere in the Definitions section, “Individuation . . . is a process of differentiation (q.v.) having for its goal the development of the individual personality.” It is “an extension of the sphere of consciousness, an enriching of conscious psychological life” (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶¶757, 762).

Since Jung also believed that individuation, i.e. the development of consciousness, is a natural process, he felt that there was a way to describe its orderly unfolding in all of us, and he used his idea of psychological types to offer certain developmental guidelines. These guidelines have been mostly ignored outside the narrow circle of those who are interested in the theory of psychological types, but they are most important, as they hold the key to much of what happens in psychotherapy when a personality starts to develop.

Jung believed that we all get a head start in individuation through a natural tendency to differentiate at least two function-attitudes out of our total potential complement of eight.[3](part0023.xhtml#IvK3oXOfSouYfENtHegYLQ2730) The two function-attitudes that most naturally tend to differentiate early in our development of ego-consciousness will not be the same for each individual. Because they develop so early they appear to be innate, although later “falsification of type” as a result of environmental influences can distort the individual’s typological bent (Benziger, 1995). Sixteen psychological type profiles can be distinguished simply on the basis of which of the eight function-attitudes turns out to be the most differentiated—the dominant or ‘superior’ function—and which the next most differentiated—the ‘auxiliary’ function.

Jung found that “[f]or all the types met with in practice, the rule holds good that besides the conscious, primary function there is a relatively unconscious, auxiliary function which is in every respect different from the nature of the primary function” (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶669). Since he also believed that “naturally only these functions can appear as auxiliary whose nature is not opposed to the dominant function” (the emphasis is mine), feeling, for instance, “can never act as the second function alongside thinking” (¶667) nor sensation alongside intuition. Rather, if with respect to differentiation someone’s first, or superior, function is on the rational axis (i.e. is either thinking or feeling) then that individual’s auxiliary function will have to come from the irrational axis (be either sensation or intuition).

A superior thinking function will thus be paired with only one of two possible other functions in the course of normal type development—either an auxiliary sensation or an auxiliary intuition. Similarly, a superior sensation function, being on the irrational axis, will take as its auxiliary a function from the rational axis, meaning that it can be paired only with thinking or feeling. The following possibilities naturally emerge:

Superior/Auxiliary

Feeling/Intuition

Feeling/Sensation

Thinking/Intuition

Thinking/Sensation

Intuition/Feeling

Intuition/Thinking

Sensation/Feeling

Sensation/Thinking

This scheme is the basic model for the differentiation of the eight function-attitudes into different types of people. Given that each of the leading functions can be either extraverted or introverted (for instance, feeling/intuition could describe the typology of a person with either introverted feeling with auxiliary intuition or extraverted feeling with auxiliary intuition), it follows that, typologically speaking, there are at least sixteen kinds of people.

Even this differentiation does not, unfortunately, clarify the problem of whether there is any difference in attitude between the first two functions in an actual individual. The clinician should be aware that Jung’s text has been interpreted in two different ways by later commentators. Apparently seizing on Jung’s assertion that the secondary function is “not antagonistic to” the primary one, Jo Wheelwright (1982) concluded that the first two functions would have the same attitude with respect to extraversion and introversion. Isabel Briggs Myers, on the other hand, took Jung’s subsequent statement, that the auxiliary function is “in every respect different from the nature of the primary function,” to mean that the auxiliary must differ from the superior function in attitude (Myers & Myers, 1980, pp. 18–21).

It should be noted that Jung took for granted that most consciousnesses are so undifferentiated that even the auxiliary function is rarely more than “relatively unconscious” (¶669). Too fine a distinction regarding the attitude of the auxiliary would not have made a great deal of sense to him: everything besides the superior function was still more or less unconscious anyway. He spoke of a shadowy tertiary function, and a fourth, ‘inferior’ function to which he gave a special status, as a source of problematic, touchy reactions because of its especial closeness to the unconscious. This inferior function (a notion that can be traced to Schiller, as Bishop (2008) has recently emphasized) is “the function that lags behind in the process of differentiation” (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶763). Often a source of shame, the inferior function is conceived of as being carried by the anima in a man, and the animus in a woman, in contrast to the superior function, which is identified with the persona.

The inferior function will always be the other pole of the typological axis (whether rational or irrational) on which the superior function falls; so a superior thinking function will be plagued by an inferior feeling function, superior sensation by inferior intuition, superior intuition by inferior sensation, and superior feeling by inferior thinking. Moreover (and here there is more agreement in the Jungian tradition) if the superior function is introverted, the inferior function will be extraverted; and if the superior is extraverted, the inferior function will be introverted. The axis between the superior and inferior functions is what I have called the ‘spine’ of personality (Beebe, 1992, pp. 106–107). There are eight possible spines (shown in [Figure 3.4](part0014.xhtml#page_39), p. 39, as vertical lines). If one imagines each of these line diagrams as a stick figure representing a person who is facing the reader, the auxiliary function appears as the figure’s ‘right hand,’ which will be to the reader’s left. The different figures that share the same superior function are shown in pairs, as two figures side by side, with identical spines but different auxiliary functions, making sixteen standpoints in all.

These are the famous sixteen ‘types’ of personality that most people are referring to when they use the term ‘psychological types’: they have been described as the ‘MBTI types’ by those who have learned to recognize the superior and auxiliary functions with the help of the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator. However, it might be clearer to call them ‘type profiles.’ Using Jung’s rules for type differentiation and understanding Isabel Briggs Myers’ notion of “good type development” (Myers & Kirby, 2000), it is clear that the differentiation of a strong natural superior and accompanying auxiliary function that is different in every respect is the starting point for further differentiation. The other function-attitudes operate largely out of awareness until and unless they become conscious in the course of development.

Innovations, criticisms and developments

Although types were carefully studied by other analysts who were trained by Jung, including Meier (1959, 1989), Henderson (1970) and Wheelwright (1982), the most important development of psychological types within analytical psychology came from Marie-Louise von Franz (1971/1998), who colorfully described the eight different types of the inferior function. She also clarified the relation of the inferior function to Jung’s transcendent function, pointing out that if the inferior function is made conscious, then the relation to the unconscious changes and the personality is unified (von Franz, 1971/1998, pp. 67–79; see also Beebe 1992, pp. 102–109). She explained that Jung’s hierarchy of first, second and third functions implies a relative order in which the functions can be differentiated in the course of a psychotherapy, although she indicated that once the superior function has been established one can choose whether to develop the second or third function next. No one, she argued (and Jung also says this), can simply take up the inferior function directly and develop it. Not only does it tend to “stay low” (E. Osterman, personal communication, 1972), it cannot even be approached effectively until the first three functions have been differentiated.

I pursued this line of thought by clarifying the archetypal constraints around the differentiation of the function-attitudes in the course of development (for a discussion of my ideas about this, see Harris, 1996, pp. 65–76). Noting that the superiority of the leading function derives from its association with the hero archetype, I went on to identify the archetypal figures that carry the other three functions in the hierarchy that Jung and von Franz established. Following the evidence of dreams and also movies in which the auxiliary and tertiary functions are often symbolized as an older and younger person of the same sex as the figure identified with the superior function, I have concluded that the auxiliary function is carried by a stable parental figure (usually a father in a man and a mother in a woman) and the tertiary function by an unstable child figure who is given to cycles of inflation and deflation (puer aeternus in a man, puella aeterna in a woman). Although von Franz spoke broadly of the fourth, inferior function as “the door through which all the figures of the unconscious come” (1971/1998, p. 67), I have identified the fourth function, since it is consciously experienced as a problematic aspect of oneself, not with the shadow, but with the anima and animus. It is the other four functions that constitute the true shadow of the first four, a shadow accentuated by the process of differentiation that allows the first four to develop and become conscious function-attitudes.[4](part0023.xhtml#IvK3oXOfSouYfENtHegYLQ2870) For example, a man with superior extraverted thinking and auxiliary introverted sensation will have introverted thinking and extraverted sensation strongly in shadow. When he develops tertiary extraverted intuition, introverted intuition will be rejected and become an aspect of his shadow. The inferior function has a shadow too. In this individual, who would have inferior introverted feeling carried by the anima, a shadow of extraverted feeling could be found as an intelligence operating outside his awareness.

In this way, I was able to conceptualize a first typology of the shadow (although Naomi Quenk (1993), not long after, produced her own typological model of the shadow in the book Beside Ourselves). According to the model of typology I have developed ([Chapter 3](part0014.xhtml)), specific archetypes carry the shadows of the first four functions: the opposing personality (carrying the shadow of the hero), the senex or witch (shadow of the father or mother), the trickster (shadow of the puer or puella), and the demonic/daimonic personality (shadow of the anima/animus). [Figure 10.1](part0023.xhtml#IvK3oXOfSouYfENtHegYLQ2773) shows how this model organizes the basic archetypal complexes as part-personalities that express themselves through their individual function-attitudes. The example depicted here is of a person with dominant extraverted thinking and auxiliary introverted sensation (ESTJ).

[FIGURE 10.1](part0006.xhtml#IvK3oXOfSouYfENtHegYLQ2786)    Archetypal/type complexes (using ESTJ as an example)

My model implies that development of all eight function-attitudes will involve a significant engagement with each of the archetypal complexes, and a differentiation of each function out of its archetypal manifestation. In integrating one’s typology, the issues associated with each archetypal complex must be faced, exactly as in classical individuation, which has been conceived as the progressive integration of the collective unconscious through engagement with a series of archetypal figures. Moreover, as Papadopoulos (1992, vol. 2, p. 6) pointed out, the model provides a rational basis for analyzing archetypal interactions between individuals on the basis of typology. Recognizing correlations between functions and complexes in an individual patient can be very helpful to the therapist, especially when encountering markedly altered states of mind in patients. At such times the therapist can often help to re-establish ego strength in the patient by speaking the language of the patient’s superior function rather than mirroring the typological idiom of the possessing complex (Sandner & Beebe, 1995, pp. 317–344). An account of the way Jung worked with an analytic patient whose reality testing was overwhelmed by an eruption of intuitive religious imagery reveals how he used his understanding of typology to guide an intervention that helped her recover her natural sensation type orientation (von der Heydt, 1975). In less florid, but nevertheless demanding, borderline and narcissistic conditions, function-attitudes that are in shadow for a client can be associated with archetypal defenses of the self, and it advances therapy to understand their precise character (Beebe, 1998b).

Other noteworthy contributions to the conceptual and clinical elucidation of the theory of psychological types have been as follows:

•    Meier’s (1959) exposition of the transference–countertransference in terms of a ‘rotation’ of the analyst’s typological mandala to bring his or her orientation into attunement with the analysand’s;

•    Mann, Siegler and Osmond’s (1968) discussion of the different relations to time among the different functions (sensation, in their view, being present oriented, feeling being past oriented, intuition future oriented, and thinking having a continuous time line through past, present, and future);

•    Marshall’s (1968) clarification of ‘rational’ and ‘irrational’ through his conceptual analysis of the functions (sensation and intuition revealed to be ‘functions of the given’ and thinking and feeling as ‘functions of option’);

•    James Hillman’s (1971/1998) well-drawn distinctions between aspects of the feeling function and affect, the anima, and the persona, and his discussion of the role of inferior feeling in synchronistic phenomena;

•    William Willeford’s (1975, 1976, 1977) insistence on the ‘primacy’ of feeling in the hierarchy of functions (because it is the function that discriminates affect) and his demonstration of the importance of the mother–infant relationship in the evocation of the feeling function (1987);

•    Shapiro and Alexander’s (1975) phenomenological analysis of the characteristic ‘moves’ of extraversion (merger with the object) and introversion (matching with the archetype) in creating experience;

•    Groesbeck’s (1978) examination of the role of the analyst’s tertiary and inferior functions in the constellation of the ‘wounded healer’ archetype during analysis;

•    Kirsch’s (1980) observation that introverted therapists tend to interpret dreams on the subject level and extraverted therapists on the object level;

•    Sabini’s (1988) discussion of the therapist’s inferior function;

•    Murphy’s (1992) demonstration that the dominant function is a recognizable structure of personality that is stably present from early childhood, providing a basic orientation that persists through the various stages of a child’s development in which auxiliary, tertiary, and inferior functions gradually make their additional appearances;

•    Hill’s (1998) discussion of the typology of the anima;

•    Ulanov’s (2009) analysis of the relation of the inferior function to the facing of life itself;

•    Pilard’s (2015) comprehensive survey of the psychological nature of intuition, including the philosophical background, its acceptance by Jung as one of the functions of consciousness, and the development of the concept by post-Jungian analysts.

All of these writers have appreciated and extended the therapeutic possibilities of Jung’s typological formulations.

Another significant line of development of the theory of psychological types has been in the area of standardized type assessment instruments. Although in the 1940s Jo Wheelwright, together with his wife Jane Wheelwright plus Horace Gray and later John Buehler, produced the first paper-and-pencil type assessment, the Gray–Wheelwrights Jungian Type Survey (JTS), and did pioneering research with this instrument (Mattoon & Davis, 1995), it was really the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) developed by Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother Katherine Briggs, who were not Jungian analysts, that put standardized type instruments on the map internationally. The MBTI, developed in earnest from 1942 and finally licensed in the 1960s, has become one of the most popular psychological instruments in the English-speaking world and is starting to be used in translation in other countries (see Quenk, 2000 for a description). It is regularly used by career counselors to assess the ‘type’ of clients looking for work that suits them, as well as in human resources and personnel departments all over the world. A Center for Applications of Psychological Type in Gainesville, Florida, maintains a large statistical database of MBTI results. In the United States, the Association for Psychological Type, which in the mid-1980s, when Jungian ideas were everywhere popular, had several thousand members, continues now, as the Association for Psychological Type International, to host conferences sharing experience and research based on not only the MBTI, but other approaches to typology (including my own). There are similar organizations in other countries. There is also a type assessment for children, the Murphy–Meisgeier Type Indicator for Children (MMTIC). All of these paper-and-pencil questionnaires involve forced choices constructed according to Jung’s “bipolar assumption” that we cannot think and feel, or take in sensation and use intuition, at the same time. In 1980, Jungian analysts June Singer and Mary Loomis offered their own instrument, the Singer–Loomis Inventory of Personality (SLIP), which does not build on this assumption; instead it assesses the level of development of each of the eight function-attitudes separately (Loomis, 1982). A comparison of findings, undertaken to determine the extent of agreement between the JTS, MBTI and SLIP was published in 1994.

Results found that the MBTI and the JTS both indicated extraversion–introversion with substantial agreement, sensing–intuition with moderate agreement, and thinking–feeling with limited agreement. Evidence was equivocal for the instruments’ ability to indicate dominant function. It appears that the SLIP measures different constructs than either the MBTI or the JTS, so that little support was found for Singer and Loomis’ challenge to Jung’s bipolarity assumption.

Karesh, Pieper, & Holland, 1994, p. 30

The popularity of the MBTI has resulted in a spate of publications in print and online, the Australian Psychological Type Review, the Bulletin of Psychological Type, the Journal of Psychological Type, Personality Type in Depth, and TypeFace being some of the main ones in English. Myers also is responsible for the terms ‘judging’ and ‘perceiving’ as less loaded synonyms for ‘rational’ and ‘irrational,’ although the instrument confines its J and P descriptors to the characterization of the leading extraverted function. Myers also introduced the notion of ‘good type development’ to suggest a progressive differentiation of the functions according to the hierarchy of superior, auxiliary, tertiary and inferior. In recent years, a controversy has developed as to whether the third and fourth functions continue the alternation of attitudes (with respect to extraversion or introversion) begun by the first two functions. The regularly alternating pattern I first proposed publically at the initial Ghost Ranch Conference of Jungian Analysts and Candidates in 1983 (Beebe, 1984) and proceeded to teach across the United States over the next five years as the key to the attitude of the third function (opposite from the auxiliary) was separately proposed with near simultaneity by Grant, Thompson, and Clarke (1983) and Brownsword (1988). At present, it is a popular view, although leading type practitioners and Jungian analysts who have devoted attention to the types have certainly dissented, Spoto (1995) in the matter of the third function-changing attitude from that of the auxiliary, and Wheelwright and Wheelwright (1987) as to the attitude of the auxiliary function being different from that of the dominant. Everyone seems to agree on one point, however: that the fourth or inferior function has the opposite attitude from the first or dominant function.

Important attempts to integrate the empirical discoveries of those who have developed the MBTI instrument into the clinical and conceptual tradition of analytical psychology have been made by Angelo Spoto (1995), John Giannini (2004) and myself (Beebe, 1984). Elizabeth Murphy (1992) has spearheaded the study of type development in children and has produced materials to help parents and teachers understand how to communicate effectively with children of different types. There have also been attempts to link the eight Jungian function-attitudes and sixteen MBTI type profiles to a new notion of temperament (Keirsey & Bates, 1984; Berens, 1998), Sheldon’s body types (Arraj & Arraj, 1988), the DSM-IV personality disorders (Ekstrom, 1988), the Neo-PI ‘Big-5’ Personality Factors (McCrae & Costa, 1989; Wiggins, 1996; Scanlon, 1999), and the ‘multiple intelligences’ of cognitive psychology (Gardner, 1983; Thompson, 1985; Goleman, 1995). The types have been linked to religious orientation (Ross, 1992) and moral decision-making styles (Beebe, 1992, 1998a; Burleson, 2001). Within academic psychology, Kagan (1994, 1998) has recognized Jung’s contributions to a theory of temperament but warned of the problems inherent in trying to understand these issues without a grasp of inherent physiology as well as psychology. Dario Nardi (2011) has pioneered research to find correlations between brain activity and Jung’s eight functions of consciousness. Linda Berens (2008) has been a unifying leader in the types movement, integrating multiple approaches to analyzing psychological diversity into an intellectually consistent framework. Her recent work with Christopher Montoya on a “cognitive styles lens” (Montoya, 2014) holds promise in the way that it implicitly looks at whole axes rather than only at individual function preferences.

Current status and trends

Type is still a ‘hard sell’ among many analysts. A study published by Plaut (1972) revealed that less than half of Jungian analysts use type in their clinical work.[5](part0023.xhtml#IvK3oXOfSouYfENtHegYLQ2788) Those who do often rely on questionnaire results rather than clinical observation to establish the ‘type diagnosis.’ Many of these analysts are unaware that the Association for Psychological Type considers it unethical to type someone simply on the basis of their results on the MBTI, which is after all only an ‘Indicator.’ There must be at least a follow-up interview in which the results of the assessment are explained with a proviso along the lines of, ‘this is the type the instrument indicates, and you can see if it really fits you.’ Nevertheless, Annie Murphy Paul (2004) has severely criticized the way the MBTI has been used by teachers and career counselors to assign identities to individuals.

In psychotherapeutic circles, sadly, few clinicians can even recognize the eight function-attitudes, confusing introverted feeling with introverted intuition, not knowing the difference between extraverted and introverted thinking and so on. (Sharp’s (1987) book is an excellent remedial primer.) Many do not really understand the difference between introversion and extraversion as processes in the self. (This is helpfully addressed in Lavin’s (1995) article.)

One place type theory has taken limited, but promising, hold in clinical work is in the area of couple therapy and marriage counseling. Therapists who have explained the types to their clients have often reported that the results are very satisfying, in terms of creating appropriate expectations between the partners and helping them to adjust their communication styles.

There can be no real advance in the understanding of Jung’s most subtle and far-reaching contribution to ego psychology, however, until many more analytical psychologists become much more type-literate than they are nowadays. Then we can hope for some interesting research that follows up the implications of Jung’s theory of psychological types, research that can also move our understanding of the actual path of individuation forward.

Those of us who are interested in this theory need to establish its relevance to cognitive psychology in general, and to what, in a contemporary nod to faculty psychology, has been called “the modularity of mind” (Fodor, 1983). That a differentiation of functions emerges out of the complexity of consciousness itself suggests that consciousness is rooted in the very same structures, our complexes, that threaten to restrict and cloud our egos. Complexes enable new capacities to appear to the degree that we engage with them. Jung demonstrated that letting our complexes tell their different stories of how they see things is a way to experience the range of consciousness. The psychological processes that facilitate the emergence of consciousness (Cambray, 2006) Jung called archetypal, which today we recognize in their predilection for sorting themselves in a self-organizing way (Saunders & Sklar, 2001; Hogenson, 2007). That consciousness appears to the psyche as a quaternity of functions, mirrored by an equally quaternary shadow showing the same functions with the opposite attitudes, means that its structure imitates that of the Self, as became clear to the later Jung (1951/1959, ¶398). His typology has therefore turned out to be, not his ego psychology, as so many of us assumed, but his self psychology. In its patterning, typology recognizes many paths that psyche provides for consciousness to travel; in its complexity, typology demonstrates dynamic interactions between the paths that drive consciousness itself forward.

## Notes

[1](part0023.xhtml#IvK3oXOfSouYfENtHegYLQ2839)    The terms ‘extraversion’ and ‘introversion’ were apparently adapted from Binet’s terms ‘externospection’ and ‘introspection’ (Binet, 1903, cited by Oliver Brachfeld (1954) in Ellenberger (1970, pp. 702–703).

[2](part0023.xhtml#IvK3oXOfSouYfENtHegYLQ2900)    Carolyn Fay (1996) has suggested this be called “feeling value.”

[3](part0023.xhtml#IvK3oXOfSouYfENtHegYLQ2768)    ‘Function,’ strictly, refers to the four functions of consciousness—sensation, thinking, feeling and intuition—whereas ‘attitude’ suggests the habitual way the attention is directed —whether extraverted or introverted—when the psyche acts or reacts (Jung, 1921/1971, ¶687). In the type literature, it is common to identify the extraverted and introverted deployment of a function when specifying it; hence rather than speaking of four functions and two attitudes, people nowadays speak of eight function-attitudes (Thompson, 1996). These eight cognitive modes offer a total complement of possibilities for conscious orientation that can potentially be differentiated as we individuate.

[4](part0023.xhtml#IvK3oXOfSouYfENtHegYLQ2805)    Here, I have followed Myers, and not Wheelwright, in finding that the auxiliary function is different in attitude from the superior function, and have asserted that the attitudes of the functions alternate in the course of their differentiation, so that if the first, superior, function is extraverted, the auxiliary function will be introverted, the tertiary extraverted, and the inferior introverted.

[5](part0023.xhtml#IvK3oXOfSouYfENtHegYLQ2845)    Bradway and Detloff (1976) established the incidence of the different psychological types among Jungian analysts, and Bradway and Wheelwright (1978) studied the relation of the psychological type of the analyst to the analysts’ actual analytical practices, finding, for instance, that extraverts tend to use typology more than introverts in making connections and interpretations with their patients and that typology is used more often by San Francisco than by London Jungian analysts.

[^1]: 术语“外倾性 (extraversion)”和“内倾性 (introversion)”明显是根据比奈（Binet）的术语“外省（externospection）”和“内省（introspection）”改编而来。（比奈，1903, 由奥利弗·布拉赫菲尔德 (Olive Brachfeld) 引自艾伦伯格 (Ellenberge)，1970：702-3）。

[^2]: 卡罗琳·费 (Carolyn Fay)（1996）认为应该称作“情感价值”。
