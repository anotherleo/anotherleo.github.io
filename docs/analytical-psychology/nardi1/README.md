# Decode Your Personality
## Welcome!

What’s your personality type—your operating system? And how can you use that to find greater satisfaction in life?

Maybe you’ve heard of the Myers-Briggs 4-letter type code. That would be ESTJ, INFP, and so on for 16 types total. While 16 types sounds like a lot, really it’s not. It’s all too common for people to struggle to find a great fit, or they plain can’t decide, or they simply need more specificity.

Since 2006, I’ve worked hands on, conducting brain imaging of people from all over the world, and all walks of life, with different personality profiles. Imagine sitting in a lab, wearing a nylon cap with sensors, and doing a dozen tasks over the course of 40 minutes—in return, you get a report on your brain, skills, and personality. The neuroscience reveals that we all use our brains differently, and brain-wiring correlates with personality, skills, and demographics like career and upbringing.

The neuroscience takes us with confidence beyond 16 types, with 4 neuro-variants of each type, for 64 subtypes total. These subtypes are more than “smaller boxes”. They reflect our lives as lived, reflect where we are now, and suggest where we might easily go. They remind us of different facets of ourselves and our potential to grow. Importantly, they give us a map to make life changes and become more fulfilled.

One of the biggest insights: **The way we work, day to day, shapes our brains, whatever our personality type**. Maybe you are in a leadership position, or you are one of many in a large pool of workers. Or maybe you work one-on-one in a personal way, or you like small creative teams where you can “think different”. I’ve met people who identify with the same personality type who otherwise relate to these different work situations. There are ISTJ CEOs, ISTJ postal clerks, ISTJ musicians, and ISTJ psychologists. The Myers-Briggs type code by itself is not enough to describe someone’s life, their passion, or their development. So we need more, and now we can go deeper.

We will start with the basics, cracking the 4-letter code and revealing the underlying framework as defined by the famous Dr. Carl Jung. From there, we get into the meat and potatoes: the story of the subtypes and the opportunity to explore any or all of the 64 profiles. Every profile is based on actual brain-imaging and demographic data. And all along the way, we remember the dynamic nature of personality. People are not just clusters of behavioral traits. We are alive, complex, and multi-faceted with neuroses, energy management issues, hidden aspirations, and particular keys to growth.

As you explore and understand the subtypes, I hope you will find a better path forward in your life. This book is called, “Decode Your Personality”, and the word “decode” has two meanings. One is learning the hidden meaning of the letters in a code. The other is going beyond a code, to de-code who you are and return to your organic sense with all of its potential. The point of having a language, or a lens to describe personality is ultimately to step beyond it. Everyone is already in a box of their own and others’ making. And, when we are informed and can name what we see, we have a lever to step out and make our lives better.

After you explore the subtypes, you may want to learn about coaching advice, the *yin* and *yang* sides of yourself, and how to navigate the neurotic boundary of each type. That extra stuff is up to you.

To quote Joel Mark Witt of Personality Hacker, “The power of Personality Profiling is not that we simply know your personality type, it’s that we know HOW you are your personality type. This gives us the power to help you through coaching and advice.”

Thank you for taking the time to listen, read, think, observe, and get to know yourself. The examined life is worth living, and the purposeful life even more so. Let’s dive in!

Cheers,
