# DEFINITIONS

It may perhaps seem superfluous that I should add to my text a chapter dealing solely with definitions. But ample experience has taught me that, in psychological works particularly, one cannot proceed too cautiously in regard to the concepts and terms one uses: for nowhere do such wide divergences of meaning occur as in the domain of psychology, creating only too frequently the most obstinate misunderstandings. This drawback is due not only to the fact that the science of psychology is still in its infancy; there is the further difficulty that the empirical material, the object of scientific investigation, cannot be displayed in concrete form, as it were, before the eyes of the reader. The psychological investigator is always finding himself obliged to make extensive use of an indirect method of description in order to present the reality he has observed. Only in so far as elementary facts are communicated which are amenable to quantitative measurement can there be any question of a direct presentation. But how much of the actual psychology of man can be experienced and observed as quantitatively measurable facts? Such facts do exist, and I believe I have shown in my association studiesthat extremely complicated psychological facts are accessible to quantitative measurement. But anyone who has probed more deeply into the nature of psychology, demanding something more of it as a science than that it should confine itself within the narrow limits of the scientific method, will also have realized that an experimental method will never succeed in doing justice to the nature of the human psyche, nor will it ever project anything like a true picture of the more complex psychic phenomena.

或许我给本书添加一个独立的章节专门用来讨论定义似乎是多余的。但是丰富的经验告诉我，尤其在心理学著作中，人们并不会更详细地关注那些所使用的概念和术语：因为没有任何地方会像在心理学领域中那样产生如此众多的概念上的歧义，如此频繁地产生最为固执己见的曲解。这一缺陷并不仅仅因为心理科学尚处襁褓之中；而且更因为这样的困难，作为心理科学研究的对象即经验材料，无法以具体的形式展示出来，也就是说，它们无法置诸读者的眼前。心理学研究者总是发现自己不得不广泛地使用间接的描述方法来表现他所观察到的现实。只有当基本事实的传达能通过数量测量的方式来进行时才存在直接表现的问题。但是，人的具体心理如何能被当作可测量的事实来进行体验和观察呢？然而这样的事实确实存在着，我相信我对自由联想的研究表明：极为复杂的心理事实仍然可以凭借数量测量的方法获得理解。但是，一个想更深地涉及到心理学的本质的人，只要他对一门科学要求更多的东西，而并不把它限制在科学方法的十分狭窄的范围内，他就会认识到，实验的方法从来就不可能公正地对待人类心灵的本质，甚至也不可能描绘出一幅大体上忠实于复杂心理现象的图像。

But once we leave the domain of measurable facts we are dependent on *concepts*, which have now to take over the role of measure and number. The precision which measure and number lend to the observed fact can be replaced only by the *precision of the concept*. Unfortunately, as every investigator and worker in this field knows only too well, current psychological concepts are so imprecise and so ambiguous that mutual understanding is practically impossible. One has only to take the concept “feeling,” for instance, and try to visualize everything this concept comprises, to get some sort of notion of the variability and ambiguity of psychological concepts in general. And yet the concept of feeling does express something characteristic that, though not susceptible of quantitative measurement, nevertheless palpably exists. One simply cannot resign oneself, as Wundt does in his physiological psychology, to a mere denial of such essential and fundamental phenomena, and seek to replace them by elementary facts or to resolve them into such. In this way an essential part of psychology is thrown overboard.

然而，我们一旦离开这一可测量的事实的王国，我们就只能依赖于概念了，它们现在替代了测量和数字的位置。测量和数字给予被观察的事实的那种精确性现在只能由概念的精确性（precision of theconcept）来取代了。但不幸的是，正如这一领域的每一个调查者和研究者所十分熟悉的那样，现有的心理学概念是如此的不明确和如此的模糊不清，以致相互理解几乎是不可能的。例如我们只能这样接受“情感”这一概念，我们试图把它所包含的一切都具体化，以便获得某种对一般心理学概念的变异性和模糊性的认识。然而，情感的概念确实表达了某些具有特征的东西，这些东西无法为量化测量所理解，但仍然可觉察其存在。我们不能像冯特在他的生理心理学中所做的那样，听任这种根本的和主要的心理现象被简单地否定掉，而寻求以原初的事实来取代它们，或者将它们消解于原初的事实中。在这种方法中，心理的本质部分就完全被抛弃了。

In order to escape the ill consequences of this overvaluation of the scientific method, one is obliged to have recourse to well-defined concepts. But in order to arrive at such concepts, the collaboration of many workers would be needed, a sort of *consensus gentium*. Since this is not within the bounds of possibility at present, the individual investigator must at least try to give his concepts some fixity and precision, and this can best be done by discussing the meaning of the concepts he employs so that everyone is in a position to see what in fact he means by them.

为了避免对自然科学方法的过高评价所引起的弊端，我们不得不求助于精确-定义的概念。但是，为了获得这样的概念，众多研究者的精诚协作是必需的，我们必须赢得普遍的赞同（consensus gentium）。既然这种普遍的赞同并不能马上就可能实现，那么个别研究者就至少必须努力赋予他的概念以某种稳定性和精确性，通过阐释他所运用的概念的意义，以便使每个具有自己的立场的人都能看到他运用这些概念时所真正意指的东西，这或许是最恰当的。

To meet this need I now propose to discuss my principal psychological concepts in alphabetical order, and I would like the reader to refer to these explanations in case of doubt. It goes without saying that these definitions and explanations are merely intended to establish the sense in which I myself use the concepts; far be it from me to affirm that this use is in all circumstances the only possible one or the absolutely right one.

现在，我想按照字母顺序来论述我的主要心理学概念正是为了顺应这种需要，并且，我愿意趁此机会向读者解释各种可能出现的疑问。这并不是说，这些定义和解释仅仅意在用来确证我本人运用这些概念的意义；我绝不想宣称我的概念的运用在任何情况下都是唯一可能的或绝对正确的。

## 1. 抽象作用 (abstraction)

ABSTRACTION, as the word itself indicates, is the drawing out or singling out of a content (a meaning, a general characteristic, etc.) from a context made up of other elements whose combination into a whole is something unique or individual and therefore cannot be compared with anything else. Singularity, uniqueness, and incomparability are obstacles to cognition; hence the other elements associated with a content that is felt to be the essential one are bound to appear irrelevant.

顾名思义，抽象作用是从一种其他诸多因素所构成的联系中将某种内容（某种意义或某种一般特征等等）抽取或分离出来，这些因素之组合成一个整体是因为它具有某些独特的或个别的东西，因而也无法同其他东西进行比较。单一性、唯一性和不可比较性都是认识的障碍；所以，那些与被当作基本的因素的内容相联系的其他因素必然显得无关紧要。

Abstraction, therefore, is a form of mental activity that frees this content from its association with the irrelevant elements by distinguishing it from them or, in other words, *differentiating* it (v. *Differentiation*). In its wider sense, everything is *abstract* that is separated from its association with elements that are felt to have no relevance to its meaning.

因此，抽象作用是一种精神活动的形式，它将本质性内容从其与无关紧要的因素的联系中解放出来，使之彼此区分开来，或者换句话说，使其分化出来（参见“分化”条）。从更广泛的意义上看，一切将本质性内容从与其他因素的联系中分离出来的活动都是抽象，而那些其他的因素被认为是与其意义无关紧要的。

Abstraction is an activity pertaining to the psychological *functions* (q.v.) in general. There is an abstract *thinking*, just as there is abstract *feeling, sensation*, and *intuition* (qq. v.). Abstract thinking singles out the rational, logical qualities of a given content from its intellectually irrelevant components. Abstract feeling does the same with a content characterized by its feeling-values; similarly with sensation and intuition. Hence, not only are there abstract thoughts but also abstract feelings, the latter being defined by Sully as intellectual, aesthetic, and moral. To these Nahlowsky adds all religious feelings. Abstract feelings would, in my view, correspond to the “higher” or “ideal” feelings of Nahlowsky. I put abstract feelings on the same level as abstract thoughts. Abstract sensation would be aesthetic as opposed to sensuous *sensation* (q.v.), and abstract intuition would be symbolic as opposed to fantastic *intuition* (v. *Fantasy* and *Intuition)*.

抽象作用是一种属于一般心理功能的活动。正如存在抽象的情感、感觉和直觉一样，也存在抽象的思维（参见这些条目）。抽象思维从它于理智上认为的不相干的组成成分中挑选出理性的、符合逻辑的特定的内容来。抽象情感借助情感-价值的判断而挑选出具有同样特征的内容；抽象感觉和抽象直觉亦是如此。因此，不仅存在着抽象的思想而且也存在着抽象的情感，后者被萨利（Sully）界定为理性的、审美的和道德的情感。纳洛斯基（Nahlowsky）又增加了宗教的情感。在我看来，抽象情感与纳洛斯基的“高级情感”或“理想情感”相吻合。我把抽象情感与抽象思想放在同一级次上。抽象感觉是审美的感觉，它与感官的感觉（参见“感觉”条）相对应，而抽象直觉是象征的直觉，它与幻想的直觉相对应（参见“幻想”和“直觉”条）。

In this work I also associate abstraction with the awareness of the psycho-energic process it involves. When I take an abstract attitude to an object, I do not allow the object to affect me in its totality; I focus my attention on one part of it by excluding all the irrelevant parts. My aim is to disembarrass myself of the object as a singular and unique whole and to abstract only a portion of this whole. No doubt I am aware of the whole, but I do not immerse myself in this awareness; my interest does not flow into the whole, but draws back from it, pulling the abstracted portion into myself, into my conceptual world, which is already prepared or constellated for the purpose of abstracting a part of the object. (It is only because of a subjective constellation of concepts that I am able to abstract from the object.) “Interest” I conceive as the energy or *libido*(q.v.) which I bestow on the object as a value, or which the object draws from me, maybe even against my will or unknown to myself. I visualize the process of abstraction as a withdrawal of libido from the object, as a backflow of value from the object into a subjective, abstract content. For me, therefore, abstraction amounts to an energic *devaluation of the object*. In other words, abstraction is an introverting movement of libido (v. *Introversion*).

在本书中，我也把抽象作用与对心理能量过程的意识联系起来。当我对一个客体采取抽象态度时，我不会让客体从整体上影响我；而是通过排除所有不相干的部分而把注意力集中在其某一部分上。我的目的是要摆脱作为单独和唯一整体的客体，而只抽取它的一个部分。毫无疑问，我意识到了这个整体，但我并没有陷入这种意识中；我的兴趣并没有全部进入整体，而是从它那里抽身而退，将其抽取的部分带给了我，进入了我的概念世界，这个世界早就为抽取客体的某部分这一目的做好了准备或者说把它们聚集（constellated）起来了。（只有借助概念的主观聚集我才可能拥有从客体中抽象的力量。）我把“兴趣”理解为能量或欲力（参见“欲力”条），欲力又被我当作价值赋予了客体，或者说客体从我身上取得了欲力，这样做时甚至可能是违背我的意志的，或者我自己根本就不知道。因此，我把抽象的过程具体化为一种欲力从客体的退回，一种价值从客体向主观抽象内容的回流。这样，在我看来，抽象作用相当于一种对客体价值的能量的贬低。换句话说，抽象作用是一种内倾的欲力运动（参见“内倾”条）。

I call an *attitude* (q.v.) *abstractive* when it is both introverting and at the same time *assimilates* (q.v.) a portion of the object, felt to be essential, to abstract contents already constellated in the subject. The more abstract a content is, the more it is *irrepresentable*. I subscribe to Kant’s view that a concept gets more abstract “the more the differences of things are left out of it,” in the sense that abstraction at its highest level detaches itself absolutely from the object, thereby attaining the extreme limit of irrepresentability. It is this pure “abstract” which I term an *idea* (q.v.). Conversely, an abstract that still possesses some degree of representability or plasticity is a *concrete*concept (v. *Concretism*).

当一种态度（参见“态度”条）既是内倾的，同时又同化了被认为是本质的客体的某些部分，并把其抽象的内容聚集于主体之中时，我就称它为抽象的态度。一种内容越是抽象，它就越是难以表现出来。我赞同康德的观点，概念越是抽象，“它就越是排除事物的差异”，在这个意义上，最高层次的抽象是与客体的绝对脱离，从而达到不可表现的极限。这就是纯粹的“抽象”，我称之为观念（参见“观念”条）。反之，一种仍然具有某种程度的可表现性或可塑性的抽象是一个具体的概念（参见“具体主义”条）。

## 2. 感情 (affect)

By the term affect I mean a state of feeling characterized by marked physical innervation on the one hand and a peculiar disturbance of the ideational process on the other. I use *emotion* as synonymous with affect. I distinguish—in contrast to Bleuler (v. *Affectivity)—feeling*(q.v.) from affect, in spite of the fact that the dividing line is fluid, since every feeling, after attaining a certain strength, releases physical innervations, thus becoming an affect. For practical reasons, however, it is advisable to distinguish affect from feeling, since feeling can be a voluntarily disposable function, whereas affect is usually not. Similarly, affect is clearly distinguished from feeling by quite perceptible physical innervations, while feeling for the most part lacks them, or else their intensity is so slight that they can be demonstrated only by the most delicate instruments, as in the case of psychogalvanic phenomena. Affect becomes cumulative through the sensation of the physical innervations released by it. This observation gave rise to the James-Lange theory of affect, which derives affect causally from physical innervations. As against this extreme view, I regard affect on the one hand as a psychic feeling-state and on the other as a physiological innervation-state, each of which has a cumulative, reciprocal effect on the other. That is to say, a component of sensation allies itself with the intensified feeling, so that the affect is approximated more to *sensation* (q.v.) and essentially differentiated from the feeling-state. Pronounced affects, i.e., affects accompanied by violent physical innervations, I do not assign to the province of feeling but to that of the sensation function.

我所谓的感情一词是指这样一种情感状态：它一方面具有显著的身体上的神经刺激的特征，另一方面则是对观念作用过程的一种特殊的扰乱。我把情绪（emotion）作为感情的同义词，而把情感（feeling）与感情区别开来——这与布留勒尔（Bleuler）正相反（参见“感触性”条），尽管事实上没有明确的界限存在，因为每一种情感在获得某种力量后就会释放出生理性的神经刺激，因而变成一种感情。不过，在实际运用中，把感情与情感区分开来却是恰当的，因为情感是一种自主的可供支配的功能，而感情则通常并非如此。同样，感情与情感明显的区别在于它能清楚地知觉到身体上的神经刺激，而情感却在很大程度上知觉不到它们，或者说它们的心理强度太过于微弱，以致只有最精密的仪器才能证实它们的存在，例如像在心理电流（psychogalvanic）的现象中那样。感情通过对身体上所释放出来的神经刺激的感觉而逐渐积累起来。这种观察产生了詹姆斯-朗格（James-Lang）的感情理论，该理论认为感情有时源于身体方面的神经刺激。与这种极端的观点相对，我一方面把感情视为心理上的情感状态，另一方面则视为生理上的神经刺激状态，两者具有积累的和相互影响的作用。也就是说，感觉的成分与强化了的情感结合起来了，由此，感情更接近于感觉了（参见“感觉”条），因而从根本上区别于情感-状态。我并没有把显著的感情，即那种伴随着激烈的生理上的神经刺激的感情归属到情感的领域，而是将之归于感觉功能的方面。

## 3. 感触性 (affectivity)

AFFECTIVITY is a term coined by Bleuler. It designates and comprises “not only the affects proper, but also the slight feelings or feeling-tones of pain and pleasure.” Bleuler distinguishes affectivity from the sense-perceptions and physical sensations as well as from “feelings” that may be regarded as inner perception processes (e.g., the “feeling” of certainty, of probability, etc.) or vague thoughts or discernments.

感触性一词系布留勒尔所创造。它所意指和包含的“不仅是感情本身，而且也是细微的情感或痛苦与快乐的情感-色调”。一方面，布留勒尔把感触性与感官-知觉及其他身体感觉区别开来；另一方面，又把它与可能被视为内在知觉过程的“情感”（例如某种确定性的“情感”、可能性的“情感”，等等）或模糊的想法、察觉等区别开来。

## 4. 阿尼玛/阿尼姆斯 (anima/animus)

参见“灵魂”（soul）、“灵魂意象”（soul-image）条。

## 5.统觉 (apperception)

APPERCEPTION is a psychic process by which a new content is articulated with similar, already existing contents in such a way that it becomes understood, apprehended, or “clear.” We distinguish *active* from *passive*apperception. The first is a process by which the subject, of his own accord and from his own motives, consciously apprehends a new content with attention and assimilates it to other contents already constellated; the second is a process by which a new content forces itself upon consciousness either from without (through the senses) or from within (from the unconscious) and, as it were, compels attention and enforces apprehension. In the first case the activity lies with the *ego* (q.v.); in the second, with the self-enforcing new content.

统觉是一种心理过程，由此过程，一种新内容以一种使其变得可以理解、可以领悟或“变得清晰”的方式与相类似的已经存在的内容连接起来了。我们对主动的和被动的统觉做了区分。前者是这样的过程，即主体自发地从他自身的动机出发，有意识地和专注地领悟到一种新内容，并且使它与另一种早就储备好的内容同化起来；后者的过程则是，一种来自外部（通过感觉）或来自内部（从无意识中）的新内容闯入了意识，也就是说，强行引起意识的注意和理解。在前一种状况中，活动的重点在于自我方面（参见“自我”条）；而在后一种情形下，活动的重点则在自行闯入的新内容方面。

## 6. 古代式 (archaism)

ARCHAISM is a term by which I designate the “oldness” of psychic contents or *functions* (q.v.). By this I do not mean qualities that are “archaistic” in the sense of being pseudo-antique or copied, as in later Roman sculpture or nineteenth-century Gothic, but qualities that have the character of *relics*. We may describe as archaic all psychological traits that exhibit the qualities of the primitive mentality. It is clear that archaism attaches primarily to the *fantasies* (q.v.) of the unconscious, i.e., to the products of unconscious fantasy activity which reach consciousness. An *image* (q.v.) has an archaic quality when it possesses unmistakable mythological parallels. Archaic, too, are the associations-by-analogy of unconscious fantasy, and so is their symbolism (v. *Symbol*). The relation of *identity* (q.v.) with an object, or *participation mystique* (q.v.), is likewise archaic. *Concretism* (q.v.) of thought and feeling is archaic; also compulsion and inability to control oneself (ecstatic or trance states, possession, etc.). Fusion of the psychological functions (v. *Differentiation*), of thinking with feeling, feeling with sensation, feeling with intuition, and so on, is archaic, as is also the fusion of part of a function with its counterpart, e.g., positive with negative feeling, or what Bleuler calls ambitendency and ambivalence, and such phenomena as *colour hearing*.

古代式一词我意指心理内容或心理功能的“古老性”。对此我并非意指“古风的”（archaistic），即不是指拟古的或仿古的，例如像罗马后期的雕刻艺术或19世纪的“哥德式”建筑所展示的那样，而是指具有遗迹（relics）特征的那种性质。所有那些呈现出原初心灵性质的心理特征，我们都可将其描述为古代的。显然，古代式主要附属于无意识的幻想，即附属于达到意识层面的无意识幻想活动的产品。当意象具有无可置疑的神话类似物时，它的性质就是古代的。无意识幻想的类比联想（associations-by-analogy）也是古代的，它们的象征方法（参见“象征”条）同样如此。与客体的同一关系或者神秘参与（参阅该条）同样是古代的。思想和情感的具体化是古代的；强迫症（compulsion）和失去自我控制能力（如迷狂或恍惚状态、着魔等等）也是古代的。诸心理功能的融合（参见“分化”条）是古代的——例如，思维与情感、情感与感觉、情感与直觉等等的融合都是古代的。另外，一种功能中某个部分与其相对部分的融合也是古代的，如肯定的情感与否定的情感的融合，或者如布留勒尔所说的自我矛盾倾向（ambitendency）和两向性（ambivalence）以及色彩听觉（colour hearing）之类现象。

### 6a.原型 (archetype)：参见“意象”、“原初的”及“观念”条。

## 7.同化 (assimilation)

ASSIMILATION is the approximation of a new content of consciousness to already constellated subjective material, the similarity of the new content to this material being especially accentuated in the process, often to the detriment of its independent qualities. Fundamentally, assimilation is a process of *apperception* (q.v.), but is distinguished from apperception by this element of approximation to the subjective material. It is in this sense that Wundt says:

同化是把一种新的意识内容吸收和归入已经聚集起来了的主观材料中，在此过程中，新的内容和这种材料之间的相似性受到了特别的强调，以致常常损害了新内容的独立性质。从根本上看，同化是一个统觉的过程，但是由于它强调与主观材料的近似性因素而同统觉相区别。正是在这个意义上冯特说：

This way of building up ideas \[i.e., by assimilation\] is most conspicuous when the assimilating elements arise through reproduction, and the assimilated ones through an immediate sense impression. For then the elements of memory-images are projected, as it were, into the external object, so that, particularly when the object and the reproduced elements differ substantially from one another, the finished sense impression appears as an illusion, deceiving us as to the real nature of things.

当同化的因素通过再建（reproduction）、被同化的因素通过直接的感觉印象出现时，这种观念建立的方式（即同化）就显得再明显不过了。因为这时记忆-意象的因素被投射到外在客体，以致——尤其当客体与再建的因素相互之间存在实质性的差异时——完成的感觉印象会显得好像是幻相，对我们隐匿了事物的真实本质。

I use the term assimilation in a somewhat broader sense, as the approximation of object to subject in general, and with it I contrast *dissimilation*, as the approximation of subject to object, and a consequent alienation of the subject from himself in favour of the object, whether it be an external object or a “psychological” object, for instance an idea.

我则是在较为广泛的意义上使用同化的概念，即一般说来指客体向主体的接近，我用它来与异化（dissimilation）相对照，异化表示主体向客体的接近，以致主体为了迎合客体而同他自身疏离，无论是迎合外在客体还是迎合诸如观念之类的“心理的”客体。

## 8.态度 (attitude)

This concept is a relatively recent addition to psychology. It originated with Müller and Schumann.Whereas Külpe defines attitude as a predisposition of the sensory or motor centres to react to a particular stimulus or constant impulse, Ebbinghaus conceives it in a wider sense as an effect of training which introduces the factor of habit into individual acts that deviate from the habitual. Our use of the concept derives from Ebbinghaus’s. For us, attitude is a readiness of the psyche to act or react in a certain way. The concept is of particular importance for the psychology of complex psychic processes because it expresses the peculiar fact that certain stimuli have too strong an effect on some occasions, and little or no effect on others. To have an attitude means to be ready for something definite, even though this something is unconscious; for having an attitude is synonymous with an *a priori* orientation to a definite thing, no matter whether this be represented in consciousness or not. The state of readiness, which I conceive attitude to be, consists in the presence of a certain subjective constellation, a definite combination of psychic factors or contents, which will either determine action in this or that definite direction, or react to an external stimulus in a definite way. Active *apperception*(q.v.) is impossible without an attitude. An attitude always has a point of reference; this can be either conscious or unconscious, for in the act of apperceiving a new content an already constellated combination of contents will inevitably accentuate those qualities or elements that appear to belong to the subjective content. Hence a selection or judgment takes place which excludes anything irrelevant. As to what is or is not relevant, this is decided by the already constellated combination of contents. Whether the point of reference is conscious or unconscious does not affect the selectivity of the attitude, since the selection is implicit in the attitude and takes place automatically. It is useful, however, to distinguish between the two, because the presence of two attitudes is extremely frequent, one conscious and the other unconscious. This means that consciousness has a constellation of contents different from that of the unconscious, a duality particularly evident in neurosis.

相对而言，这一概念是心理学新近才获得的。它起源于穆勒（Müller）和舒曼（Schumann）。库尔普（Külpe）把态度界定为感觉中枢或运动中枢对特殊刺激或持久冲动做出反应的一种预感，相反，艾宾霍斯（Ebbinghaus）则在更广泛的意义上把它理解为一种训练的结果，它把习惯性因素引进了偏离惯常的个别行为中。我们对此概念的运用源自艾宾霍斯。在我们看来，态度是以某种方式行动或作出反应的心理准备状态。确实，对复杂心理现象的心理学来说，这一概念是十分重要的，因为它表达了以下特殊事实：为什么某种刺激在某些时刻会产生十分强烈的影响，而在另一时刻它们的影响却又十分微弱甚或全无。具有某种态度也就意味着对某一特定事物做好了准备，即使这一特定事物是意识的也是如此；因为具有一种态度就预示着有了一个朝向某一特定事物的先天的定向，而无论其是否呈现于意识中都是如此。我将态度视为一种准备状态，它总是存在于某种主观的心理集束中，存在于心理因素或心理内容的特定组合中，它们既可以此决定行为、确定行为的方向，也可以某种确定的方式对外部刺激做出反应。积极的统觉不可能没有态度。态度总是具有一个控制点；它既可以是意识的又可以是无意识的，因为在统觉一种新的内容的行为中，一个已经聚集起来的内容组合体将不断地强调那些显然属于主观内容的品质和要素。因此选择或判断就出现在排除任何不相干的东西的地方。至于什么是相干的、什么是不相干的，则由已经聚集起来的内容的组合体来决定。无论这个控制点是意识的还是无意识的都不会影响到态度的选择，因为选择已内在于态度中，已自主地出现了。然而，把意识与无意识区别开来是有意义的，因为这两种态度——意识的与无意识的——出现极为频繁。这就意味着意识所聚集起来的内容不同于无意识所聚集起来的内容，某种双重现象尤其出现在心理症中。

The concept of attitude has some affinity with Wundt’s concept of *apperception*, with the difference that apperception includes the process of relating the already constellated contents to the new content to be apperceived, whereas attitude relates exclusively to the subjectively constellated content. Apperception is, as it were, the bridge which connects the already existing, constellated contents with the new one, whereas attitude would be the support or abutment of the bridge on the one bank, and the new content the abutment on the other bank. Attitude signifies *expectation*, and expectation always operates selectively and with a sense of direction. The presence of a strongly feeling-toned content in the conscious field of vision forms (maybe with other contents) a particular constellation that is equivalent to a definite attitude, because such a content promotes the perception and apperception of everything similar to itself and blacks out the dissimilar. It creates an attitude that corresponds to it. This automatic phenomenon is an essential cause of the one-sidedness of conscious *orientation* (q.v.). It would lead to a complete loss of equilibrium if there were no self-regulating, compensatory (v. *Compensation*) function in the psyche to correct the conscious attitude. In this sense, therefore, the duality of attitude is a normal phenomenon, and it plays a disturbing role only when the one-sidedness is excessive.

态度的概念与冯特的统觉概念之间存在某种亲缘关系，尽管它们带有这种差异：即统觉包含把已经聚集的内容与被知觉到的新内容连接起来的过程，而态度则唯一地与从主观上聚集起来的内容相联系。可以这样说，统觉是一座桥梁，它把已经存在的聚集起来的内容与新的内容连接起来，而态度是立于河岸一端的桥梁的支撑或桥墩，新的内容则是立于河岸另一端的桥墩。态度意指期望，期望总是有选择性地起作用，具有定向的意义。一种具有强烈情感-色调的内容出现于意识的幻觉领域中时，就会形成（或许与其他内容一道）某种与特定的态度相应的特殊的心理集聚，因为这种内容促使其去知觉和统觉一切相似之物，抑制一切不同之物，它创造了一种与之相应的态度。这种自主现象是造成意识定向的片面性的根本原因。如果心理上没有自我调节的、补偿性的功能来矫正意识态度的话，就将导致心理平衡的完全丧失。因此在这个意义上，态度的双重性是一种正常现象，它仅仅在意识的片面性变得过分时才扮演一个干扰的角色。

Attitude in the sense of ordinary *attention* can be a relatively unimportant subsidiary phenomenon, but it can also be a general principle governing the whole psyche. Depending on environmental influences and on the individual’s education, general experience of life, and personal convictions, a subjective constellation of contents may be habitually present, continually moulding a certain attitude that may affect the minutest details of his life. Every man who is particularly aware of the seamy side of existence, for instance, will naturally have an attitude that is constantly on the look-out for something unpleasant. This conscious imbalance is compensated by an unconscious expectation of pleasure. Again, an oppressed person has a conscious attitude that always anticipates oppression; he selects this factor from the general run of experience and scents it out everywhere. His unconscious attitude, therefore, aims at power and superiority.

在通常的注意的意义上，态度可能是一种相对非重要的附属现象，但是它也是一种决定全部心理的普遍性原则。由于环境的影响、个体的教育程度、生活的一般经验以及个人的信念，一个主观的内容集丛可能会习惯性地出现，不断地铸造某种渗透到其生命的最微小的细节的态度。例如，每一个对生存的阴暗面具有特殊感受的人自然会对不愉快的事情保持一种经常戒备的态度。这种意识的不平衡为一种无意识的对快乐的期望所补偿。此外，一个遭受压抑的人具有一种总是期待压抑的意识态度；他从常有的经验之流中挑选这种因素，似乎在任何地方都能感受到它。所以他的无意识态度的目标显得更有力量和更具优势。

The whole psychology of an individual even in its most fundamental features is oriented in accordance with his habitual attitude. Although the general psychological laws operate in every individual, they cannot be said to be characteristic of a particular individual, since the way they operate varies in accordance with his habitual attitude. The habitual attitude is always a resultant of all the factors that exert a decisive influence on the psyche, such as innate disposition, environmental influences, experience of life, insights and convictions gained through *differentiation*(q.v.), *collective* (q.v.) views, etc. Were it not for the absolutely fundamental importance of attitude, the existence of an individual psychology would be out of the question. But the habitual attitude brings about such great displacements of energy, and so modifies the relations between the individual *functions* (q.v.), that effects are produced which often cast doubt on the validity of general psychological laws. In spite of the fact, for instance, that some measure of sexual activity is held to be indispensable on physiological and psychological grounds, there are individuals who, without loss to themselves, i.e., without pathological effects or any demonstrable restriction of their powers, can, to a very great extent, dispense with it, while in other cases quite insignificant disturbances in this area can have far-reaching consequences. How enormous the individual differences are can be seen most clearly, perhaps, in the question of likes and dislikes. Here practically all rules go by the board. What is there, in the last resort, that has not at some time given man pleasure, and what is there that has not caused him pain? Every instinct, every function can be subordinated to another. The ego instinct or power instinct can make sexuality its servant, or sexuality can exploit the ego. Thinking may overrun everything else, or feeling swallow up thinking and sensation, all depending on the attitude.

个体的全部心理即使具有其最基本的特征，但仍然趋向于同他的习惯性态度保持一致。虽然普遍的心理规律对每一个个体起作用，但并不能就把它们当成是个体的特征，因为根据他的习惯性态度它们发挥作用的方式是多种多样的。习惯性态度总是所有能对心理施加根本性影响的因素的结果，诸如先天的性格、环境的影响、生活的经验、通过分化而获得的洞察力和说服力、集体的观念，等等。倘若没有态度这种绝对不可或缺的重要性，那么个体心理的存在就是成问题的。但是习惯性态度引起了如此巨大的能量置换，如此地改变了个体功能之间的关系，以致产生了这样的结果，人们对普遍的心理学规律的有效性深感疑虑。例如，某种程度的性活动无论在生理基础上还是在心理基础上都被认为是必不可少的，然而尽管事实如此，但仍然存在这样的个体，他们没有伤害自身而生存下来了，既没有病理现象，也没有任何明显的对他们的能力的限制，而在相当大的程度上，他们可以省却这些性活动；但在另一种情形下，这方面的极轻微的扰乱都可能引发极其可怕的后果。个体所具有的差异之巨大，或许可以在喜欢还是反感之类问题上看得非常清楚。在这里，实际上所有的规律都被抛弃了。那么最后剩下来的难道是那种在这一次没有给人以快乐的东西吗？难道是那种并没有造成他的痛苦的东西吗？每一种本能、每一种功能都可能屈从于其他的本能和其他的功能。自我本能或权力本能（power instinct）都能使性欲成为它的仆人，而性欲也能奴役自我。思维可以掌控一切，情感也可吞没思维与感觉，这一切全都依赖于态度。

At bottom, attitude is an individual phenomenon that eludes scientific investigation. In actual experience, however, certain typical attitudes can be distinguished in so far as certain psychic functions can be distinguished. When a function habitually predominates, a typical attitude is produced. According to the nature of the differentiated function, there will be constellations of contents that create a corresponding attitude. There is thus a typical thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuitive attitude. Besides these purely psychological attitudes, whose number might very well be increased, there are also social attitudes, namely, those on which a collective idea has set its stamp. They are characterized by the various “-isms.” These collective attitudes are very important, in some cases even outweighing the importance of the individual attitude.

实质上，态度是一种个体现象，无法为科学研究所理解。不过，在实际经验中，某些态度类型，就其某些心理功能可以被区分而言则是可能被区分的。当一种功能习惯性地占据优势时，一种态度类型（typical attitude）就产生了。根据不同功能的性质，就会存在某种心理内容的集丛，也就形成了相应的态度。因而存在着思维、情感、感觉和直觉态度的类型。除了这些纯粹的心理态度——它们的数量或许会增加——之外，还存在着社会性的态度，即那些打上了集体观念的烙印的人。他们以各种各样的“主义”为特征。这些集体性的态度是非常重要的，在某些情况下，它们甚至比个体态度还更为重要。

## 9.集体性的 (collective)

I term *collective* all psychic contents that belong not to one individual but to many, i.e., to a society, a people, or to mankind in general. Such contents are what Lévy-Bruhl calls the *représentations collectives*of primitives, as well as general concepts of justice, the state, religion, science, etc., current among civilized man. It is not only concepts and ways of looking at things, however, that must be termed collective, but also *feelings*. Among primitives, the *représentations collectives* are at the same time collective feelings, as Lévy-Bruhl has shown. Because of this collective feeling-value he calls the *représentations collectives* “mystical,” since they are not merely intellectual but emotional. Among civilized peoples, too, certain collective ideas—God, justice, fatherland, etc.—are bound up with collective feelings. This collective quality adheres not only to particular psychic elements or contents but to whole *functions* (q.v.). Thus the thinking function as a whole can have a collective quality, when it possesses general validity and accords with the laws of logic. Similarly, the feeling function as a whole can be collective, when it is identical with the general feeling and accords with general expectations, the general moral consciousness, etc. In the same way, sensation and intuition are collective when they are at the same time characteristic of a large group of men. The antithesis of collective is *individual* (q.v.).

我所称为集体性的，是指所有那些并不单属某个人，而是属于许多人，即属于社会、民族或一般人类的心理内容。这样的内容被列维-布留尔描述为原初人的集体表象（représentations collectives），它们包括流行于文明人中的诸如正义、国家、宗教、科学等一般性概念。然而，并非只有概念和看待事物的方法才被称为集体性的，此外还有情感。正如列维-布留尔所表明的，在原初人中，集体表象同时也是集体情感。由于其集体性的情感-价值，他把集体表象称之为“神秘的”，因为它们并非纯粹是理智性的，而且也是感情的。在文明人那里，某种集体观念——上帝、正义、祖国——也与集体情感有着密切的联系。这种集体属性不仅附着于个别的心理因素，而且附着于整个心理功能。因此，思维功能当其具有普遍的有效性、与逻辑规律相一致时，它就整体上具有了集体性的特征。同样地，当情感功能与一般的情感相等同、与普遍的经验、普遍的道德良知等相一致时，它也就整体上是集体性的。同样的道理，当感觉和直觉同时具有大多数人的特征时，它们便是集体性的。集体性的对立面即是个体性的。

## 10. 补偿 (compensation)

COMPENSATION means *balancing, adjusting, supplementing*. The concept was introduced into the psychology of the neuroses by Adler. He understands by it the functional balancing of the feeling of inferiority by a compensatory psychological system, comparable to the compensatory development of organs in organ inferiority.He says:

补偿意味着平衡、调节或补充。这个概念被阿德勒（Adler）引入到心理症的心理学中，阿德勒把补偿理解为通过补偿性心理系统对自卑感所作的功能平衡，它类似于器官处于低下状态时器官的补偿性发展。阿德勒说：

With the breaking away from the maternal organism the struggle with the outer world begins for these inferior organs and organ systems, a struggle which must necessarily break out and declare itself with greater violence than in a normally developed apparatus. … Nevertheless, the foetal character supplies at the same time the heightened possibility of compensation and overcompensation, increases the capacity for adaptation to usual and unusual resistance, and ensures the development of new and higher forms, of new and higher achievements.

对这些低等器官和器官系统来说，与外部世界的冲突始于脱离母体器官的时候，这种冲突必然会触发，而且比发生在较为正常发育的器官中的冲突更为激烈……然而，胎儿的特性也同时为补偿与过度补偿提供了更大的可能性，增进了适应正常的抵抗与非正常的抵抗的能力，从而确保获得更新和更高形式的发展，取得更新和更高的成就。

The neurotic’s feeling of inferiority, which according to Adler corresponds aetiologically to an organ inferiority, gives rise to an “auxiliary device,” that is, a compensation, which consists in the setting up of a “guiding fiction” to balance the inferiority. The “guiding fiction” is a psychological system that endeavours to turn an inferiority into a superiority. The significant thing about this conception is the undeniable and empirically demonstrable existence of a compensating function in the sphere of psychological processes. It corresponds to a similar function in the physiological sphere, namely, the self-regulation of the living organism.

按照阿德勒的理论，在病原学上与器官低下状态相对应的心理症患者的自卑感将产生一种“辅助性装置”，即补偿，它在于设置了一条“虚构的引导线路”（fctitious guiding line）来平衡自卑。这种“虚构的引导线路”是一个努力将自卑转变为优越的心理系统。该概念的重要处在于，补偿性功能在心理过程方面是毋庸置疑地存在着的，并且在经验上是可以证实的。它与生理学领域中的类似功能，即生命有机体的自我调节相对应。

Whereas Adler restricts his concept of compensation to the balancing of inferiority feelings, I conceive it as functional adjustment in general, an inherent self-regulation of the psychic apparatus. In this sense, I regard the activity of the *unconscious* (q.v.) as a balancing of the one-sidedness of the general *attitude* (q.v.) produced by the function of *consciousness* (q.v.). Psychologists often compare consciousness to the eye: we speak of a visual field and a focal point of consciousness. The nature of consciousness is aptly characterized by this simile: only a limited number of contents can be held in the conscious field at the same time, and of these only a few can attain the highest grade of consciousness. The activity of consciousness is *selective*. Selection demands *direction*. But direction requires the *exclusion of everything irrelevant*. This is bound to make the conscious *orientation* (q.v.) one-sided. The contents that are excluded and inhibited by the chosen direction sink into the unconscious, where they form a counterweight to the conscious orientation. The strengthening of this counterposition keeps pace with the increase of conscious one-sidedness until finally a noticeable tension is produced. This tension inhibits the activity of consciousness to a certain extent, and though at first the inhibition can be broken down by increased conscious effort, in the end the tension becomes so acute that the repressed unconscious contents break through in the form of dreams and spontaneous *images* (q.v.). The more one-sided the conscious attitude, the more antagonistic are the contents arising from the unconscious, so that we may speak of a real opposition between the two. In this case the compensation appears in the form of a counter-function, but this case is extreme. As a rule, the unconscious compensation does not run counter to consciousness, but is rather a balancing or supplementing of the conscious orientation. In dreams, for instance, the unconscious supplies all those contents that are constellated by the conscious situation but are inhibited by conscious selection, although a knowledge of them would be indispensable for complete adaptation.

然而，阿德勒把他的补偿概念限制在自卑感的平衡上，但我把它理解为一般性的功能调节，一种心理机制的内在的自我调节。在这个意义上，我把无意识活动看作对意识功能所产生的一般态度的片面性的一种平衡。心理学家常常把意识比喻为眼睛：我们常谈及意识的视野与焦点。这个比喻极贴切地显示了意识的本质特征：仅有极少数的内容能同时在意识的视野里被掌握，而其中能达到意识的最高程度者更是少之又少。意识的活动是选择，选择则要求定向（direction）。而定向要求排除不相干的一切。这就必然使意识的定向趋于片面性。那些为已经选择的定向所排除的和抑制的内容就沉入了无意识，它们在此形成对意识定向的抗衡力量。这一相反阵营的增强与意识片面性的强化保持着平衡，直到最后激烈的心理紧张产生为止。这种紧张将意识活动抑制在某种程度上，虽然最初其抑制可能被日益增强的意识的努力所打破。但是最终的结果却是，心理紧张变得如此激烈，以致被压抑的无意识内容以梦幻与自发意象的形式爆发出来。意识的态度越是片面，来自无意识的内容的对抗就越是强烈，以致我们可以说这是两者之间的真正的对抗。处于这种情形下，补偿便以对立功能的形式出现了，但这是极端的情形。通常，无意识的补偿并不与意识相对立，而更多的是对意识定向的平衡或补充。例如在梦中，无意识提供了全部处于意识情境下搜集到的但却为意识的选择所抑制的内容，尽管知悉这些内容对于完满的适应来说是必不可少的。

Normally, compensation is an unconscious process, i.e., an unconscious regulation of conscious activity. In neurosis the unconscious appears in such stark contrast to the conscious state that compensation is disturbed. The aim of analytical therapy, therefore, is a realization of unconscious contents in order that compensation may be re-established.

在正常情况下，补偿是一个无意识的过程，即对意识活动的一种无意识的调节。在心理症的状况下，无意识出现在与意识如此尖锐对立的情形下，以致补偿作用被扰乱了。因此，分析疗法的目的在于，能充分认识到无意识的内容，以便补偿作用可能重建起来。

## 11. 具体化 (concretism)

By this I mean a peculiarity of thinking and feeling which is the antithesis of *abstraction* (q.v.). The actual meaning of *concrete* is “grown together.” A concretely thought concept is one that has grown together or coalesced with other concepts. Such a concept is not abstract, not segregated, not thought “in itself,” but is always alloyed and related to something else. It is not a differentiated concept, but is still embedded in the material transmitted by sense-perception. Concretistic *thinking* (q.v.) operates exclusively with concrete concepts and percepts, and is constantly related to *sensation* (q.v.). Similarly, concretistic *feeling* (q.v.) is never segregated from its sensuous context.

具体化指思维和情感的一种与抽象作用相对立的特性。具体化的实际意义是“共同生长”（grown together）。一个具体思维的概念即是一个与其他概念共同生长或相互结合的概念。这种概念不是抽象的、封闭的和“内在于自身中”的思想，而总是与别的概念相融合的和相互关联的。它不是一种已分化的概念，而仍然置身于感官-知觉所传达的材料中。具体化的思维无一例外地与具体概念及其知觉对象一起运作，总是保持与感觉的联系。同样地，具体化的情感也从未脱离与感官的联系。

Primitive thinking and feeling are entirely concretistic; they are always related to sensation. The thought of the primitive has no detached independence but clings to material phenomena. It rises at most to the level of *analogy*. Primitive feeling is equally bound to material phenomena. Both of them depend on sensation and are only slightly differentiated from it. Concretism, therefore, is an *archaism*(q.v.). The magical influence of the fetish is not experienced as a subjective state of feeling, but sensed as a magical effect. That is concretistic feeling. The primitive does not experience the idea of divinity as a subjective content; for him the sacred tree is the abode of the god, or even the god himself. That is concretistic thinking. In civilized man, concretistic thinking consists in the inability to conceive of anything except immediately obvious facts transmitted by the senses, or in the inability to discriminate between subjective feeling and the sensed object.

原初思维和情感完全是具体化的；它们总是与感觉联系在一起。原初人的思想从没有超然的独立性，而是紧紧依附于物质现象。它充其量能达到类比（analogy）的层面。原初情感也同样局限于物质现象。它们都依赖于感觉，其中仅仅有微弱的分化。因此，具体化是古代式的（参阅该条）。物神（fetish）的魔力影响并不能体验为一种主观的情感状况，而是被感觉为一种魔力效应。这便是情感的具体化。原初人并不把神性观念体验为一种主观内容；在他看来，圣树即是神的居所，甚至就是神本身。这便是具体化的思维。在文明人那里，具体化的思维在于除了感官所传达的直接而明显的事实外，无法设想任何其他东西，或者无法将主观情感与被感觉的对象区分开来。

Concretism is a concept which falls under the more general concept of *participation mystique* (q.v.). Just as the latter represents a fusion of the individual with external objects, concretism represents a fusion of thinking and feeling with sensation, so that the object of one is at the same time the object of the other. This fusion prevents any differentiation of thinking and feeling and keeps them both within the sphere of sensation; they remain its servants and can never be developed into pure functions. The result is a predominance of the sensation factor in psychological *orientation* (q.v.). (Concerning the importance of this factor, v. *Sensation*.)

具体化是一个列于更普遍的概念神秘参与之下的概念。正像“神秘参与”呈现出个体与外在对象的融合一样，具体化表现了思维、情感与感觉的融合，所以思维和情感的对象同时也是感觉对象。这种融合避免了思维和情感的分化，使它们保留在感觉的领域中；它们仍然是感觉的奴仆，而未发展成为纯粹的功能。结果是感觉因素在心理定向上处于优势地位。（有关感觉因素的重要性见“感觉”条。）

The disadvantage of concretism is the subjection of the functions to sensation. Because sensation is the perception of physiological stimuli, concretism either rivets the function to the sensory sphere or constantly leads back to it. This results in a bondage of the psychological functions to the senses, favouring the influence of sensuous facts at the expense of the psychic independence of the individual. So far as the recognition of facts is concerned this orientation is naturally of value, but not as regards the *interpretation* of facts and their relation to the individual. Concretism sets too high a value on the importance of facts and suppresses the freedom of the individual for the sake of objective data. But since the individual is conditioned not merely by physiological stimuli but by factors which may even be opposed to external realities, concretism results in a *projection* (q.v.) of these inner factors into the objective data and produces an almost superstitious veneration of mere facts, as is precisely the case with the primitive. A good example of concretistic feeling is seen in the excessive importance which Nietzsche attached to diet, and in the materialism of Moleschott (“Man is what he eats”). An example of the superstitious overvaluation of facts would be the hypostatizing of the concept of energy in Ostwald’s monism.

具体化的不利方面在于诸功能对感觉的从属地位。因为感觉是对生理刺激的知觉，具体化不是要求把功能固定于感官的领域内，就是不断地把它领回到那里。结果造成了一种心理功能对感官的从属性，以损害个体心理自主性来迎合感官事实的影响。就对相关的事实的认识而言，这种定向自然是有价值的，但是，就对事实进行解释和阐释它们与个体关系而言就并非如此了。具体化赋予事实的重要性以太高的价值，为了有利于客观材料而压抑了个体的自由。但是，既然个体并非仅仅受制于生理的刺激，而且也可能受制于那些与外在现实相对立的因素，那么具体化就起到了把这些内在因素投射到客观材料中去的作用，由此产生出对纯粹事实近乎迷信的崇拜，这与原初人的情形丝毫无异。在尼采那里有一个很突出的例子可以证明：他的情感的具体化导致一种对饮食的过高评价，摩莱斯各特（Maleschott）的唯物主义是同样的例子——“人即他的所食之物”。对事实近乎迷信的过高评价的例证还有奥斯特瓦尔德一元论中对能量概念的实体化（hypostasizing）。

## 12. 意识 (consciousness)

By consciousness I understand the relation of psychic contents to the *ego* (q.v.), in so far as this relation is perceived as such by the ego. Relations to the ego that are not perceived as such are *unconscious*(q.v.). Consciousness is the function or activity which maintains the relation of psychic contents to the ego. Consciousness is not identical with the *psyche* (v. *Soul*), because the psyche represents the totality of all psychic contents, and these are not necessarily all directly connected with the ego, i.e., related to it in such a way that they take on the quality of consciousness. A great many psychic complexes exist which are not all necessarily connected with the ego.

我把意识理解为心理内容与自我的关系，就这种关系如此这般地为自我所知觉而言。而如此这般地不能知觉到这种与自我的关系的则是无意识。意识是维持心理内容与自我的关系的功能或活动。意识并不等同于心理（psyche，参见“灵魂”条），因为心理代表所有心理内容的总和，它们并非必然完全直接地关联于自我，或者说它们采取一种意识性的方式与自我相联系。这里存在着众多的心理情结，但并非必然地都与自我相联系。

## 13. 建构 (constructive)

This concept is used by me in an equivalent sense to *synthetic*, almost in fact as an illustration of it. Constructive means “building up.” I use *constructive*and *synthetic* to designate a method that is the antithesis of the *reductive* (q.v.). The constructive method is concerned with the elaboration of the products of the unconscious (dreams, fantasies, etc.; v. *Fantasy*). It takes the unconscious product as a symbolic expression (v. *Symbol*) which anticipates a coming phase of psychological development. Maeder actually speaks of a *prospective function* of the *unconscious* (q.v.), which half playfully anticipates future developments. Adler, too, recognizes an anticipatory function of the unconscious. It is certain that the product of the unconscious cannot be regarded as a finished thing, as a sort of end-product, for that would be to deny it any purposive significance. Freud himself allows the dream a teleological role at least as the “guardian of sleep,” though for him its prospective function is essentially restricted to “wishing.” The purposive character of unconscious tendencies cannot be contested *a priori* if we are to accept their analogy with other psychological or physiological functions. We conceive the product of the unconscious, therefore, as an expression oriented to a goal or purpose, but characterizing its objective in symbolic language.

我在与综合（synthetic）同义的意义上来使用这个概念，实际上它近乎是对综合概念的一种图解。建构意指“建立起来”（building up）。我用建构与综合来意指一种与还原（reductive，参见该条）相对立的方法。建构的方法所涉及的是无意识产品的精心编构（梦、幻想等，参见“幻想”条）。它把无意识的产品当作一种象征性的（参见“象征”条）的表达，它预示着一种正在到来的心理发展阶段。就此而言，麦德尔（Maeder）正确地论述了无意识的预测功能（prospective function，参见该条），这种功能半戏谑性地（hall playfully）预测了未来的发展。阿德勒也认识到了无意识的预期性的功能。确实，无意识的产品不能视为一种完成了的或终结了的产品，因为这将否认它具有任何目的性（purposive）的意义。弗洛伊德也赞同梦至少扮演了像“睡眠的保护者”那样的目的论的角色，尽管在他看来梦的预测功能基本上被限制在“愿望”上。如果我们承认无意识倾向与其他心理功能或生理功能相类似的话，那么其目的性的特征就不具有先天性了。因此，我们把无意识的产品设想为是定向于某一目标或某一目的的表达，不过它是以象征的语言来凸显其目的的。

In accordance with this conception, the constructive method of interpretation is not so much concerned with the primary sources of the unconscious product, with its raw materials, so to speak, as with bringing its symbolism to a general and comprehensible expression. The “free associations” of the subject are considered with respect to their aim and not with respect to their derivation. They are viewed from the angle of future action or inaction; at the same time, their relation to the conscious situation is carefully taken into account, for, according to the *compensation* (q.v.) theory, the activity of the unconscious has an essentially complementary significance for the conscious situation. Since it is a question of an anticipatory *orientation* (q.v.), the actual relation to the object does not loom so large as in the reductive procedure, which is concerned with actual relations to the object in the past. It is more a question of the subjective *attitude* (q.v.), the object being little more than a signpost pointing to the tendencies of the subject. The aim of the constructive method, therefore, is to elicit from the unconscious product a meaning that relates to the subject’s future attitude. Since, as a rule, the unconscious can create only symbolic expressions, the constructive method seeks to elucidate the symbolically expressed meaning in such a way as to indicate how the conscious orientation may be corrected, and how the subject may act in harmony with the unconscious.

根据这种观点，用于阐释的建构的方法所涉及的，与其说是无意识产品的原初根源，或者说无意识产品的原始材料，倒不如说是将这种象征产物带入到一种普遍的和可理解的表现形式中去。因此，主体的“自由联想”就被认为是着眼于它们的目的，而并非着眼于它们的根源的。必须从未来的行动或不行动这一角度来看待它们；同时，也必须十分谨慎地考虑它们与意识情境的关系，这是因为，根据补偿的理论，无意识的活动对于意识情境具有一种实质性的补充的意义。既然这是一个预期的定向的问题，那么与客体的实际关系就不会像在还原的过程中那样显得突出，它涉及到与处于过去中的客体的实际关系。因而这更多的是一个主观态度的问题，客体充其量只是显示主观倾向的信号。因此，建构方法的目的在于从无意识产品中引发出某种与主体未来的态度相关的意义。通常，既然无意识只能创造出象征的表达方式，那么建构的方法就在于以此努力地阐明象征性表达的意义，以便表明意识的定向是怎样得到纠正的，主体是怎样与无意识协调一致的行动的。

Thus, just as no psychological method of interpretation relies exclusively on the associative material supplied by the analysand, the constructive method also makes use of comparative material. And just as reductive interpretation employs parallels drawn from biology, physiology, folklore, literature, and other sources, the constructive treatment of an intellectual problem will make use of philosophical parallels, while the treatment of an intuitive problem will depend more on parallels from mythology and the history of religion.

因此，正像没有任何心理学的解释方法能孤立地建立在由精神分析对象所引起的联想的材料上一样，建构的方法也使用了某些比较性的材料。同样，正像还原的解释运用了来自生物学、生理学、民间传说、文学即其他方面的相关材料一样，对理智问题的建构的处理也将使用哲学方面的材料，而对于直觉问题的处理则更多地依赖于来自神话和宗教史方面的资料。

The constructive method is necessarily *individualistic*, since a future collective attitude can develop only through the individual. The reductive method, on the contrary, is *collective* (q.v.), since it leads back from the individual to basic collective attitudes or facts. The constructive method can also be directly applied by the subject to his own material, in which case it is an *intuitive* method, employed to elucidate the general meaning of an unconscious product. This elucidation is the result of an *associative* (as distinct from actively *apperceptive*, q.v.) addition of further material, which so enriches the, symbolic product (e.g., a dream) that it eventually attains a degree of clarity sufficient for conscious comprehension. It becomes interwoven with more general associations and is thereby assimilated.

既然一种未来的集体性的态度只有通过个体才能得到发展，那么建构的方法就必然是个人主义的。而相反的，既然还原的方法是从个体的态度和事实返回到集体的态度或事实，那么它就是集体性的。主体也能直接地将建构的方法运用于他自己的材料，在此情形下，它即是一种直觉的方法，用于阐明无意识产品的一般意义。这种阐明是增添了更多的材料的联想的结果（因此区别于积极的统觉，参见该条），它使象征的产品（即梦）变得如此之丰富，以致最终获得了足以为意识所理解的相当程度的清晰。它与更为普遍的联想相互交织，并由此而被同化。

## 14. 分化 (differentiation)

DIFFERENTIATION means the development of differences, the separation of parts from a whole. In this work I employ the concept of differentiation chiefly with respect to the psychological *functions* (q.v.). So long as a function is still so fused with one or more other functions—thinking with feeling, feeling with sensation, etc.—that it is unable to operate on its own, it is in an *archaic* (q.v.) condition, i.e., not differentiated, not separated from the whole as a special part and existing by itself. Undifferentiated thinking is incapable of thinking apart from other functions; it is continually mixed up with sensations, feelings, intuitions, just as undifferentiated feeling is mixed up with sensations and fantasies, as for instance in the sexualization (Freud) of feeling and thinking in neurosis. As a rule, the undifferentiated function is also characterized by ambivalence and ambitendency, i.e., every position entails its own negation, and this leads to characteristic inhibitions in the use of the undifferentiated function. Another feature is the fusing together of its separate components; thus, undifferentiated sensation is vitiated by the coalescence of different sensory spheres (colour-hearing), and undifferentiated feeling by confounding hate with love. To the extent that a function is largely or wholly unconscious, it is also undifferentiated; it is not only fused together in its parts but also merged with other functions. Differentiation consists in the separation of the function from other functions, and in the separation of its individual parts from each other. Without differentiation direction is impossible, since the direction of a function towards a goal depends on the elimination of anything irrelevant. Fusion with the irrelevant precludes direction; only a differentiated function is *capable* of being directed.

分化意味着差异的发展，指部分从整体中分离出来。在本书中，我主要把这个概念用于心理功能方面。只要一种功能仍然与另一种功能或其他更多的功能——思维与情感、情感与感觉等等——交融为一，以致它不可能单独运作，它就处在一种古代的的状况中，即是未分化的，自身没有作为一个特殊的部分和独立的存在从整体中分离出来。一种未分化的思维不可能脱离其他功能而进行思考；它总是与感觉、情感、直觉混合在一起，就正像未分化的情感与感觉和幻想混合在一起一样，这可从心理症患者的情感与思维的性欲化（弗洛伊德）上得到说明。未分化的功能通常也具有两向性和相矛盾性的特征，即每一种立场都带有其自身的否定，这导致未分化的功能在运用上受到明显的抑制。未分化功能的另一个特征在于它的各种成分的相互融合；因此，未分化的感觉会由于各种不同方面的感觉的混合（如“色彩-听觉”）而失效，未分化的情感会由于恨与爱的混淆而错乱。就一种功能主要或全部是无意识的而言，它也是未分化的；它不仅与它的组成部分相混合，而且也与其他的功能相混合。分化在于将某种功能从其他的功能中分离出来，在于将个别的组成部分从其他部分中分离出来。既然一种功能的定向有赖于排除不相干的东西，所以没有定向，分化就是不可能的。与不相干的东西的混合必然排斥定向；只有一种已分化的功能才具有定向的能力。

## 15. 异化 (dissimilation)

参见“同化”（assimilation）条。

## 16. 自我 (ego)

By ego I understand a complex of ideas which constitutes the centre of my field of consciousness and appears to possess a high degree of continuity and identity. Hence I also speak of an *ego-complex*. The ego-complex is as much a content as a condition of *consciousness* (q.v.), for a psychic element is conscious to me only in so far as it is related to my ego-complex. But inasmuch as the ego is only the centre of my field of consciousness, it is not identical with the totality of my psyche, being merely one complex among other complexes. I therefore distinguish between the ego and the *self* (q.v.), since the ego is only the subject of my consciousness, while the self is the subject of my total psyche, which also includes the unconscious. In this sense the self would be an ideal entity which embraces the ego. In unconscious *fantasies* (q.v.) the self often appears as supraordinate or ideal personality, having somewhat the relationship of Faust to Goethe or Zarathustra to Nietzsche. For the sake of idealization the archaic features of the self are represented as being separate from the “higher” self, as for instance Mephistopheles in Goethe, Epimetheus in Spitteler, and in Christian psychology the devil or Antichrist. In Nietzsche, Zarathustra discovered his shadow in the “Ugliest Man.”

我把自我理解为一种构成我的意识领域中心和呈现出具有极高的连续性与同一性的观念情结。因此我也称之为自我情结（ego complex）。自我情结是像意识状态那样的内容，因为在我看来，只要一种心理因素与我的自我情结相关联，它就是意识的。但是，由于自我只是我的意识领域的中心部分，它并不与我的心理整体相等同，而仅仅是其他情结中的一种情结。因此我把自我（ego）与自身（self，参见该条）两者区别开来，因为自我只是我的意识的主体，而自身则是我的全部心理的主体，因而也包括无意识。在这个意义上，自身是一个包含自我在内的理想的统一体。在无意识幻想中，自身常显现为出众的或理想的人格，与歌德的浮士德或尼采的查拉图斯特拉具有某种联系。为了理想化的缘故，自身的古代特征被表现为与“较高层次的”自身的分离，例如表现为歌德的靡菲斯特或斯比特勒的埃庇米修斯。在基督教心理中，则表现为恶魔或反基督的形象（Antichrist）。在尼采那里，查拉图斯特拉则从“最丑陋的人”身上发现了他的阴影。

### 16a.情绪 (emotion)

参见“感情”（affect）条。


## 17. 移情作用 (empathy)

EMPATHY is an *introjection* (q.v.) of the object. For a fuller description of the concept of empathy, see ; also *projection*.

移情作用是客体的内向投射。对移情作用的更充分的描述可见第7章；也见投射条。

## 18. 对立形态 (Enantiodromia)

ENANTIODROMIA means a “running counter to.” In the philosophy of Heraclitus it is used to designate the play of opposites in the course of events—the view that everything that exists turns into its opposite. “From the living comes death and from the dead life, from the young old age and from the old youth; from waking, sleep, and from sleep, waking; the stream of generation and decay never stands still.” “Construction and destruction, destruction and construction—this is the principle which governs all the cycles of natural life, from the smallest to the greatest. Just as the cosmos itself arose from the primal fire, so must it return once more into the same—a dual process running its measured course through vast periods of time, a drama eternally re-enacted.” Such is the enantiodromia of Heraclitus in the words of qualified interpreters. He himself says:

对立形态意味着一种“流转”（running counter to）。在赫拉克利特（Heraclitus）哲学中，它被用来指诸对立物在事件过程中的轮值——认为一切存在皆向其对立面转化。“从生命产生出死亡，亦从死亡产生出生命；从年轻产生出衰老，亦从衰老产生出年轻；从醒觉产生出睡眠，亦从睡眠产生出醒觉；生殖与衰败的川流永不停息。”“建设与破坏、破坏与建设——这是支配从最微小的到最巨大的一切自然生命循环的原则。正像宇宙本身起源于太初之火一样，它必将再度回归到同样的火——一种在漫长的时间中依照有规律的节奏进行的双重过程，一幕永恒重演的戏剧。”这是权威的翻译家们所解释的赫拉克利特的对立形态。赫拉克利特自己说：

> It is the opposite which is good for us.<br/>对我们来说至善便是对立。
>
> Men do not know how what is at variance agrees with itself. It is an attunement of opposite tensions, like that of the bow and the lyre.<br/>人们并不知道有差异之物本身是如何协调的。那是对立紧张的一种协调，正像琴弓与琴弦的协调一样。
>
> The bow (βιός) is called life (βιός), but its work is death.<br/>当它们诞生时，它们准备生，也因此准备承受死。
>
> Mortals are immortals and immortals are mortals, the one living the others’ death and dying the others’ life.<br/>易朽即是永恒，永恒即是易朽，一物的生即是他物的死，一物的死即是他物的生。
>
> For souls it is death to become water, for water death to become earth. But from earth comes water, and from water, soul.<br/>就灵魂而言，它死亡变成了水，就水而言，它死亡变成了泥土。从泥土产生水，从水产生灵魂。
>
> All things are an exchange for fire, and fire for all things, like goods for gold and gold for goods.<br/>万物皆与火交换，火与万物交换，正像货物与金子交换、金子与货物交换一样。
>
> The way up and the way down are the same.<br/>向上的道路和向下的道路是同一条道路。

I use the term enantiodromia for the emergence of the unconscious opposite in the course of time. This characteristic phenomenon practically always occurs when an extreme, onesided tendency dominates conscious life; in time an equally powerful counterposition is built up, which first inhibits the conscious performance and subsequently breaks through the conscious control. Good examples of enantiodromia are: the conversion of St. Paul and of Raymund Lully, the self-identification of the sick Nietzsche with Christ, and his deification and subsequent hatred of Wagner, the transformation of Swedenborg from an erudite scholar into a seer, and so on.

我用对立形态一词来表达时间过程中无意识对立的出现。这种显著的现象实际上总是出现在一种极端的片面的倾向支配着意识生命的时刻；在此时刻，一种相当有力的对立形成了，它开始抑制意识的活动，随后便打破了意识的控制。圣保罗和诺利（Raymond Lully）对基督教的皈依便是对立形态的极佳例证；病态的尼采开始把瓦格纳奉若神明，随后又对他恨之入骨，最后则以基督自居，也是一个很好的例证；斯韦登博格（Swedenborg）从学者到先知的转变也是如此，等等。

## 19. 外倾 (extraversion)

EXTRAVERSION is an outward-turning of *libido* (q.v.). I use this concept to denote a manifest relation of subject to object, a positive movement of subjective interest towards the object. Everyone in the extraverted state thinks, feels, and acts in relation to the object, and moreover in a direct and clearly observable fashion, so that no doubt can remain about his positive dependence on the object. In a sense, therefore, extraversion is a transfer of interest from subject to object. If it is an extraversion of thinking, the subject thinks himself into the object; if an extraversion of feeling, he feels himself into it. In extraversion there is a strong, if not exclusive, determination by the object. Extraversion is *active* when it is intentional, and *passive*when the object compels it, i.e., when the object attracts the subject’s interest of its own accord, even against his will. When extraversion is habitual, we speak of the extraverted *type* (q.v.).

外倾意指欲力的外向转移。我用这个概念来表示主体对客体的一种明显的联系，一种主观兴趣明确朝向客体的运动。处于外倾状况，每个人都在与客体相关的联系中进行思考、感受和行动，并且其方式是直接的、显而易见的，以致毫无疑问地存在着他对于客体的明确的依附性。因而在此意义上，外倾是一种从主体到客体的兴趣的转移。如果是一种思维的外倾，那么主体自己便入乎客体之内来运思；如果是一种情感的外倾，那么就觉得自己进入了客体。处于外倾状态时，就算客体不是唯一的决定因素，也至少具有强大的力量。当外倾是意向性的时，它是主动的，当客体驱使它时，即当客体根据自己的要求吸引主体的兴趣，甚至吸引与其意志相反的兴趣时，它就成为被动的了。外倾一旦形成习惯，我们就称其为外倾类型。

## 20. 幻想 (fantasy)

By fantasy I understand two different things: 1. a *fantasm*, and 2. *imaginative activity*. In the present work the context always shows which of these meanings is intended. By fantasy in the sense of *fantasm* I mean a complex of ideas that is distinguished from other such complexes by the fact that it has no objective referent. Although it may originally be based on memory-images of actual experiences, its content refers to no external reality; it is merely the output of creative psychic activity, a manifestation or product of a combination of energized psychic elements. In so far as psychic energy can be voluntarily directed, a fantasy can be consciously and intentionally produced, either as a whole or at least in part. In the former case it is nothing but a combination of *conscious* elements, an artificial experiment of purely theoretical interest. In actual everyday psychological experience, fantasy is either set in motion by an intuitive attitude of expectation, or it is an irruption of *unconscious*contents into consciousness.

我把幻想理解为两种不同的情况：（1）想像的虚构物（phantasm）；（2）想像的活动（imaginative activity）。在本书的行文中总是显示出这两种规定的含义。当它被用来表示想像的虚构物时，是指一种没有客观的参照物，而与其他的情结相区别的观念的情结。虽然想像的虚构物可能最初建立在实际经验的记忆-意象（memory-images）的基础上，但是它的内容却未参照外在现实；它纯粹是创造性心理活动的产物，纯粹是一种具有能量的心理因素组合下的产品或表现形式。由于心理能量能自发地定向，幻想也可能整个地或至少部分地被有意识地和蓄意地产生出来。在前种状况里，它只不过是一种意识因素的组合，一种纯粹理论兴趣的人为的经验。在实际日常心理经验中，幻想不是产生于期待的直觉的态度，就是表现为无意识内容侵入了意识中。

We can distinguish between *active* and *passive*fantasy. *Active* fantasies are the product of *intuition* (q.v.), i.e., they are evoked by an *attitude* (q.v.) directed to the perception of unconscious contents, as a result of which the *libido* (q.v.) immediately invests all the elements emerging from the unconscious and, by association with parallel material, brings them into clear focus in visual form. *Passive*fantasies appear in visual form at the outset, neither preceded nor accompanied by intuitive expectation, the attitude of the subject being wholly passive. Such fantasies belong to the category of psychic *automatisms* (Janet). Naturally, they can appear only as a result of a relative dissociation of the psyche, since they presuppose a withdrawal of energy from conscious control and a corresponding activation of unconscious material. Thus the vision of St. Paul presupposes that unconsciously he was already a Christian, though this fact had escaped his conscious insight.

我们能够区分积极幻想与消极幻想，它们都是直觉的产物，即为一种导向对无意识内容的知觉的态度所唤起，其结果是使欲力即刻渗入所有从无意识中浮现的要素中，通过借助于相关材料的联想，将这些无意识的要素带进清晰可见的形式中。消极幻想既没有直觉的期望先行预示也没有直觉的期望相伴随行，从一开始它就以可见的形式出现，其主体的态度完全是被动的。这种幻想属于心理的自主性的幻觉以他在无意识中的准备接受基督教为先决条件，尽管他的意识并没有洞察到这一事实。

It is probable that passive fantasies always have their origin in an unconscious process that is antithetical to consciousness, but invested with approximately the same amount of energy as the conscious attitude, and therefore capable of breaking through the latter’s resistance. Active fantasies, on the other hand, owe their existence not so much to this unconscious process as to a conscious propensity to assimilate hints or fragments of lightly-toned unconscious complexes and, by associating them with parallel elements, to elaborate them in clearly visual form. It is not necessarily a question of a dissociated psychic state, but rather of a positive participation of consciousness.

或许，消极幻想总是产生于与意识相对立的无意识过程，但在此过程中却投入了大致相当于投入意识态度中一样数量的能量，因此它具有冲破意识阻抗的能力。相反，积极幻想的存在，与其说应归因于无意识过程，倒不如说应归因于一种意识的倾向，该倾向吸收了某些具有轻微色调的无意识情结的暗示或片断，由联想将它们与相关的因素联结起来，精心地编构于明晰可见的形式中。因此，这里并不必然存在分裂的心理状态的问题，而更多的是意识的积极参与的问题。

Whereas passive fantasy not infrequently bears a morbid stamp or at least shows some trace of abnormality, active fantasy is one of the highest forms of psychic activity. For here the conscious and the unconscious personality of the subject flow together into a common product in which both are united. Such a fantasy can be the highest expression of the unity of a man’s *individuality* (q.v.), and it may even create that individuality by giving perfect expression to its unity. As a general rule, passive fantasy is never the expression of a unified individuality since, as already observed, it presupposes a considerable degree of dissociation based in turn on a marked conscious/unconscious opposition. Hence the fantasy that irrupts into consciousness from such a state can never be the perfect expression of a unified individuality, but will represent mainly the standpoint of the unconscious personality. The life of St. Paul affords a good example of this: his conversion to Christianity signified an acceptance of the hitherto unconscious standpoint and a repression of the hitherto anti-Christian one, which then made itself felt in his hysterical attacks. Passive fantasy, therefore, is always in need of conscious *criticism*, lest it merely reinforce the standpoint of the unconscious opposite. Whereas active fantasy, as the product of a conscious attitude *not* opposed to the unconscious, and of unconscious processes not opposed but merely compensatory to consciousness, does not require criticism so much as *understanding*.

消极幻想常常带有病态的特征或至少带有某些非正常的迹象，而积极幻想却属于最高级的心理活动形式之一。因为在这里，在这条汇集的溪流中，主体的意识人格和无意识人格都汇聚成了一个共同的相互统一的产品。这样的幻想可以说是对人的个性化的统一体的最高表现形式；甚至可以说通过它对人的统一体的完美表达而创造出了个性。一般来说，消极幻想从不能成为对一个统一的个性的表现形式，因为像已经考察过的，它以依次建立在显著的意识/无意识基点上的相当程度的分裂为先决条件。因此，从这样一种状况强行闯入意识的幻想不可能成为对一个统一的个性的完美表现，而只能主要地体现无意识人格的观点。圣保罗的生命提供了这方面的最佳例证：他对基督教的皈依意味着他对先前的无意识观点的接受以及对先前的反基督教观点的压抑，后来在他的歇斯底里的发作中才意识到这一点。因此，消极幻想总是需要意识的批判，以免它纯粹强化了无意识对立的观点。然而，积极幻想作为并不与无意识相对立的意识态度的产品，而且作为并不与意识相对立反而作为其补偿的无意识的产品，它并不需要这种批判，所需要的只是理解。

In fantasies as in dreams (which are nothing but passive fantasies), a *manifest* and a *latent* meaning must be distinguished. The manifest meaning is found in the actual “look” of the fantasy image, in the direct statement made by the underlying complex of ideas. Frequently, however, the manifest meaning hardly deserves its name, although it is always far more developed in fantasies than in dreams, probably because the dream-fantasy usually requires very little energy to overcome the feeble resistance of the sleeping consciousness, with the result that tendencies which are only slightly antagonistic and slightly compensatory can also reach the threshold of perception. Waking fantasy, on the other hand, must muster considerable energy to overcome the inhibition imposed by the conscious attitude. For this to take place, the unconscious opposite must be a very important one in order to break through into consciousness. If it consisted merely of vague, elusive hints it would never be able to direct attention (conscious libido) to itself so effectively as to interrupt the continuity of the conscious contents. The unconscious opposite, therefore, has to depend on a very strong inner cohesion, and this expresses itself in an emphatic manifest meaning.

如同在梦（梦只是消极幻想）中一样，在幻想中，外显的意义与潜在的意义必须区分开来。外显的意义见于幻想意象的具体“样式”中，见于从观念情结的底层所直接呈现的东西中。然而，外显的意义常常名不副实，虽然它在幻想中的发展程度总是远甚于梦；或许这是因为梦的幻想通常无需太多的能量就能克服昏昏欲睡的意识的微弱阻力，使得仅有轻微对抗性的和仅有轻微补偿性的倾向就能达到知觉的阈限。与此相反，清醒的幻想必须拥有相当大的能量才能克服意识态度所设置的抑制。为了使清醒的幻想得以发生，无意识的对立必定是非常重要的，以便有能力取得突破而进入意识中。如果它仅仅由模糊而几乎不能把握的暗示组成，它就绝不能把意识的注意力（意识的欲力）引向自身，从而有效地中断意识内容的连续性。因此，无意识的对立不得不依赖于一种非常强大的内在凝聚力，以一种着重强调的外显的意义来表现自己。

The manifest meaning always has the character of a visual and concrete process which, because of its objective unreality, can never satisfy the conscious demand for understanding. Hence another meaning of the fantasy, in other words its interpretation or latent meaning, has to be sought. Although the existence of a latent meaning is by no means certain, and although the very possibility of it may be contested, the demand for understanding is a sufficient motive for a thorough-going investigation. This investigation of the latent meaning may be purely causal, inquiring into the psychological origins of the fantasy. It leads on the one hand to the remoter causes of the fantasy in the distant past, and on the other to ferreting out the instinctual forces which, from the energic standpoint, must be responsible for the fantasy activity. As we know, Freud has made intensive use of this method. It is a method of interpretation which I call *reductive* (q.v.). The justification of a reductive view is immediately apparent, and it is equally obvious that this method of interpreting psychological facts suffices for people of a certain temperament, so that no demand for a deeper understanding is made. If somebody shouts for help, this is sufficiently and satisfactorily explained when it is shown that the man is in immediate danger of his life. If a man dreams of a sumptuous feast, and it is shown that he went to bed hungry, this is a sufficient explanation of his dream. Or if a man who represses his sexuality has sexual fantasies like a medieval hermit, this is satisfactorily explained by a reduction to sexual repression.

外显的意义总是具有可见的和具体过程的特征，因为它客观上的非现实性，它不可能满足意识进行理解的要求。因而不得不寻找另一种意义来满足意识的要求，换句话说即寻找其解释或潜在的意义。虽然潜在意义的存在绝不是确定的，虽然它极可能存在争议，但是理解的要求足以成为彻底探求的动机。这种对潜在意义的探求或许是纯粹因果性的，它要求探究幻想的心理根源。一方面，它追本溯源地导向幻想在久远的过去的成因，另一方面则要搜寻出本能的力量，从能量的观点来看，这种本能力量与幻想的活动密切相关。众所周知，弗洛伊德惯于使用这种方法。我把这种解释的方法称之为还原的。还原的观点的合理性是显而易见的，但同样显而易见的是，这种用于解释心理事实的方法，对具有某种气质的人来说已经十分足够了，无需要求更深层的理解。如果某人发出寻求援助的叫喊，而后来证实此人确实处于生命垂危之中，那么这一事实就得到了恰当而令人满意的解释。如果一个人梦见一桌丰盛的佳肴，而事后又证实他是饿着肚子上床睡觉的，那么也为这个梦提供了令人满意的解释。或者假定一个像中世纪的圣徒那样压抑了自己性欲的人产生了性的幻想，那么也可用对性的压抑的还原来做出令人满意的解释。

But if we were to explain Peter’s vision by reducing it to the fact that, being “very hungry,” he had received an invitation from the unconscious to eat animals that were “unclean,” or that the eating of unclean beasts merely signified the fulfilment of a forbidden wish, such an explanation would send us away empty. It would be equally unsatisfactory to reduce Paul’s vision to his repressed envy of the role Christ played among his fellow countrymen, which prompted him to identify himself with Christ. Both explanations may contain some glimmering of truth, but they are in no way related to the real psychology of the two apostles, conditioned as this was by the times they lived in. The explanation is too facile. One cannot discuss historical events as though they were problems of physiology or a purely personal *chronique scandaleuse*. That would be altogether too limited a point of view. We are therefore compelled to broaden very considerably our conception of the latent meaning of fantasy, first of all in its causal aspect. The psychology of an individual can never be exhaustively explained from himself alone: a clear recognition is needed of the way it is also conditioned by historical and environmental circumstances. His individual psychology is not merely a physiological, biological, or moral problem, it is also a contemporary problem. Again, no psychological fact can ever be exhaustively explained in terms of causality alone; as a living phenomenon, it is always indissolubly bound up with the continuity of the vital process, so that it is not only something evolved but also continually evolving and creative.

但是，倘若我们要用还原到事实的方法来解释圣彼得的幻觉，认为他由于“饥肠辘辘”而受到来自无意识的诱惑，要他去吃那“不洁”的动物，或者认为吃这些不洁的动物纯粹意味着一种受到禁制的愿望的实现，那么这样的解释将使我们一无所获。假如我们把圣保罗的幻觉还原到他对基督在他的同胞中扮演的角色所产生的那种受到压抑的忌妒，而正是这种忌妒促使他后来与基督相认同，那么这种解释也同样不能令人满意。这两种解释都可能具有某种真理的闪光，但是它们绝没有触及到这两位使徒（指圣保罗和圣彼得）的真实心理，因为解释受到他们所生活的时代的限制。这种解释太过于简单了。我们不能把历史事件当作似乎是生理的或纯粹个人丑闻录那样的问题来讨论。这种观点显然具有太大的局限性。因此我们不得不极大地拓展我们关于幻想的潜在意义的概念，首先是它的因果关系方面。个体心理从不能孤立地从个体本身做出穷尽的解释：清醒的认识需要这样的方法，个体心理也同时受到历史和环境的约束。它并非粹纯是一个生理的、生物的或道德的问题，而且也是一个时代的问题。况且，没有任何心理事实能孤立地依据因果关系获得彻底的解释；作为一种生命现象，它总是与生机过程的连续体有着不可分解的联系，因而它不仅只是业已演进而成的东西，而且也是仍在演进和创造的东西。

Anything psychic is Janus-faced—it looks both backwards and forwards. Because it is evolving, it is also preparing the future. Were this not so, intentions, aims, plans, calculations, predictions and premonitions would be psychological impossibilities. If, when a man expresses an opinion, we simply relate it to an opinion previously expressed by someone else, this explanation is quite futile, for we wish to know not merely what prompted him to do so, but what he means by it, what his aims and intentions are, and what he hopes to achieve. And when we know that, we are usually satisfied. In everyday life we instinctively, without thinking, introduce a final standpoint into an explanation; indeed, very often we take the final standpoint as the decisive one and completely disregard the strictly causal factor, instinctively recognizing the creative element in everything psychic. If we do this in everyday life, then a scientific psychology must take this fact into account, and not rely exclusively on the strictly causal standpoint originally taken over from natural science, for it has also to consider the purposive nature of the psyche.

任何心理都具有两面性——既回顾也前瞻。因为它在演进着，也预示着未来。倘若不是这样，那么意向、目标、计划、预测和预感就不再具有心理的可能性。当一个人表达一种观点时，如果我们仅仅把这种观点与先前别人表达过的观点联系起来，那么这种解释就是相当不充分的，因为我们不仅希望知道他的行为的原因，而且希望知道他的行为的意义，他的目的和意图，他希望实现的东西。通常，我们一旦知道了这些，我们就心满意足了。在日常生活中，我们不假思索便本能地把目的性的观点带入了解释中；事实上，我们常常把目的性的观点当作决定性的东西，而完全不管严格的因果性因素，近乎本能地去辨识所有心理中的创造性因素。如果我们在日常生活中是这么做的，那么一门科学的心理学就必须考虑到这种状况，而不是唯一地依赖于最初从自然科学中所获取的严格的因果性观点；因为它也必须考虑到心理的目的性。

If, then, everyday experience establishes beyond doubt the final orientation of conscious contents, we have absolutely no grounds for assuming, in the absence of experience to the contrary, that this is not the case with the contents of the unconscious. My experience gives me no reason at all to dispute this; on the contrary, cases where the introduction of the final standpoint alone provides a satisfactory explanation are in the majority. If we now look at Paul’s vision again, but this time from the angle of his future mission, and come to the conclusion that Paul, though consciously a persecutor of Christians, had unconsciously adopted the Christian standpoint, and that he was finally brought to avow it by an irruption of the unconscious, because his unconscious personality was constantly striving toward this goal—this seems to me a more adequate explanation of the real significance of the event than a reduction to personal motives, even though these doubtless played their part in some form or other, since the “all-too-human” is never lacking. Similarly, the clear indication given in Acts 10:28 of a purposive interpretation of Peter’s vision is far more satisfying than a merely physiological and personal conjecture.

那么，如果说日常经验无可置疑地确立了意识内容的目的性取向，在没有相反的经验的情况下，我们完全没有理由假定，无意识内容不是这样的情形。我的经验使我没有任何理由怀疑内容的目的性取向；相反，绝大多数情况都是，只有通过引进目的性的观点才能获得令人满意的解释。现在，如果我们再来思考保罗的幻觉，但这次是从他未来的使命这一角度来思考，那么我们可以获得这样的结论，虽然保罗在意识上是一位基督徒的迫害者，但他却无意识地接受了基督教的观点，由于无意识观点的侵入，他不得不最终公开地承认了它，因为他的无意识人格始终朝这一目标而奋斗——在我看来，这似乎比还原到个人动机的解释更契合事件的真正含义，尽管这些动机无疑地也以这种或那种形式发挥了某种作用，因为“太过于人性的”（all-too-human）情况是从不缺乏的。同样地，这也清楚地暗示了对《使徒行传》（第10章第28节）中圣彼得的幻觉所作的目的性解释，它远比单纯生理的和个人性的推测要令人满意得多。

To sum up, we might say that a fantasy needs to be understood both causally and purposively. Causally interpreted, it seems like a *symptom* of a physiological or personal state, the outcome of antecedent events. Purposively interpreted, it seems like a *symbol*, seeking to characterize a definite goal with the help of the material at hand, or trace out a line of future psychological development. Because active fantasy is the chief mark of the artistic mentality, the artist is not just a *reproducer* of appearances but a creator and educator, for his works have the value of symbols that adumbrate lines of future development. Whether the symbols will have a limited or a general social validity depends on the viability of the creative individual. The more abnormal, i.e., the less viable he is, the more limited will be the social validity of the symbols he produces, though their value may be absolute for the individual himself.

总之，我们可以说，幻想既需要因果性又需要目的性的解释。通过因果关系的解释，它显现为一种生理的或个人状态的征兆（symptom），是先前事件的结果。而通过目的性的解释，幻想显现为一种象征，借助现存在手的材料的帮助它努力刻画出某种明确的目的，或追寻未来心理发展的线索。由于积极幻想是艺术心灵的主要标志，艺术家就并非只是一个外观的再现者，而是一位创造者和教育者，因为他的作品具有预示未来发展线索的象征的价值。其象征的社会有效性是普遍的还是有限的，这取决于他创造性个体的生命能力（viability）。个体越是反常，即他的生存能力越小，他所创造的象征的普遍社会价值就越是有限，尽管对个体本身来说它们的价值可能是绝对的。

One can dispute the existence of the latent meaning of fantasy only if one is of the opinion that natural processes in general are devoid of meaning. Science, however, has extracted the meaning of natural processes in the form of natural laws. These, admittedly, are human hypotheses advanced in explanation of such processes. But, in so far as we have ascertained that the proposed law actually coincides with the objective process, we are also justified in speaking of the meaning of natural occurrences. We are equally justified in speaking of the meaning of fantasies when it can be shown that they conform to law. But the meaning we discover is satisfying, or to put it another way, the demonstrated law deserves its name, only when it adequately reflects the nature of fantasy. Natural processes both conform to law and demonstrate that law. It is a law that one dreams when one sleeps, but that is not a law which demonstrates anything about the nature of the dream; it is a mere condition of the dream. The demonstration of a physiological source of fantasy is likewise a mere condition of its existence, not a law of its nature. The law of fantasy as a psychological phenomenon can only be a psychological law.

一个人没有权利争辩幻想的潜在意义的存在，除非他认为一般的自然过程缺乏任何意义。然而，自然科学已经把自然过程的意义抽取为自然律的形式。坦率地说，这些都是人为的假设，以利于对自然过程作出解释。但是，只是就我们确信这些预设的规律确实与客观过程相符合而言，才使我们有资格讨论自然事件的意义。同样地，正是由于我们证实幻想是遵循规律的，所以我们才有资格谈论幻想的意义。但是，只有当被揭示的意义确切地表现了幻想的本质时这才会令人满意，或者换句话说，就是证明其规律是名副其实的。自然过程既遵循规律又证实规律。一个人睡眠时会做梦这是合乎规律的，但却并非是能够证明任何有关梦的性质的规律；它仅仅是做梦的条件。对于幻想的生理原因的论证也同样只是幻想存在的条件，而并不是关于其本质的规律。作为一种心理现象的幻想的规律只能是一种心理的规律。

This brings us to the second connotation of fantasy, namely *imaginative activity*. Imagination is the reproductive or creative activity of the mind in general. It is not a special faculty, since it can come into play in all the basic forms of psychic activity, whether *thinking, feeling, sensation*, or *intuition* (qq.v.). Fantasy as imaginative activity is, in my view, simply the direct expression of psychic life, of psychic energy which cannot appear in consciousness except in the form of images or contents, just as physical energy cannot manifest itself except as a definite physical state stimulating the sense organs in physical ways. For as every physical state, from the energic standpoint, is a dynamic system, so from the same standpoint a psychic content is a dynamic system manifesting itself in consciousness. We could therefore say that fantasy in the sense of a fantasm is a definite sum of libido that cannot appear in consciousness in any other way than in the form of an image. A fantasm is an *idée-force*. Fantasy as imaginative activity is identical with the flow of psychic energy.

这就把我们领向了幻想的第二层意义，即想像的活动。想像是心灵一般性的再造的或创造的活动。它不是一种特殊的功能，因为无论在思维、情感、感觉还是直觉这些心理活动的基本形式中，它都可以发挥作用。在我看来，作为想像活动的幻想只不过是对心理生命的直接表达，对那些除了以意象或内容的形式便无法出现在意识中的心理能量的直接表现，正如物理能量除非作为一种以物理方式来刺激感觉器官的特定物理状态外，是无由显示自身的。因为从能量的观点来看，正像所有的物理状态都是一种动力系统一样，心理内容也是出现在意识中的动力系统。因此我们可以说，想像虚构物意义上的幻想只不过是一定量的欲力，它不能以任何其他的形式而只能以意象的形式出现在意识中。想像虚构物是一种观念力（idée-force）。作为想像活动的幻想与心理的能量流是对等的。

## 21. 情感 (feeling)

I count feeling among the four basic psychological *functions* (q.v.). I am unable to support the psychological school that considers feeling a secondary phenomenon dependent on “representations” or sensations, but in company with Höffding, Wundt, Lehmann, Külpe, Baldwin, and others, I regard it as an independent function *sui generis*.”

我把情感归于四大基本心理功能之一。我不赞同那样的心理学派，他们把情感视为一种依赖于“表现”或感觉的衍生现象，而与霍夫丁（Höffding）、冯特、莱曼（Lehmann）、库尔佩（Külpe）、鲍德文（Baldwin）及其他心理学家相一致，我把情感视为一种自成一类的独立的心理功能。

Feeling is primarily a process that takes place between the *ego* (q.v.) and a given content, a process, moreover, that imparts to the content a definite *value* in the sense of acceptance or rejection (“like” or “dislike”). The process can also appear isolated, as it were, in the form of a “mood,” regardless of the momentary contents of consciousness or momentary sensations. The mood may be causally related to earlier conscious contents, though not necessarily so, since, as psychopathology amply proves, it may equally well arise from unconscious contents. But even a mood, whether it be a general or only a partial feeling, implies a valuation; not of one definite, individual conscious content, but of the whole conscious situation at the moment, and, once again, with special reference to the question of acceptance or rejection.

情感主要是发生在自我与某一特定内容之间的一种过程，是在接纳或拒斥（如“喜欢”或“反感”）意义上给内容以某种特定的价值的过程。该过程也可能会以“情绪”（mood）的形式孤立地出现，为片刻的意识内容或片刻感觉所忽视。情绪或许与先前的意识内容有着因果上的联系，尽管并非必然如此，因为，正如心理病理学所大量证明的那样，它同样产生于无意识的内容。但是，即便是一种情绪，无论它是一般的情感还是仅为部分的情感，都意味着一种评价；但并不是对某种特定的、个别的意识内容的评价，而是对当下整个意识情境的评价，同时，它尤其涉及到接纳或拒斥的问题。

Feeling, therefore, is an entirely *subjective* process, which may be in every respect independent of external stimuli, though it allies itself with every sensation. Even an “indifferent” sensation possesses a feeling-tone, namely that of indifference, which again expresses some sort of valuation. Hence feeling is a kind of *judgment*, differing from intellectual judgment in that its aim is not to establish conceptual relations but to set up a subjective criterion of acceptance or rejection. Valuation by feeling extends to *every* content of consciousness, of whatever kind it may be. When the intensity of feeling increases, it turns into an *affect*(q.v.), i.e., a feeling-state accompanied by marked physical innervations. Feeling is distinguished from affect by the fact that it produces no perceptible physical innervations, i.e., neither more nor less than an ordinary thinking process.

因此，情感完全是一种主观过程，它可能各个方面都独立于外在刺激，尽管它与每一种感觉紧密关联。即使是一种“无动于衷的”感觉也具有一种情感的色调，即是说冷漠也表现了某种评价。因而情感是一种判断，不过，不同于理性判断的是，它的目的并非建立在概念的关系上，而是设立了一种接受或拒绝的主观取向。情感评价延伸至所有的意识内容，无论什么种类都有。当情感的强度增大时，就转变成了感情，即一种伴随明显的身体神经刺激的情感-状态。情感与感情的区别在于，它并未产生可知觉到的身体上的神经刺激，或者说它所产生的神经刺激大致相当于一般的思维过程。

Ordinary, “simple” feeling is *concrete* (q.v.), that is, it is mixed up with other functional elements, more particularly with sensations. In this case we can call it *affective* or, as I have done in this book, *feeling-sensation*, by which I mean an almost inseparable amalgam of feeling and sensation elements. This characteristic amalgamation is found wherever feeling is still an undifferentiated function, and is most evident in the psyche of a neurotic with differentiated thinking. Although feeling is, in itself, an independent function, it can easily become dependent on another function—thinking, for instance; it is then a mere concomitant of thinking, and is not repressed only in so far as it accommodates itself to the thinking processes.

通常，“简单的”情感是具体的（concrete），即是说，它与其他的功能要素相混合，尤其与感觉相混合。在这种状况下，我们称它为感情的（affective），正如我在本书中所作的那样，称其为情感-感觉（feeling-sensation），我由此意指一种几乎难以分离的情感因素与感觉因素的混合物。这种典型的混合出现在情感仍然作为一种未分化的功能的任何地方，而且最明显地出现在具有已分化的思维的心理症患者的心理中。虽然情感本身是一种独立的功能，但是它很容易陷入依赖于其他功能的状况——例如依赖于思维；于是，情感便纯粹成为思维的伴随物，唯有顺应思维的过程，才不会受到压抑。

It is important to distinguish *abstract* feeling from ordinary concrete feeling. Just as the abstract concept (v. *Thinking*) abolishes the differences between things it apprehends, abstract feeling rises above the differences of the individual contents it evaluates, and produces a “mood” or feeling-state which embraces the different individual valuations and thereby abolishes them. In the same way that thinking organizes the contents of consciousness under concepts, feeling arranges them according to their value. The more concrete it is, the more subjective and personal is the value conferred upon them; but the more abstract it is, the more universal and objective the value will be. Just as a completely abstract concept no longer coincides with the singularity and discreteness of things, but only with their universality and non-differentiation, so completely abstract feeling no longer coincides with a particular content and its feeling-value, but with the undifferentiated totality of all contents. Feeling, like thinking, is a *rational* (q.v.) function, since values in general are assigned according to the laws of reason, just as concepts in general are formed according to these laws.

把抽象的情感与普通的具体情感区分开来是极为重要的。正像抽象的概念（参见“思维”条）取消了它所领会的事物之间的差异一样，抽象的情感也超越了它所要评价的个别内容的差异，产生出一种既含括不同的个别的评价又由此而取消了这些评价的“情调”或情感状态。以同样的方式，思维将意识内容组织在概念名下，情感则根据意识内容的价值来安置它们。情感越是具体，它赋予意识内容的价值就越是主观化和个人化；而情感越是抽象，它所赋予的价值就愈是普遍化与客观化。正像一个完全抽象的概念不再与事物的个性和特性相一致，而仅仅显露事物的普遍性和无差异性一样，完全抽象的情感也不再与特殊的内容及其情感价值相一致，而仅仅与所有内容的未分化的整体性相一致。情感正同于思维，它是一种理性的功能，因为一般的价值是根据理性的规律来配置的，正如一般的概念根据理性的规律而形成一样。

Naturally the above definitions do not give the essence of feeling—they only describe it from outside. The intellect proves incapable of formulating the real nature of feeling in conceptual terms, since thinking belongs to a category incommensurable with feeling; in fact, no basic psychological function can ever be completely expressed by another. That being so, it is impossible for an intellectual definition to reproduce the specific character of feeling at all adequately. The mere classification of feelings adds nothing to an understanding of their nature, because even the most exact classification will be able to indicate only the content of feeling which the intellect can apprehend, without grasping its specific nature. Only as many classes of feelings can be discriminated as there are classes of contents that can be intellectually apprehended, but feeling *per se* can never be exhaustively classified because, beyond every possible class of contents accessible to the intellect, there still exist feelings which resist intellectual classification. The very notion of classification is intellectual and therefore incompatible with the nature of feeling. We must therefore be content to indicate the limits of the concept.

自然，上述定义并没有给出情感的本质——它们仅仅从外部描述了它。理性证明它无法以概念的术语来系统地阐释情感的真正本质，因为思维属于与情感无法相容的范畴；事实上，没有任何基本心理功能能完全由另一种功能来表述。由于这种状况，任何理性的定义都不可能完全恰当地复制情感的特殊本质。仅仅对情感做出分类丝毫无助于理解它们的本质，因为即便是最精确的分类也只能预示着表达了那种理性所能理解到的情感的内容，根本无法把握情感的特殊本质。对情感所作的众多的分类仅仅能够辨析出存在多少种能被理性所理解的内容，但情感本身（per se）从不能为分类所穷尽，因为这超出了理性可能达及到的所有内容分类的范围，仍然存在着拒绝理性进行分类的情感。分类的观念实质上是理性的，因而根本就与情感的本质无法相容。因此我们必须满足于对此概念所作的限定。

The nature of valuation by feeling may be compared with intellectual *apperception* (q.v.) as an *apperception of value*. We can distinguish *active* and *passive* apperception by feeling. Passive feeling allows itself to be attracted or excited by a particular content, which then forces the feelings of the subject to participate. Active feeling is a transfer of value from the subject; it is an intentional valuation of the content in accordance with feeling and not in accordance with the intellect. Hence active feeling is a *directed* function, an act of the *will* (q.v.), as for instance loving as opposed to being in love. The latter would be *undirected*, passive feeling, as these expressions themselves show: the one is an activity, the other a passive state. Undirected feeling is *feeling-intuition*. Strictly speaking, therefore, only active, directed feeling should be termed *rational*, whereas passive feeling is *irrational* (q.v.) in so far as it confers values without the participation or even against the intentions of the subject. When the subject’s attitude as a whole is oriented by the feeling function, we speak of a *feeling type* (v. *Type*).

情感评价的本质可与理性的统觉相比较，当作一种对价值的统觉。我们能由情感把主动的统觉与被动的统觉区分开来。被动的情感听任自己为一种特定的内容所吸引或激发，然后迫使主体的情感参与到这种内容中来。主动的情感则是从主体方面所作的一种价值的传达；它对与情感相一致而不与理性相一致的内容做出意向性的评价。因此主动的情感是一种定向的功能，一种意志的行为，正如恋爱中的爱与被爱相对立一样。被爱是未定向的、被动的情感，爱是一种主动活动，被爱则是一种被动的状况。未定向的情感处于情感-直觉状态。因此，严格说来，只有主动的、定向的情感能称之为理性的，而被动的情感则是非理性的，因为它所提供的价值并无主体的参与，有时甚至与主体的意向相冲突。当主体的态度完全为情感功能所定向时，我们就称他为情感型（参见“类型”条）。

### 21a.同情 (feeling)

FEELING, A (or FEELINGS). A feeling is the specific content or material of the feeling function, discriminated by *empathy* (q.v.).

同情是情感功能特有的内容或质料，从移情作用可以得到辨析。

## 22. 功能 (function)

也可参见“劣势功能”inferior function条

By a psychological function I mean a particular form of psychic activity that remains the same in principle under varying conditions. From the energic standpoint a function is a manifestation of *libido* (q.v.), which likewise remains constant in principle, in much the same way as a physical force can be considered a specific form or manifestation of physical energy. I distinguish four basic functions in all, two rational and two irrational (qq.v.): *thinking* and *feeling, sensation* and *intuition* (qq.v.). I can give no *a priori* reason for selecting these four as basic functions, and can only point out that this conception has shaped itself out of many years’ experience. I distinguish these functions from one another because they cannot be related or reduced to one another. The principle of thinking, for instance, is absolutely different from the principle of feeling, and so forth. I make a cardinal distinction between these functions and *fantasies* (q.v.), because fantasy is a characteristic form of activity that can manifest itself in all four functions. Volition or *will* (q.v.) seems to me an entirely secondary phenomenon, and so does *attention*.

我把心理功能当作一种原则上在各种情形下都能保持同一不变的特殊的心理活动形式。从能量的观点来看，功能是欲力（参阅该条）的表现形式，欲力在原则上同样是恒定不变的，在相当大的程度上它与物理力一样可以被看作物理能量的特殊形式或显现。我把全部四种基本功能分为两种理性的，两种非理性的：思维与情感，感觉与直觉。至于为什么选择这四种作为基本功能，我不能给出先天的理由，我只能指出，这种想法是据多年的经验形成的。我之所以把这四种功能区分开来是因为它们彼此之间既不相关联又不可相互化约。例如，思维的原则绝不同于情感的原则，其他也一样。我将这些功能与幻想（参阅该条）做了基本的区分，因为幻想是能够在所有四种功能中显示出它自身的一种特殊的活动形式。在我看来，决断或意志（参阅该条）完全是次要的心理现象，其受人注意仅仅如此。

## 23. 观念 (idea)

In this work the concept “idea” is sometimes used to designate a certain psychological element which is closely connected with what I term *image* (q.v.). The image may be either *personal* or *impersonal* in origin. In the latter case it is *collective* (q.v.) and is also distinguished by mythological qualities. I then term it a *primordial image*. When, on the other hand, it has no mythological character, i.e., is lacking in visual qualities and merely collective, I speak of an *idea*. Accordingly, I use the term idea to express the *meaning* of a primordial image, a meaning that has been abstracted from the *concretism* (q.v.) of the image. In so far as an idea is an *abstraction* (q.v.), it has the appearance of something derived, or developed, from elementary factors, a product of thought. This is the sense in which it is conceived by Wundt and many others.

在本书中，观念这一概念有时是指与我所谈及的意象（参阅该条）有密切联系的某种心理因素。就其起源而言，意象或许是个人的或非个人的。在后种情况下，它是集体的（参阅该条），以其神话的特性而区别于前者。这样，我称之为原初意象。相反，当它不具有神话的特征，即缺乏灵视的性质且纯粹是集体的时，我称之为观念。据此，我把观念一词用来表达某种原初意象的意义，该意义是从意象的具体性（参阅该条）中抽象出来的。就观念作为一种抽象（参阅该条）而言，它具有某种从基本要素中衍生或发展而来的外观，即思维的一种产品。这就是冯特及其他人所认为的意义。

In so far, however, as an idea is the formulated meaning of a primordial image by which it was represented *symbolically* (v. *Symbol*), its essence is not just something derived or developed, but, psychologically speaking, exists *a priori*, as a given possibility for thought-combinations in general. Hence, in accordance with its essence (but not with its formulation), the idea is a psychological determinant having an *a priori* existence. In this sense Plato sees the idea as a prototype of things, while Kant defines it as the “archetype (*Urbild*) of all practical employment of reason,” a transcendental concept which as such exceeds the bounds of the experienceable, “a rational concept whose object is not to be found in experience.” He says:

然而，观念既然是原初意象的被程式化了的意义，原初意象由此得到了象征性地表现，那么，观念的本质就并非是派生的或发展而来的东西，而是从心理学上来说先天存在的东西，作为适应于一般思维结构的一种既定的可能性。因此，根据它的这一本质（而并非根据其程式），观念是一种先天存在的起决定作用的心理因素。正是在这个意义上，柏拉图把观念视为事物的原型，而康德则把它界定为“理性之全部实际运用的原型”，一种超越了可经验事物的局限的超验概念，“一种其对象无法在经验中找到的观念”。康德说：

> Although we must say of the transcendental concepts of reason that *they are only ideas*, this is not by any means to be taken as signifying that they are superfluous and void. For even if they cannot determine any object, they may yet, in a fundamental and unobserved fashion, be of service to the understanding as a canon for its extended and consistent employment. The understanding does not thereby obtain more knowledge of any object than it would have by means of its own concepts, but for the acquiring of such knowledge it receives better and more extensive guidance. Further—what we need here no more than mention—concepts of reason may perhaps make a possible transition from the concepts of nature to the practical concepts, and in that way may give support to the moral ideas themselves.
>
> 虽然我们必定说理性的超验概念它们仅仅是观念罢了，但这绝不意味着它们是多余的和空洞的。因为即便它们不能决定任何对象，但它们或许仍然以一种基本的且未被注意的样式有助于知性，作为知性用以延伸的和一致使用上的标准。由此，知性并不能更多地获得超出它自身概念的关于对象的认识，但是从这样一种认识来看，它却获取了更好和更广阔的指引。进一步而言——我们在此所需要的东西并不值得提及——理性的概念或许产生了一种从自然的概念向实际的具体的概念的过渡，在此过渡中，理性概念能给道德观念本身以支撑。

叔本华说：

> By Idea, then, I understand every definite and well-established stage in the objectivation of the Will, so far as the Will is a thing-in-itself and therefore without multiplicity, which stages are related to individual things as their eternal forms or prototypes.
>
> 就意志是一种自在之物，并因此而脱离了杂多性而言，我把观念理解为意志客观化过程的每一个特定而确立的阶段；这些阶段作为其永恒的形式或原型而与个别事物相关联。

For Schopenhauer the idea is a visual thing, for he conceives it entirely in the way I conceive the primordial image. Nevertheless, it remains uncognizable by the individual, revealing itself only to the “pure subject of cognition,” which “is beyond all willing and all individuality.”

对于叔本华来说，观念是可见的东西，因为他完全把观念理解为我所描述为原初意象的那种东西。然而它仍然无法为个体所认识，只能对“纯粹的认识主体”显示它自己，“是高于一切意志和个性的”。

Hegel hypostatizes the idea completely and attributes to it alone real being. It is the “concept, the reality of the concept, and the union of both.” It is “eternal generation.” Lasswitz regards the idea as the “law showing the direction in which our experience should develop.” It is the “most certain and supreme reality.”For Cohen, it is the “concept’s awareness of itself,” the “foundation” of being.

黑格尔完全把观念实体化（hypostatizes）了，他赋予它唯一真实存在的属性。它是“概念、概念的现实以及两者的统一”。它是“永恒的普遍化”（eternal generation）。拉斯维兹（Lasswitz）把观念看作“指示我们的经验所应发展之方向的规律”。它是“最确定与最高的现实”。在科恩（Cohen）看来，观念是“概念对自身的意识”，存在的“根基”。

I do not want to pile up evidence for the primary nature of the idea. These quotations should suffice to show that it can be conceived as a fundamental, *a priori* factor. It derives this quality from its precursor—the primordial, symbolic image. Its secondary nature as something abstract and derived is a result of the rational elaboration to which the primordial image is subjected to fit it for rational use. The primordial image is an autochthonous psychological factor constantly repeating itself at all times and places, and the same might be said of the idea, although, on account of its rational nature, it is much more subject to modification by rational elaboration and formulations corresponding to local conditions and the spirit of the time. Since it is derived from the primordial image, a few philosophers ascribe a transcendent quality to it; this does not really belong to the idea as I conceive it, but rather to the primordial image, about which a timeless quality clings, being an integral component of the human mind everywhere from time immemorial. Its autonomous character is also derived from the primordial image, which is never “made” but is continually present, appearing in perception so spontaneously that it seems to strive for its own realization, being sensed by the mind as an active determinant. Such a view, however, is not general, and is presumably a question of *attitude* (q.v., also ).

我并无意再去更多地堆砌有关观念原初（primary）本质的证据。这些引文足以说明观念可被理解为一种基本的、先天的因素。它从其前身——原初的象征的意象中获得这种本质。它的作为某种抽象的和衍生的东西的次生本质，乃是理性精心编构的结果，原初意象为了适用于理性的使用都必须服从于这一编构。原初意象是一种自发性的心理因素，它反复出现于任何时代和任何地点，或许可以说观念也是这样，尽管根据理性的本质，观念已更多地受到理性精心编构的修正和程式化的限定，以便适应于当时的环境和时代精神。既然观念衍生于原初意象，所以某些哲学家便认为它具有一种超验的性质；其实这种性质并不属于观念，而是属于原初意象，它具有一种无时间性的特征，是一种有史以来出现在任何地方的人类心灵的不可或缺的组成部分。它的自发性特征也源于原初意象，该特征不可能“创造出来”而只能不断呈现出来，它是如此自发地呈现于知觉中，以致似乎在努力寻求自己的实现，使心灵觉得它就是一种主动的决定性因素。然而这种观点并不具有普遍性，或许只是一个态度的问题（参见该条，也可参见第7章）。

The idea is a psychological factor that not only determines thinking but, as a practical idea, also conditions feeling. As a general rule, I use the term *idea* only when speaking of the determination of thought in a thinking type, or of feeling in a feeling type. On the other hand, it would be terminologically correct to speak of an *a priori*determination by the primordial image in the case of an undifferentiated function. The dual nature of the idea as something both primary and derived is responsible for the fact that I sometimes use it promiscuously with primordial image. For the introverted attitude the idea is the prime mover; for the extraverted, a product.

观念作为一种心理因素，它不仅决定思维，而且也作为具体的观念（practical idea）制约情感。一般说来，我仅仅在论及思维类型中的思维决定性因素、或情感类型中的情感决定性因素时才使用观念一词。另一方面，处于一种未分化的功能的状况，我们说它是为原初意象所先天地决定的，这从用语上看才是正确的。观念既具有某种原生的又具有某种衍生的东西这一双重性正与以下事实相应，我有时将它与原初意象交错使用。对于内倾的态度来说，观念是原动力；而对于外倾的态度来说，它只不过是一种产品罢了。

## 24. 认同作用 (identifcation)

By this I mean a psychological process in which the personality is partially or totally *dissimilated* (v. *Assimilation*). Identification is an alienation of the subject from himself for the sake of the object, in which he is, so to speak, disguised. For example, identification with the father means, in practice, adopting all the father’s ways of behaving, as though the son were the same as the father and not a separate individuality. Identification differs from *imitation* in that it is an *unconscious* imitation, whereas imitation is a conscious copying. Imitation is an indispensable aid in developing the youthful personality. It is beneficial so long as it does not serve as a mere convenience and hinder the development of ways and means suited to the individual. Similarly, identification can be beneficial so long as the individual cannot go his own way. But when a better possibility presents itself, identification shows its morbid character by becoming just as great a hindrance as it was an unconscious help and support before. It now has a dissociative effect, splitting the individual into two mutually estranged personalities.

这个概念意指一种心理过程，在此过程中，人格部分地或整体地被异化（参见“同化”条）。认同作用是因为客体的缘故主体与他自身的一种疏离，可以说主体在疏离中被隐匿起来了。例如，对父亲的认同作用实际上意味着采纳了父亲的所有行为方式，好像儿子变得完全同父亲一样，而非一个分立的个体。认同作用不同于模仿，认同作用是一种无意识的模仿，而模仿则是一种有意识的复制。模仿对于青年人人格的发展是一种必不可少的助力。只要它并不仅仅作为一种顺应的方式而阻碍了恰当的个体的发展道路和发展方式，它便是有益的。同样地，只要个体仍未成熟，认同作用也是有益的。但是，一旦个体的可能性已较为成熟地出现，认同作用就会显示出它的病态特征，正像它在成为个体的极大阻碍之前曾经无意识地帮助与支持过个体一样。现在，它具有一种分裂的（dissociative）效用，将主体分裂为两种相互背离的人格。

Identification does not always apply to persons but also to things (e.g., a movement of some kind, a business, etc.) and to psychological functions. The latter kind is, in fact, particularly important. Identification then leads to the formation of a secondary character, the individual identifying with his best developed function to such an extent that he alienates himself very largely or even entirely from his original character, with the result that his true *individuality* (q.v.) falls into the unconscious. This is nearly always the rule with people who have one highly differentiated function. It is, in fact, a necessary transitional stage on the way to *individuation* (q.v.).

认同作用并非总是涉及到人，而且也涉及到事物（如某种运动，一项职务等等）和心理功能。事实上对某种心理功能的认同作用尤为重要。这样，认同作用导致了次生性格的形成，个体对他的获得最佳发展的功能的认同达到这样的程度，以致极大地与他自身相分离了，甚至完全脱离了他原生的性格，使他真正的个性（参阅该条）陷入了无意识中。对于那些具有高度分化的功能的人来说，这种状况几乎成了一种规律。事实上，它已成为个性化（indviduation）（参阅该条）道路上的一个必然的过渡阶段。

Identification with parents or the closest members of the family is a normal phenomenon in so far as it coincides with the *a priori family identity*. In this case it is better not to speak of *identification* but of *identity* (q.v.), a term that expresses the actual situation. Identification with members of the family differs from identity in that it is not an *a priori* but a secondary phenomenon arising in the following way. As the individual emerges from the original family identity, the process of adaptation and development brings him up against obstacles that cannot easily be mastered. A damming up of *libido* (q.v.) ensues, which seeks a regressive outlet. The regression reactivates the earlier states, among them the state of family identity. Identification with members of the family corresponds to this regressive revival of an identity that had almost been overcome. All identifications with persons come about in this way. Identification always has a purpose, namely, to obtain an advantage, to push aside an obstacle, or to solve a task in the way another individual would.

就其与一种先天的家族的同一性（a priori family identity）相一致而言，对双亲或家庭最亲近成员的认同是一种正常现象。在这种情形下，称之为认同作用并不恰当，而应称之为同一（参阅该条），同一表达的是实际的境况。对家庭成员的认同不同于与家庭成员的同一，前者并非先天的，而是次生的现象，生发于下列过程中：当个体的发展超出原先与家人的同一时，他的适应和发展过程就使他产生了一种他无法轻易克服的障碍。欲力（参阅该条）的积阻出现了，它要寻找一条退行的出路。退行复活了早年的状况，其中包括与家人相同一的状况。对家庭成员的认同作用正与这种与家人相同一的退行的复活相适应，而这种同一原本几乎是已经克服了的。所有对人的认同作用都以这种方式出现。认同作用总有一个目的，即获得一种优势，弃置障碍，或用效法于另一个体的方式来完成一项任务。

## 25. 同一 (identity)

I use the term *identity* to denote a psychological conformity. It is always an unconscious phenomenon since a conscious conformity would necessarily involve a consciousness of two dissimilar things, and, consequently, a separation of subject and object, in which case the identity would already have been abolished. Psychological identity presupposes that it is unconscious. It is a characteristic of the primitive mentality and the real foundation of *participation mystique* (q.v.), which is nothing but a relic of the original non-differentiation of subject and object, and hence of the primordial unconscious state. It is also a characteristic of the mental state of early infancy, and, finally, of the unconscious of the civilized adult, which, in so far as it has not become a content of consciousness, remains in a permanent state of identity with objects. Identity with the parents provides the basis for subsequent *identification* (q.v.) with them; on it also depends the possibility of *projection* (q.v.) and *introjection*(q.v.).

我用同一一词来意指一种心理上的一致。同一总是一种无意识的现象，因为意识的一致必然包涵对两种不同的东西的意识，因而也就包含了主体与客体之间的分离，在此情况下，同一就已经被取消了。心理上的同一以同一是无意识的为先决条件。它具有原初精神的特征，以神秘参与（参阅该条）作为真正的基础，这只不过是原初的主体与客体处于未分化状态的心理遗迹，因此是一种原初的无意识状态。它也具有较早的婴儿期的精神状况的特征，最后，在成年的文明人那里，它具有无意识的特征，就其未能转化为意识的内容而言，它仍然永久保持着与客体同一的状况。与双亲的同一为继续发展对双亲的认同作用（参阅该条）提供了基础；同样，投射（projection）（参阅该条）与内向投射（introjection）（参阅该条）的可能性也依赖于同一。

Identity is primarily an unconscious conformity with objects. It is not an *equation*, but an *a priori likeness* which was never the object of consciousness. Identity is responsible for the naïve assumption that the psychology of one man is like that of another, that the same motives occur everywhere, that what is agreeable to me must obviously be pleasurable for others, that what I find immoral must also be immoral for them, and so on. It is also responsible for the almost universal desire to correct in others what most needs correcting in oneself. Identity, too, forms the basis of suggestion and psychic infection. Identity is particularly evident in pathological cases, for instance in paranoic ideas of reference, where one’s own subjective contents are taken for granted in others. But identity also makes possible a consciously *collective* (q.v.), social *attitude* (q.v.), which found its highest expression in the Christian ideal of brotherly love.

同一主要是一种与客体的无意识的保持一致。它并非是一种等同（equation），而是一种不可能成为意识的对象的先天的相似性（a priori likeness）。同一依赖于这样一些天真的假设，认为一个人的心理类似于另一个人的心理，同样的动机是普遍有效的，我所赞成的东西也显然为他人所喜爱，我所认为邪恶的东西他人也必定认为邪恶，等等。同一也依赖于这种近乎普遍的愿望，在他人那里最需要纠正的东西也是自己所需要纠正的。同一也构成暗示感受性及心理感染的基础。在病理学病例中，同一表现得格外明显，例如，在偏执妄想狂有关感应和迫害的妄想中，病患的主观内容被他理所当然地认定为别人也正是这么认定的。然而，同一也使有意识的集体性（参阅该条）和社会性的态度成为可能，这在兄弟之爱的基督教理想中找到了它们最崇高的表现形式。

## 26. 意象 (image)

When I speak of “image” in this book, I do not mean the psychic reflection of an external object, but a concept derived from poetic usage, namely, a figure of fancy or *fantasy-image*, which is related only indirectly to the perception of an external object. This image depends much more on unconscious fantasy activity, and as the product of such activity it appears more or less abruptly in consciousness, somewhat in the manner of a vision or hallucination, but without possessing the morbid traits that are found in a clinical picture. The image has the psychological character of a fantasy idea and never the quasi-real character of an hallucination, i.e., it never takes the place of reality, and can always be distinguished from sensuous reality by the fact that it is an “inner” image. As a rule, it is not a projection in space, although in exceptional cases it can appear in exteriorized form. This mode of manifestation must be termed *archaic* (q.v.) when it is not primarily pathological, though that would not by any means do away with its archaic character. On the primitive level, however, the inner image can easily be projected in space as a vision or an auditory hallucination without being a pathological phenomenon.

我在本书中所讨论的意象，并不意指那种对外在客体的心理反映，而是来自诗学运用中的一个概念，即幻想的形象或幻想-意象（phantasy-image），它仅仅间接地涉及到对于外在客体的知觉。这种意象更多地依赖于无意识的幻想活动，作为其活动的产品，它或许有时以梦幻或幻觉（hallucination）的方式，出其不意地出现于意识中，但并不具有那种出现在临床治疗图像中的病理学特征。意象具有幻想性观念的心理特性，但从不具有幻觉的准-现实性特征，即是说它从不会去取代现实，它总是能够凭借它是一种“内在的”意象这一事实使自己与感官现实区别开来。通常，它不是一种空间上的投射，尽管在特殊的情形中，它能以某种外化的形式呈现出来。当这种表现模式本质上并非是病态的时——尽管这样也决不能排除它的古代的特征——那它就必然被称之为古代的。然而，在原初的层面上，内在的意象能易于在空间上被投射为一种幻觉或一种听觉幻象，这并不是一种病态现象。

Although, as a rule, no reality-value attaches to the image, this can at times actually increase its importance for psychic life, since it then has a greater *psychological* value, representing an inner reality which often far outweighs the importance of external reality. In this case the *orientation*(q.v.) of the individual is concerned less with adaptation to reality than with adaptation to inner demands.

通常，虽然意象并不具有现实-价值，但有时这实际上增加了它对于精神生活的重要性，因为它具有更大的心理价值，体现了一种常常远远超出外在现实的重要性的内在现实。在这种情况下，个体的定向很少涉及到对外在现实的适应而更多地涉及到适应于其内在的要求。

The inner image is a complex structure made up of the most varied material from the most varied sources. It is no conglomerate, however, but a homogeneous product with a meaning of its own. The image is a *condensed expression of the psychic situation as a whole*, and not merely, nor even predominately, of unconscious contents pure and simple. It undoubtedly does express unconscious contents, but not the whole of them, only those that are momentarily constellated. This constellation is the result of the spontaneous activity of the unconscious on the one hand and of the momentary conscious situation on the other, which always stimulates the activity of relevant subliminal material and at the same time inhibits the irrelevant. Accordingly the image is an expression of the unconscious as well as the conscious situation of the moment. The interpretation of its meaning, therefore, can start neither from the conscious alone nor from the unconscious alone, but only from their reciprocal relationship.

内在意象是一个复杂的结构，由来自最多样根源的无数不同的材料建构而成。但是，它并非一个大杂烩，而是具有其自身意义的同质性产物。意象是作为整体的心理情境的浓缩性表现，它并不仅仅是，甚至也并不主要是纯粹而简单的无意识内容的表现。毫无疑问，它的确表达了无意识的内容，但并非无意识的全部内容，而仅仅是那些瞬间聚集起来的内容。这种聚集一方面是无意识的自发活动的结果；另一方面是瞬间的意识状态造成的结果，它总是激起相关的阈下材料的活动，而同时也抑制不相关的材料的活动。因此，意象既是一种无意识的表现，也是一种暂时的意识状况。因而对其意义的阐释既不能以从无意识也不能从意识开始，而只能从它们的相互关系开始。

I call the image *primordial* when it possesses an *archaic*(q.v.) character. I speak of its archaic character when the image is in striking accord with familiar mythological motifs. It then expresses material primarily derived from the *collective unconscious* (q.v.), and indicates at the same time that the factors influencing the conscious situation of the moment are *collective* (q.v.) rather than personal. A *personal* image has neither an archaic character nor a collective significance, but expresses contents of the *personal unconscious* (q.v.) and a personally conditioned conscious situation.

当意象具有一种古代的特征时，我称之为原初的（primordial）。当意象与熟悉的神话主题存在惊人的一致性时，我说它具有远古的特征。它所表现的材料主要来自集体无意识（collective unconsious，参见该条），同时也表明，它对瞬间的意识状况产生影响的因素是集体性的而非个人性的。个人的意象既不具有古代的特征，也不具有集体的含义，而只是表达了个人无意识的内容和为个人所限定的意识状况。

The primordial image, elsewhere also termed *archetype*, is always collective, i.e., it is at least common to entire peoples or epochs. In all probability the most important mythological motifs are common to all times and races; I have, in fact, been able to demonstrate a whole series of motifs from Greek mythology in the dreams and fantasies of pure-bred Negroes suffering from mental disorders.

原初意象——在其他地方也称之为原型——总是集体的，即它至少对整个民族或时代来讲是共同的。最重要的神话主题在其全部可能性方面对所有的时代和种族而言是共同的；事实上，我已在患精神错乱病症的纯血统黑人的梦与幻想中证明了来自希腊神话的全部神话主题系列。

From the scientific, causal standpoint the primordial image can be conceived as a mnemic deposit, an imprint or *engram* (Semon), which has arisen through the condensation of countless processes of a similar kind. In this respect it is a precipitate and, therefore, a typical basic form, of certain ever-recurring psychic experiences. As a mythological motif, it is a continually effective and recurrent expression that reawakens certain psychic experiences or else formulates them in an appropriate way. From this standpoint it is a psychic expression of the physiological and anatomical disposition. If one holds the view that a particular anatomical structure is a product of environmental conditions, working on living matter, then the primordial image, in its constant and universal distribution, would be the product of equally constant and universal influences from without, which must, therefore, act like a natural law. One could in this way relate myths to nature, as for instance solar myths to the daily rising and setting of the sun, or to the equally obvious change of the seasons, and this has in fact been done by many mythologists, and still is. But that leaves the question unanswered why the sun and its apparent motions do not appear direct and undisguised as a content of the myths. The fact that the sun or the moon or the meteorological processes appear, at the very least, in allegorized form points to an independent collaboration of the psyche, which in that case cannot be merely a product or stereotype of environmental conditions. For whence would it draw the capacity to adopt a standpoint outside sense perception? How, for that matter, could it be at all capable of any performance more or other than the mere corroboration of the evidence of the senses? In view of such questions Semon’s naturalistic and causalistic engram theory no longer suffices. We are forced to assume that the given structure of the brain does not owe its peculiar nature merely to the influence of surrounding conditions, but also and just as much to the peculiar and autonomous quality of living matter, i.e., to a law inherent in life itself. The given constitution of the organism, therefore, is on the one hand a product of external conditions, while on the other it is determined by the intrinsic nature of living matter. Accordingly, the primordial image is related just as much to certain palpable, self-perpetuating, and continually operative natural processes as it is to certain inner determinants of psychic life and of life in general. The organism confronts light with a new structure, the eye, and the psyche confronts the natural process with a symbolic image, which apprehends it in the same way as the eye catches the light. And just as the eye bears witness to the peculiar and spontaneous creative activity of living matter, the primordial image expresses the unique and unconditioned creative power of the psyche.

从科学的因果关系的观点来看，原初意象被视为一种记忆的沉淀（mnemic deposit），一种印迹或记忆痕迹（engram，赛蒙语），它由无数种相类似的过程浓缩而成。就此而言，它是一种凝结或沉淀，因而是某种一再重复出现的心理经验的典型的基本形式。作为一种神话主题，它是一种恒久有效的和不断出现的表现形式，它重新唤醒某些心理经验，并且以一种恰当的方式将心理经验程式化。从这种观点来看，原初意象是一种对生理学的和解剖学的配置的心理表达。如果人们赞成这样的观点，即某一特定的解剖学上的结构是环境条件作用于生命物的结果，那么处于恒久而普遍的分布状态的原初意象就应该是同样受到恒久而普遍的外在影响的结果，因而它必然依照自然规律来行动。以此方式人们能把神话与自然联系起来，例如太阳的神话与太阳每天的升起和落下的关系，或者与同样显著的季节变化之间的关系。但是，这仍然会留下难以回答的问题，为什么太阳及其明显的运行并没有直接地和不加掩饰地显现为神话的内容。太阳、月亮或气象现象极少以寓言的形式显现这一事实指明了心理协作活动的独立性，在此事实中，它并不只是环境条件的产物或体现。因为，它从何处获取一种超出于感官知觉之外的观点的心理能力？就此而言，它最终怎么可能具有能够随意行使的更多地超出纯粹感官事实确证的能力？面对这些问题，赛蒙自然主义的和因果论的“记忆痕迹”理论就不再有效了。我们不得不设想，大脑既定结构的特殊本质并不能仅仅归结为周围环境的影响，而且应该且更多地归结为特殊的、自主的生命物的本质表现，即归结为内在于生命本身的规律。因此，有机体的既定构成一方面是外在环境的产物，而另一方面又为生命物的内在本质所决定。据此，原初意象既与某种明显可见的、永恒不变的和持续运行的自然过程相联系，同时也与某种心理生命和一般生命的内在决定性因素相联系。有机体用一种新的结构——眼睛——面对光亮，而心理则用一种象征的意象面对自然过程，它以同样的方式将自然过程理解为捕捉光亮的眼睛。正像眼睛能够证实生命物特殊而自主的创造性活动一样，原初意象也表现了心理独一无二的和不受限制的创造力。

The primordial image is thus a condensation of the living process. It gives a co-ordinating and coherent meaning both to sensuous and to inner perceptions, which at first appear without order or connection, and in this way frees psychic energy from its bondage to sheer uncomprehended perception. At the same time, it links the energies released by the perception of stimuli to a definite meaning, which then guides action along paths corresponding to this meaning. It releases unavailable, dammed-up energy by leading the mind back to nature and canalizing sheer instinct into mental forms.

因此，原初意象是对生命过程的一种浓缩。它给予了感官知觉与内在精神知觉以同等的和固有的意义，它最初显得既无规则又无联系，以此方式使心理能量从纯粹未被理解的知觉的束缚中释放出来。与此同时，它也联系着那些由于刺激而感受到某种确切的意义因而得到释放的能量，于是，沿着与这种意义相适应的线路它引导了行为。通过把精神引回到自然、把纯粹的本能引入到心理形式，原初意象便释放了难以利用的被抑制的能量。

The primordial image is the precursor of the *idea* (q.v.), and its matrix. By detaching it from the *concretism* (q.v.) peculiar and necessary to the primordial image, reason develops it into a concept—i.e., an idea which differs from all other concepts in that it is not a datum of experience but is actually the underlying principle of all experience. The idea derives this quality from the primordial image, which, as an expression of the specific structure of the brain, gives every experience a definite form.

原初意象是观念的前身，它的母体。通过把原初意象从特殊的具体化中分离出来，这对它来说是十分必要的，理性将它发展为概念——即区别于所有其他概念的观念，亦即它并非作为经验的材料，而实际上是作为所有经验的基础的原则。观念从原初意象中衍生出来的这种性质，作为大脑特殊结构的表现形式，它赋予每一种经验以特定的形式。

The degree of psychological efficacy of the primordial image is determined by the *attitude* (q.v.) of the individual. If the attitude is introverted, the natural consequence of the withdrawal of *libido* (q.v.) from the external object is the heightened significance of the internal object, i.e., thought. This leads to a particularly intense development of thought along the lines unconsciously laid down by the primordial image. In this way the primordial image comes to the surface indirectly. The further development of thought leads to the idea, which is nothing other than the primordial image intellectually formulated. Only the development of the counter-function can take the idea further—that is to say, once the idea has been grasped intellectually, it strives to become effective in life. It therefore calls upon *feeling*(q.v.), which in this case is much less differentiated and more concretistic than thinking. Feeling is impure and, because undifferentiated, still fused with the *unconscious*. Hence the individual is unable to unite the contaminated feeling with the idea. At this juncture the primordial image appears in the inner field of vision as a *symbol* (q.v.), and, by virtue of its concrete nature, embraces the undifferentiated, concretized feeling, but also, by virtue of its intrinsic significance, embraces the idea, of which it is indeed the matrix, and so unites the two. In this way the primordial image acts as a mediator, once again proving its redeeming power, a power it has always possessed in the various religions. What Schopenhauer says of the idea, therefore, I would apply rather to the primordial image, since, as I have already explained, the idea is not something absolutely *a priori*, but must also be regarded as secondary and derived (v. *Idea)*.

原初意象心理功效的大小取决于个体的态度。倘若其态度是内倾的，自然产生的结果是欲力从外在客体的撤回，使内在的客体即思想的意义得到强化。沿着原初意象所无意识地勾勒的这条线索，将导致思想获得极大的发展。由此下去，原初意象就间接地达到了表面。思想的进一步发展将通向观念，观念不过是被理性地程式化了的原初意象罢了。只有相对立的功能（counter-function）的发展才可能进一步地获得观念——也就是说，一旦观念被理性地掌握时，它就会努力变得对生命有影响力。因此它唤起了情感，在这种状况下，情感的分化程度远低于思维，也比思维更具体化。由于其未分化的情感是混合的，它仍然与无意识混合在一起。所以，个体不可能使如此构成的情感与观念统一起来。在这个时候，原初意象作为象征出现在幻觉的内在领域，凭借它的具体性质，包含了未分化的和具体化的情感，而且，凭借它内在的含义，也包含了观念，这正是它所具有的母性，以致能把观念与情感统一起来。以此方式，原初意象扮演着调解者的角色，它一再提供救赎的力量，在各种宗教中它总是具有这种力量。因此，叔本华对观念所作的论述，我将确切地运用于原初意象，因为像我已经阐释过的那样，观念并非是某种绝对先天的东西，而必然被视为是次生的和衍生的（参见“观念”条）。

In the following passage from Schopenhauer, I would ask the reader to replace the word “idea” by “primordial image,” and he will then be able to understand my meaning.

在下面引自叔本华的文字中，如果读者将“观念”一词替换成“原初意象”，读者就会明白我的意思了。

> It \[the idea\] is never cognized by the individual as such, but only by him who has raised himself beyond all willing and all individuality to the pure subject of cognition. Thus it is attainable only by the genius, or by the man who, inspired by works of genius, has succeeded in elevating his powers of pure cognition into a temper akin to genius. It is, therefore, not absolutely but only conditionally communicable, since the idea conceived and reproduced in a work of art, for instance, appeals to each man only according to the measure of his own intellectual worth.
>
> “观念”决不能被个体本身所认识，而只能为那种人所认识，他把自己提升到了超越所有意志和所有个性的纯粹认识主体的高度。因而观念只能为天才或者那种人所获得，由于受天才的产品的激发，他能成功地将纯粹认识的能力提升为一种近乎天才的心境。因此，观念并非绝对地不可传达，而只能有条件地传达，举例来说，因为一件艺术品中所蕴涵的和再建的观念，仅仅对那种自身拥有相当理智能力的人才有感染力。
>
> The idea is the unity that falls into multiplicity on account of the temporal and spatial form of our intuitive apprehension.
>
> 观念是统一体，它根据我们直觉领悟的时间和空间的形式将陷入杂多的东西统一起来。
>
> The concept is like an inert receptacle, in which the things one puts into it lie side by side, but from which no more can be taken out than was put in. The idea, on the other hand, develops, in him who has comprehended it, notions which are new in relation to the concept of the same name: it is like a living, self-developing organism endowed with generative power, constantly bringing forth something that was not put into it.
>
> 概念好比一个死气沉沉的容器，其中人们放进去的东西一个紧接一个，但却无法再取出什么也不能再放进什么。观念则不然，谁理解了它，它就发展为与同名的概念处于新的联系中的总念（notions）：观念就像一个有生命的、自行-发展着的有机体，被赋予了增殖的能力，不断产生某种先前所没有放进去的东西。

Schopenhauer clearly discerned that the “idea,” or the primordial image as I define it, cannot be produced in the same way that a concept or an “idea” in the ordinary sense can (Kant defines an “idea” as a concept “formed from notions”). There clings to it an element beyond rational formulation, rather like Schopenhauer’s “temper akin to genius,” which simply means a state of feeling. One can get to the primordial image from the idea only because the path that led to the idea passes over the summit into the counterfunction, feeling.

叔本华清楚地辨识了“观念”或我所界定的原初意象，它不能按照平常意义上那种产生概念或“观念”的方式产生出来（康德将“观念”定义为“从总念所形成的概念”）。这里有一种超越于理性程式的因素依附于观念，它更类似于叔本华所说的“近乎天才的心境”，简单说来，这就是指情感的状态。一个人之所以能从观念到达原初意象，只是因为通向观念的道路在翻越了观念的顶点后，就进入到了其相对立的功能——情感之中。

The primordial image has one great advantage over the clarity of the idea, and that is its vitality. It is a self-activating organism, “endowed with generative power.” The primordial image is an inherited organization of psychic energy, an ingrained system, which not only gives expression to the energic process but facilitates its operation. It shows how the energic process has run its unvarying course from time immemorial, while simultaneously allowing a perpetual repetition of it by means of an apprehension or psychic grasp of situations so that life can continue into the future. It is thus the necessary counterpart of *instinct* (q.v.), which is a purposive mode of action presupposing an equally purposive and meaningful grasp of the momentary situation. This apprehension is guaranteed by the pre-existent primordial image. It represents the practical formula without which the apprehension of a new situation would be impossible.

原初意象具有某种超越于观念的清晰的巨大优势，这就是它的生命力。它是一种自身充满活力的有机体，“被赋予了增殖的能力”。原初意象是一种内在固有的心理能量的组织，一个根深蒂固的系统，它不仅能对能量过程做出表现，而且具有使其运作的能力。它显示出亘古以来能量过程如何依循不变的线路运作，同时又借助于理解或对情境的心理把握，即时地允许永不停息的对它的重复，以便生命能延伸至未来。因此，它是本能必需的对应物，本能是一种有目的的行为模式，以一种同样有目的地对即时情境作出有意义的把握为前提条件。而这种理解或把握得由预先存在的意象来保证。原初意象表现为实用的程式，没有这种程式就不可能理解新的情境。

### 26a. IMAGO V. SUBJECTIVE LEVEL.

## 27. 个体 (individual)

The psychological individual is characterized by a peculiar and in some respects unique psychology. The peculiar nature of the individual psyche appears less in its elements than in its complex formations. The psychological individual, or his *individuality* (q.v.), has an *a priori* unconscious existence, but exists consciously only so far as a consciousness of his peculiar nature is present, i.e., so far as there exists a conscious distinction from other individuals. The psychic individuality is given *a priori* as a correlate of the physical individuality, although, as observed, it is at first unconscious. A conscious process of *differentiation* (q.v.), or *individuation* (q.v.), is needed to bring the individuality to consciousness, i.e., to raise it out of the state of *identity* (q.v.) with the object. The identity of the individuality with the object is synonymous with its unconsciousness. If the individuality is unconscious, there is no psychological individual but merely a collective psychology of consciousness. The unconscious individuality is then projected on the object, and the object, in consequence, possesses too great a value and acts as too powerful a determinant.

心理上的个体具有某种特殊的和某些方面独一无二的心理特征。个体心理的特殊性很少表现在它的基本要素中，而更多地表现在其复杂的心理构成中。心理个体或个性具有一种先天的无意识存在，但只有当他对其特殊本质的意识出现时，即出现一种与其他个体的有意识的区分时，它才是有意识的存在。尽管心理个性正如我们所观察到的那样最初是无意识的，但它作为一种身体个性的相关物是先天地被给定的。其分化的意识的过程或个体化过程需要将个性带向意识，即将个性提升到超脱与客体同一的状态。个性与客体同一和个性与无意识同一是一个意思。如果个性是无意识的就不会有心理个体出现，而只是一种集体的意识心理。这样，无意识个性被投射到客体中，结果是客体获得了极大的价值，成为强有力的决定性因素。

## 28. 个性 (individuality)

By individuality I mean the peculiarity and singularity of the individual in every psychological respect. Everything that is not *collective* (q.v.) is individual, everything in fact that pertains only to one individual and not to a larger group of individuals. Individuality can hardly be said to pertain to the psychic elements themselves, but only to their peculiar and unique grouping and combination (v. *Individual*).

我把个性理解为个体所有心理方面的特殊性与独一性。凡是不属于集体性的东西以及一切确实只从属于某个人而非从属于一大群人的东西都是个体的。个性很难说从属于他们本身的心理要素，而仅仅从属于这些心理要素特殊而独特的聚集与组合（参见“个体”条）。

## 29. 个性化 (individuation)

29. INDIVIDUATION. The concept of individuation plays a large role in our psychology. In general, it is the process by which individual beings are formed and differentiated; in particular, it is the development of the psychological *individual* (q.v.) as a being distinct from the general, collective psychology. Individuation, therefore, is a process of *differentiation* (q.v.), having for its goal the development of the individual personality.

个性化概念在我们的心理学中扮演着不可轻视的角色。一般来说，它是个体由此得以形成和得以区分的过程；它尤其是指心理个体的发展，使个体从普遍的集体心理中分化出来。因此，个性化是一个分化的过程，它的目标是个体人格的发展。

Individuation is a natural necessity inasmuch as its prevention by a levelling down to collective standards is injurious to the vital activity of the individual. Since *individuality* (q.v.) is a prior psychological and physiological datum, it also expresses itself in psychological ways. Any serious check to individuality, therefore, is an artificial stunting. It is obvious that a social group consisting of stunted individuals cannot be a healthy and viable institution; only a society that can preserve its internal cohesion and collective values, while at the same time granting the individual the greatest possible freedom, has any prospect of enduring vitality. As the individual is not just a single, separate being, but by his very existence presupposes a collective relationship, it follows that the process of individuation must lead to more intense and broader collective relationships and not to isolation.

由于要努力避免保持在集体性的同一水平上，以免个体的生命活动受到伤害，个性化就是自然必需的。既然个性是一种先天的心理和生理上的事实，那么它也以心理的方式表现自己。因此，任何对个性的严厉的限制都是一种人为的阻碍。一个由受到阻碍的个体所构成的社会集群不可能是健全的和有活力的；只有能够保持个体的内在统一和集体的价值、同时又给个体以最大可能的自由的社会才具有生机勃勃的前景。既然个体不只是单一的、分立的存在，它的真正存在必须以集体联系为先决条件，那么个性化的过程必然导致更深更广的集体联系，而不是走向封闭隔绝。

Individuation is closely connected with the *transcendent function* (v. *Symbol*, par. 828), since this function creates individual lines of development which could never be reached by keeping to the path prescribed by collective norms.

个性化与超验功能（transcendent function，参见“象征”条）密切相关，因为这种功能创造了个体的发展线路，倘若持守集体准则所规范的道路，就决不能获得这种发展。

Under no circumstances can individuation be the sole aim of psychological education. Before it can be taken as a goal, the educational aim of adaptation to the necessary minimum of collective norms must first be attained. If a plant is to unfold its specific nature to the full, it must first be able to grow in the soil in which it is planted.

在任何情况下，个性化都决不是心理教育的唯一目的。在它可能被当作目的之前，必须首先达到对集体规范的必需的最小限度的适应这一教育的目的。一株能够充分显露它特殊属性的植物首先必须能够生长在它所植根的土壤上。

Individuation is always to some extent opposed to collective norms, since it means separation and differentiation from the general and a building up of the particular—not a particularity that is *sought out*, but one that is already ingrained in the psychic constitution. The opposition to the collective norm, however, is only apparent, since closer examination shows that the individual standpoint is not *antagonistic* to it, but only *differently oriented*. The individual way can never be directly opposed to the collective norm, because the opposite of the collective norm could only be another, but contrary, norm. But the individual way can, by definition, never be a norm. A norm is the product of the totality of individual ways, and its justification and beneficial effect are contingent upon the existence of individual ways that need from time to time to orient to a norm. A norm serves no purpose when it possesses absolute validity. A real conflict with the collective norm arises only when an individual way is raised to a norm, which is the actual aim of extreme individualism. Naturally this aim is pathological and inimical to life. It has, accordingly, nothing to do with individuation, which, though it may strike out on an individual bypath, precisely on that account needs the norm for its *orientation*(q.v.) to society and for the vitally necessary relationship of the individual to society. Individuation, therefore, leads to a natural esteem for the collective norm, but if the orientation is exclusively collective the norm becomes increasingly superfluous and morality goes to pieces. The more a man’s life is shaped by the collective norm, the greater is his individual immorality.

个性化总是在某种程度上与集体规范相对立，因为它意味着从一般性中脱离和分化出来，意味着一种特殊性的建立；这种特殊性并不是要我们去刻意追求，而是原本就植根于心理构成之中。然而，与集体规范的对立仅仅是外显的，因为较为细致的观察表明，个体的立场并非与它是对抗性的，而只是定向不同罢了。个体方式从不与集体规范直接对立，因为与集体规范对立的只能是另一种而且是相矛盾的规范。但个体方式就其定义来看从不可能成为一种规范。所谓规范只能产生于个体方式的总和，它的正当性和有益性依个体方式的存在而定，依个体随时定向于某一规范的需要而定。当一种规范具有绝对的有效性时，它就丧失了任何目的。只有当个体的方式上升为一种规范——成为极端个人主义的实际目的——时，它与集体规范的实际冲突才会出现。当然，这种目的是病态的、与生命相抵触的。因此它与个性化无关，尽管它可能冲创出一条个人的小路来，但正是由于这一原因，它才需要用以确定其社会的定向、确定个体与社会至关重要的必然性联系的规范。所以，个性化导致对集体规范的自然尊重，但是，倘若这种定向是绝对集体性的，那么规范就会日益成为多余的，道德就破碎了。人的生命越是受到集体规范的铸造，其个体的堕落就越是可怕。

Individuation is practically the same as the development of consciousness out of the original state of *identity* (q.v.). It is thus an extension of the sphere of consciousness, an enriching of conscious psychological life.

个性化实际上与有意识地超出原初同一状态的发展是同一过程。因此它是一种意识领域的延伸，使意识的心理生命变得极为丰富。

## 30. 劣势功能 (inferior function)

This term is used to denote the function that lags behind in the process of *differentiation*(q.v.). Experience shows that it is practically impossible, owing to adverse circumstances in general, for anyone to develop all his psychological functions simultaneously. The demands of society compel a man to apply himself first and foremost to the differentiation of the function with which he is best equipped by nature, or which will secure him the greatest social success. Very frequently, indeed as a general rule, a man identifies more or less completely with the most favoured and hence the most developed function. It is this that gives rise to the various psychological *types* (q.v.). As a consequence of this one-sided development, one or more functions are necessarily retarded. These functions may properly be called *inferior* in a psychological but not psychopathological sense, since they are in no way morbid but merely backward as compared with the favoured function.

这个概念被用来表示那种在分化的过程中残留下来的功能。经验表明，由于一般环境的不利，任何人要想使他的所有心理功能同时获得发展几乎是不可能的。社会要求迫使每一个人首先和主要使那种最具有天赋或能确保他获得最大的社会成功的功能分化出来。确实，作为一种普遍的规律，一个人通常总是完全与那种最宠爱的因而也是获得最大发展的功能相同一。这就出现了各种不同的心理类型。作为这种片面发展的结果，一种或更多的功能必然在发展中遗留下来。这些功能或许可以在心理学而并非心理病理学的意义上被恰当地称为劣势功能，因为这些延滞发展的功能绝不是病态的，而只是相较于优势的功能处于落后的状况。

Although the inferior function may be conscious as a phenomenon, its true significance nevertheless remains unrecognized. It behaves like many repressed or insufficiently appreciated contents, which are partly conscious and partly unconscious, just as, very often, one knows a certain person from his outward appearance but does not know him as he really is. Thus in normal cases the inferior function remains conscious, at least in its effects; but in a neurosis it sinks wholly or in part into the unconscious. For, to the degree that the greater share of *libido* (q.v.) is taken up by the favoured function, the inferior function undergoes a regressive development; it reverts to the *archaic* (q.v.) stage and becomes incompatible with the conscious, favoured function. When a function that should normally be conscious lapses into the unconscious, its specific energy passes into the unconscious too. A function such as feeling possesses the energy with which it is endowed by nature; it is a well-organized living system that cannot under any circumstances be wholly deprived of its energy. So with the inferior function: the energy left to it passes into the unconscious and activates it in an unnatural way, giving rise to *fantasies* (q.v.) on a level with the archaicized function. In order to extricate the inferior function from the unconscious by analysis, the unconscious fantasy formations that have now been activated must be brought to the surface. The conscious realization of these fantasies brings the inferior function to consciousness and makes further development possible.

虽然劣势功能作为一种现象或许可意识到，但它的真正意义仍然处于未被认识的状态。它像许多受到压抑或难以辨识的内容一样地活动，部分地是意识的部分地是无意识的，正如常所见到的那样，人们能从其外观上认识一个人，但并不知道他的真实内心。因此在正常情况下，劣势功能仍然可以意识到，至少可以意识到它的影响；但在心理病患者那里，它完全或部分地沉入了无意识。因为，一旦当欲力的分配极大地达到为优势功能所获取的程度，劣势功能就会经历一种退行的发展；它返回到古代的状态，变得与意识的优势功能无法相容。当一种功能在正常情况下从意识的陷入到无意识的时候，其特有的能量也同时过渡到无意识的。例如情感这种功能所具有的能量是天性赋予它的；它是一种组织完好的有生命的系统，无论何种情况下，其能量都不可能被完全剥夺。劣势功能也是如此：残留给它的能量进入了无意识，以一种反常的方式可以激活它，在相应于古代化的功能的水平上，导致幻想的产生。要想借助分析把劣势功能从无意识中释放出来，就必须让现在已经被激活的这些无意识幻想的构成浮现于表面。倘若这些幻想获得意识上的实现，就会把劣势功能也带入意识的层面，使其具有进一步发展的可能性。

## 31. 本能 (instinct)

When I speak of instinct in this work or elsewhere, I mean what is commonly understood by this word, namely, an *impulsion* towards certain activities. The impulsion can come from an inner or outer stimulus which triggers off the mechanism of instinct psychically, or from organic sources which lie outside the sphere of psychic causality. Every psychic phenomenon is instinctive that does not arise from voluntary causation but from dynamic impulsion, irrespective of whether this impulsion comes directly from organic, extra-psychic sources, or from energies that are merely released by voluntary intention—in the latter case with the qualification that the end-result exceeds the effect voluntarily intended. In my view, all psychic processes whose energies are not under conscious control are instinctive. Thus *affects* (q.v.) are as much instinctive processes as they are *feeling* (q.v.) processes. Psychic processes which under ordinary circumstances are functions of the *will* (q.v.), and thus entirely under conscious control, can, in abnormal circumstances, become instinctive processes when supplied with unconscious energy. This phenomenon occurs whenever the sphere of consciousness is restricted by the repression of incompatible contents, or when, as a result of fatigue, intoxication, or morbid cerebral conditions in general, an *abaissement du niveau mental* (Janet) ensues—when, in a word, the most strongly feeling-toned processes are no longer, or not yet, under conscious control. Processes that were once conscious but in time have become *automatized* I would reckon among the automatic processes rather than the instinctive. Nor do they normally behave like instincts, since in normal circumstances they never appear as impulsions. They do so only when supplied with an energy which is foreign to them.

无论在本书中还是其他地方，当我谈及本能时，我意指该词被普遍理解的意义，即一种朝向某些活动的冲动。冲动可能来自于外在的或内在的刺激，这种刺激从心理上触发了本能的机制，或者来自于超出心理因果律（psychic causality）范围的器官的根源。每一种心理现象都是本能的，它们并非产生于意志上的原因，而是产生于动力性的冲动，不管这种冲动直接根植于器官，因而具有超心理的源头，还是来自意志目的影响下所释放的能量——在后一种情况下，必须有一个条件，那就是最终的结果超越了意志所预料的影响。在我看来，所有那些其能量不受意识控制的心理过程都是本能的。因而感情既属于本能过程，又属于情感过程。在正常情况下原本作为意志功能的心理过程——因而它完全处于意识的控制下，在反常情况下当其获得无意识的能量时可能变成本能的过程。这种现象出现在对不相容的内容的压抑严格限制了意识的活动范围的地方，或者出现在疲劳、醉酒或一般的脑部病变所导致的精神层面降低（雅内语）的地方——换句话来说，出现在那些具有最强有力的情感色调的过程不再或仍然尚未受到意识控制的地方。那些曾经是意识的但现在已经变成自动的的过程，我将它们归入自动的过程而不是归入本能的过程。从正常的眼光来看，它们的行为并不像本能那样，因为在一般状况下，它们从不显示为冲动。只有当获得一种它们所陌生的能量时才显示为冲动。

## 32. 理智、理性 (intellect)

I call *directed thinking* (q.v.) intellect.

我把理智称之为定向的思维（directed thinking）。

## 33. 内向投射 (introjection)

This term was introduced by Avenarius to correspond with *projection* (q.v.). The expulsion of a subjective content into an object, which is what Avenarius meant, is expressed equally well by the term projection, and it would therefore be better to reserve the term projection for this process. Ferenczi has now defined introjection as the opposite of projection, namely as an indrawing of the object into the subjective sphere of interest, while projection is an expulsion of subjective contents into the object. “Whereas the paranoiac expels from his ego emotions which have become disagreeable, the neurotic helps himself to as large a portion of the outer world as his ego can ingest, and makes this an object of unconscious fantasies.” The first mechanism is projection, the second introjection. Introjection is a sort of “diluting process,” an “expansion of the circle of interest.” According to Ferenczi, the process is a normal one.

该词为阿芬那留斯（Avenarius）所引入，用来与投射（projection）相对应。阿芬那留斯所意指的某种主观的内容被驱入了客体同样也可恰当地用投射一词来表达，因此适应于这一过程的投射一词也得以很好地保留下来了。现在，弗伦克兹（Ferenczi）把内向投射定义为“投射”的对立概念，即把客体摄入（indrawing）到主体的兴趣范围中去，而“投射”却指把主观内容驱入到客体中。“妄想狂者将他变得讨厌的情绪从他的自我中排除出去，而神经病患者则擅自尽其自我的需要摄取外部世界的某一部分，并把这一部分变成无意识幻想的对象。”前一种机制是投射，后者则是内向投射。内向投射是一种“淡化过程”（diluting process），一种“兴趣范围的扩展”。在弗伦克兹看来，这是一种正常的过程。

Psychologically speaking, introjection is a process of *assimilation* (q.v.), while projection is a process of *dissimilation*. Introjection is an assimilation of object to subject, projection a dissimilation of object from subject through the expulsion of a subjective content into the object (v. *Projection, active)*. Introjection is a process of *extraversion* (q.v.), since assimilation to the object requires *empathy* (q.v.) and an investment of the object with *libido*(q.v.). A *passive* and an *active* introjection may be distinguished: transference phenomena in the treatment of the neuroses belong to the former category, and, in general, all cases where the object exercises a compelling influence on the subject, while empathy as a process of adaptation belongs to the latter category.

从心理学上来说，内向投射是同化的过程，而投射则是异化的过程。内向投射使客体同化与主体，而投射则通过将主观内容驱入客体（参见“投射”条）而使客体异化于主体。内向投射是一种外倾的过程，因为对客体的同化要求移情，要求客体所具有的能量的投入。可以将被动的内向投射与主动的内向投射区分开来：在治疗心理症患者时所出现的移转作用（transference）的现象属于前一范畴，一般来说，所有客体对主体具有一种强有力的影响的情形都属于这一范畴；而作为一种适应过程的移情则属于后一范畴。

## 34. 内倾 (introversion)

INTROVERSION means an inward-turning of *libido*(q.v.), in the sense of a negative relation of subject to object. Interest does not move towards the object but withdraws from it into the subject. Everyone whose attitude is introverted thinks, feels, and acts in a way that clearly demonstrates that the subject is the prime motivating factor and that the object is of secondary importance. Introversion may be intellectual or emotional, just as it can be characterized by *sensation* or *intuition* (qq.v.). It is *active*when the subject *voluntarily* shuts himself off from the object, *passive* when he is unable to restore to the object the libido streaming back from it. When introversion is habitual, we speak of an *introverted type* (q.v.).

内倾意味着欲力的内向-流动，它表现了一种主体对客体的否定性关系。兴趣不是朝向客体运动，而是从客体退回到主体。每一个持内倾态度的人都按照这样的方式思考、感觉和行动，该方式清楚地显示出主体是动机形成的主要因素，而客体仅仅获得了次要的价值。内倾可能是理智的或情绪的，就正像它可能具有感觉或直觉的特征一样。当主体自愿把自己与客体隔离开来时，内倾便是主动的，而当主体无法使从客体流回的欲力再回复到客体时，它就是被动的了。内倾一旦形成习惯，我们则称其为内倾型。

## 35. 直觉 (intuition)

INTUITION (L. *intueri*, ‘to look at or into’). I regard intuition as a basic psychological *function* (q.v.). It is the function that mediates perceptions in an *unconscious way*. Everything, whether outer or inner objects or their relationships, can be the focus of this perception. The peculiarity of intuition is that it is neither sense perception, nor feeling, nor intellectual inference, although it may also appear in these forms. In intuition a content presents itself whole and complete, without our being able to explain or discover how this content came into existence. Intuition is a kind of instinctive apprehension, no matter of what contents. Like *sensation* (q.v.), it is an *irrational* (q.v.) function of perception. As with sensation, its contents have the character of being “given,” in contrast to the “derived” or “produced” character of *thinking* and *feeling* (qq.v.) contents. Intuitive knowledge possesses an intrinsic certainty and conviction, which enabled Spinoza (and Bergson) to uphold the *scientia intuitiva* as the highest form of knowledge. Intuition shares this quality with *sensation* (q.v.), whose certainty rests on its physical foundation. The certainty of intuition rests equally on a definite state of psychic “alertness” of whose origin the subject is unconscious.

根据我的观点，直觉是一种基本的心理功能。它是以一种无意识的方式传达知觉的功能。无论外在对象、内在对象还是它们两者的联系，所有这一切都能成为这种知觉的焦点。直觉具有这样的特殊本质：它既非感官知觉，也非情感，更不是理智的推论，尽管它也可能出现在这些形式的任何一种中。在直觉中，某种内容本身都会作为整体而完全呈现出来，但我们却无法解释或发现这种内容是如何获致的。直觉是一种本能的领悟，而不管其内容是什么。像感觉一样，它是一种非理性的知觉功能。类似于感觉，直觉的内容具有“被给定”的特征，与思维和情感“衍生的”或“产生的”特征形成对照。直觉的知识具有一种内在的确定性和内在的确信性，它们使斯宾诺莎（以及柏格森）将直觉的知识（scientia intuitiva）确认为最高的认识形式。直觉与感觉都具有这种性质，而感觉的确定性建立在身体的基础上。直觉的确定性同样依赖于一种特定的心理“警觉”（alertness）状态，只不过主体并没有意识到这种状态的根源罢了。

Intuition may be *subjective* or *objective:* the first is a perception of unconscious psychic data originating in the subject, the second is a perception of data dependent on subliminal perceptions of the object and on the feelings and thoughts they evoke. We may also distinguish *concrete*and *abstract* forms of intuition, according to the degree of participation on the part of sensation. Concrete intuition mediates perceptions concerned with the actuality of things, abstract intuition mediates perceptions of ideational connections. Concrete intuition is a reactive process, since it responds directly to the given facts; abstract intuition, like abstract sensation, needs a certain element of direction, an act of the will, or an aim.

直觉可能是主观的也可能是客观的：前者是对植根于主体的无意识心理材料的知觉；后者则是对另一些材料的知觉，这些材料依赖于对客体的阈下知觉，依赖于客体所引发的情感与思维。根据感觉参与的程度，我们也可把直觉具体的形式与抽象的形式区分开来。具体的直觉所传达的知觉与事物的具体性相关，而抽象的直觉则传达对于观念性联系的知觉。具体直觉是一种反应的过程，因为它直接对既定的事实作出回应；而抽象的直觉则像抽象的感觉一样，它需要某种定向的因素、需要一种意志的行为或目标。

Like sensation, intuition is a characteristic of infantile and primitive psychology. It counterbalances the powerful sense impressions of the child and the primitive by mediating perceptions of mythological images, the precursors of *ideas* (q.v.). It stands in a compensatory relationship to sensation and, like it, is the matrix out of which thinking and feeling develop as rational functions. Although intuition is an irrational function, many intuitions can afterwards be broken down into their component elements and their origin thus brought into harmony with the laws of reason.

类似于感觉，直觉具有婴儿期心理和原初心理的典型特征。它通过传达对神话意象——即观念的前身——的知觉，在婴儿期的强有力的感官印象与原初心理之间做出平衡。直觉对感觉保持一种补偿的关系，并且像感觉一样，它是思维与情感赖以发展为理性功能的母体。虽然直觉是一种非理性的功能，但是许多直觉事后都可以被分解开来，置放到它们的组成要素和它们的起源中去，因此它们就与理性法则协调一致了。

Everyone whose general *attitude* (q.v.) is oriented by intuition belongs to the intuitive *type* (q.v.). Introverted and extraverted intuitives may be distinguished according to whether intuition is directed inwards, to the inner vision, or outwards, to action and achievement. In abnormal cases intuition is in large measure fused together with the contents of the *collective unconscious* (q.v.) and determined by them, and this may make the intuitive type appear extremely irrational and beyond comprehension.

所有其一般态度定向于直觉的人都属于直觉型（参见“类型”条）。根据直觉是向内定向于内在幻觉还是向外定向于行动和成就，就可以将内倾直觉与外倾直觉区分开来。在反常情况下，直觉在很大程度上与集体无意识的内容相混合，并为其所决定，这使直觉型显得极为非理性，令人困惑不解。

## 36. 非理性 (irrational)

I use this term not as denoting something *contrary* to reason, but something *beyond* reason, something, therefore, not grounded on reason. Elementary facts come into this category; the fact, for example, that the earth has a moon, that chlorine is an element, that water reaches its greatest density at four degrees centigrade, etc. Another irrational fact is *chance*, even though it may be possible to demonstrate a rational causation after the event.

我使用这个词并非指某种与理性相对立的东西，而是指超出理性之外的东西，并非以理性为基础的东西。基本的事实属于这个范畴，例如地球上有月亮，氯是一种元素，水的最大密度在摄氏4度，等等。偶发事件也是非理性的，尽管可能在事件之后证明是符合理性因果律的。

The irrational is an existential factor which, though it may be pushed further and further out of sight by an increasingly elaborate rational explanation, finally makes the explanation so complicated that it passes our powers of comprehension, the limits of rational thought being reached long before the whole of the world could be encompassed by the laws of reason. A completely rational explanation of an object that actually exists (not one that is merely posited) is a Utopian ideal. Only an object that is posited can be completely explained on rational grounds, since it does not contain anything beyond what has been posited by rational thinking. Empirical science, too, posits objects that are confined within rational bounds, because by deliberately excluding the accidental it does not consider the actual object as a whole, but only that part of it which has been singled out for rational observation.

非理性是这样一种存在因素，虽然它可能被日益精致化的理性阐释一步一步地挤压出我们的视线，但它最终使这种阐释变得如此复杂，以致超出了我们的理解的能力，因而在整个世界可能被理性法则所囊括之前，其实理性思维的局限就早已暴露无遗了。要对一个实际存在的客体（并非纯粹假设的客体）作出完全符合理性的解释是一种乌托邦式的理想。只有被假设的客体才能在理性的基础上得到完满的解释，因为它并不具有任何超出被理性思维所设定的东西。经验科学也同样设定了囿限于理性范围内的客体，因为通过对偶发事件的刻意排除，它并不会从整体上来思考实际的客体，而只能思考被挑选出来的适应于理性观察的客体的某一部分。

In this sense *thinking* is a *directed function*, and so is *feeling* (qq.v.). When these functions are concerned not with a rational choice of objects, or with the qualities and interrelations of objects, but with the perception of accidentals which the actual object never lacks, they at once lose the attribute of directedness and, with it, something of their rational character, because they then accept the accidental. They begin to be irrational. The kind of thinking or feeling that is directed to the perception of accidentals, and is therefore irrational, is either *intuitive* or *sensational*. Both *intuition* and *sensation* (qq.v.) are functions that find fulfilment in the *absolute perception* of the flux of events. Hence, by their very nature, they will react to every possible occurrence and be attuned to the absolutely contingent, and must therefore lack all rational direction. For this reason I call them irrational functions, as opposed to thinking and feeling, which find fulfilment only when they are in complete harmony with the laws of reason.

在这个意义上，思维是一种定向的功能，情感也是这样。当这些功能并不涉及到对客体的理性选择，或并不涉及到客体的性质及其相互联系，而只是涉及到对实际客体所并不缺乏的偶发性的知觉时，它们就立刻丧失了它们定向的功用，由此也就丧失了它们的某些理性特征，因为它们接受了偶发性。它们开始成为非理性的了。某种定向于对偶发性事件的知觉的思维或情感——因而它们是非理性的——不是直觉的就是感觉的。直觉和感觉是在对事件之流的绝对知觉中实现其功效的心理功能，所以凭借它们的本性，它们能对每一种可能的偶发事件作出反应，与绝对的偶然性协调一致，因而也必然丧失了所有的理性定向。因此，我称它们为非理性的功能，与思维和情感相对置，因为后者只有在它们完全与理性法则符合一致时才能实现其功效。

Although the irrational as such can never become the object of science, it is of the greatest importance for a practical psychology that the irrational factor should be correctly appraised. Practical psychology stirs up many problems that are not susceptible of a rational solution, but can only be settled irrationally, in a way not in accord with the laws of reason. The expectation or exclusive conviction that there must be a rational way of settling every conflict can be an insurmountable obstacle to finding a solution of an irrational nature.

虽然非理性从不能成为科学的对象，但是对于实用心理学来说，正确评价非理性的因素却是极为重要的。实用心理学提出了许多理性所完全无法解决的问题，而只能由非理性来解决，只能走上一条与理性法则相反的道路。期望或者绝对相信必然存在一种能够解决所有冲突的理性的方法，对于寻求具有非理性性质的解决之道来说，是一个难以逾越的障碍。

## 37. 欲力 (libido)

By libido I mean *psychic energy*. Psychic energy is the *intensity* of a psychic process, its *psychological value*. This does not imply an assignment of value, whether moral, aesthetic, or intellectual; the psychological value is already implicit in its *determining* power, which expresses itself in definite psychic effects. Neither do I understand libido as a psychic *force*, a misconception that has led many critics astray. I do not hypostatize the concept of energy, but use it to denote intensities or values. The question as to whether or not a specific psychic force exists has nothing to do with the concept of libido. I often use “libido” promiscuously with “energy.” The justification for calling psychic energy libido is fully gone into in the works cited in the footnote.

在我看来，欲力意指心理能量。心理能量是心理过程的强度，它的心理价值。这并不是指价值的分配，无论是其道德的价值、审美的价值还是理智的价值；心理价值已经隐含在其决定性的力量中，以特定的心理效用表现出来。我从未把欲力理解为一种心理力（force），而许多批评家正是因为这种误解才步入歧途的。我也没有把能量的概念实体化，而只是用它来表示一种强度或价值。至于是否存在一种特定的心理力这个问题，则与欲力的概念完全无关。我常常不加区别地使用欲力与“能量”的概念。至于我称心理能量为欲力的理由已在本书脚注所引用的著作中充分地解释过了。

## 38. 客观层面 (objective level)

When I speak of interpreting a dream or fantasy on the objective level, I mean that the persons or situations appearing in it are referred to objectively real persons or situations, in contrast to interpretation on the *subjective level* (q.v.), where the persons or situations refer exclusively to subjective factors. Freud’s interpretation of dreams is almost entirely on the objective level, since the dream wishes refer to real objects, or to sexual processes which fall within the physiological, extra-psychological sphere.

当我从客观层面上来论及对梦或幻想的解释时，我的意思是说，出现在梦或幻想中的人或情境可以从客观上归属于现实的人或真实的情境。与之相对的解释可以从主观层面上作出，在那里，人和情境完全被归结为主观的因素。弗洛伊德对梦的解释几乎完全建立在客观层面上，因为梦的愿望可归结为现实的对象，或归结为性的过程，它们都完全落入了生理学的、超心理学的势力范围。

## 39. 定向 (orientation)

I use this term to denote the general principle governing an *attitude* (q.v.). Every attitude is oriented by a certain viewpoint, no matter whether this viewpoint is conscious or not. A power attitude (v. *Power-complex*) is oriented by the power of the *ego* (q.v.) to hold its own against unfavourable influences and conditions. A thinking attitude is oriented by the principle of logic as its supreme law; a sensation attitude is oriented by the sensuous perception of given facts.

这个概念被用来表达支配态度的一般原则。每种态度都定向于某个观点，而无论这个观点是否是意识的。权力态度（参见“权利-情结”条）定向于自我权力，以自身的力量来抵御不利的影响和环境。思维的态度定向于作为其至高律令的逻辑原则；感觉的态度则定向于对既定的事实的感官知觉。

## 40. 神秘参与 (participation mystique)

PARTICIPATION MYSTIQUE is a term derived from Lévy-Bruhl. It denotes a peculiar kind of psychological connection with objects, and consists in the fact that the subject cannot clearly distinguish himself from the object but is bound to it by a direct relationship which amounts to partial *identity* (q.v.). This identity results from an *a priori*oneness of subject and object. *Participation mystique* is a vestige of this primitive condition. It does not apply to the whole subject-object relationship but only to certain cases where this peculiar tie occurs. It is a phenomenon that is best observed among primitives, though it is found very frequently among civilized peoples, if not with the same incidence and intensity. Among civilized peoples it usually occurs between persons, seldom between a person and a thing. In the first case it is a transference relationship, in which the object (as a rule) obtains a sort of magical—i.e. absolute—influence over the subject. In the second case there is a similar influence on the part of the thing, or else an *identification* (q.v.) with a thing or the idea of a thing.

这个概念源于列维-布留尔。它意指某种与客体的特殊的心理联系，在那里，主体不能清楚地把自己同客体区分开来，他通过一种相当于与客体部分同一的直接联系而与客体捆绑在一起。这种同一导源于主客体先天的合一。神秘参与是这种原初状况的残留物。它并不适应于全部的主-客体关系，而仅仅适用于某些在那里出现有这种特殊的关系的情形。在原初人中，这种现象最容易看到，尽管在文明人这里也并不少见，只是其影响范围或强度有所不同罢了。在文明人中它通常发生在人与人之间，而极少发生在人与物之间。在前种状况中，它是所谓的移转作用的关系，其中对象（一般而论）获得了某种作用于主体的魔力般的——即绝对的——影响。在后种情形下，它的影响同样强大，只不过其对象是物罢了，要不然就是一种对物或物的观念的认同作用。

## 41. 人格面具 (persona)：

参见“灵魂”条。

## 42. 权力情结 (power-complex)

POWER-COMPLEX. I occasionally use this term to denote the whole complex of ideas and strivings which seek to subordinate all other influences to the *ego* (q.v.), no matter whether these influences have their source in people and objective conditions or in the subject’s own impulses, thoughts, and feelings.

我偶尔用这个概念来意指观念的整个情结，其全部奋斗都在于使所有其他的影响屈从于自我，而全然没有看到这些影响在民众和客观环境中所具有的根源，也没有看到它们根植于主体自身的冲动、思维和情感。

## 43. 投射 (projection)

PROJECTION means the expulsion of a subjective content into an object; it is the opposite of *introjection*(q.v.). Accordingly it is a process of *dissimilation* (v. *Assimilation*), by which a subjective content becomes alienated from the subject and is, so to speak, embodied in the object. The subject gets rid of painful, incompatible contents by projecting them, as also of positive values which, for one reason or another—self-depreciation, for instance—are inaccessible to him. Projection results from the archaic *identity* (q.v.) of subject and object, but is properly so called only when the need to dissolve the identity with the object has already arisen. This need arises when the identity becomes a disturbing factor, i.e., when the absence of the projected content is a hindrance to adaptation and its withdrawal into the subject has become desirable. From this moment the previous partial identity acquires the character of projection. The term projection therefore signifies a state of identity that has become noticeable, an object of criticism, whether it be the self-criticism of the subject or the objective criticism of another.

投射意味着主观内容驱入客体中；它与内向投射相对。因此，投射是一个异化（参见“同化”条）的过程，在这里，主观内容变得与主体疏离，或者可以说被具体化到客体中去了。主体通过将某些痛苦的不相容的内容投射出去而摆脱了它们，主体也投射那些具有正面价值的内容，由于这种或那种原因——例如自卑——这些内容难以为主体所接受的。投射产生于主体与客体的原初同一（参照该条），但是，只有当解除与客体同一的需求已经出现时，才能恰当地称其为投射。当同一变成一种扰乱的因素，亦即当被投射的内容的欠缺成为适应过程的阻碍，将进入主体的内容撤回成为当务之急时，这种需求就出现了。这时，先前的部分同一获得了投射的特征。因此，投射一词意指一种同一状态，该状态已变得引人注目，成为了一种批判的对象，无论它是主体的自我批评，还是别人的客观批评。

We may distinguish *passive* and *active* projection. The passive form is the customary form of all pathological and many normal projections; they are not intentional and are purely automatic occurrences. The active form is an essential component of the act of *empathy* (q.v.). Taken as a whole, empathy is a process of introjection, since it brings the object into intimate relation with the subject. In order to establish this relationship, the subject detaches a content—a feeling, for instance—from himself, lodges it in the object, thereby animating it, and in this way draws the object into the sphere of the subject. The active form of projection is, however, also an act of judgment, the aim of which is to separate the subject from the object. Here a subjective judgment is detached from the subject as a valid statement and lodged in the object; by this act the subject distinguishes himself from the object. Projection, accordingly, is a process of *introversion* (q.v.) since, unlike introjection, it does not lead to ingestion and assimilation but to differentiation and separation of subject from object. Hence it plays a prominent role in paranoia, which usually ends in the total isolation of the subject.

我们可以区分消极的与积极的投射。前者是所有病态的和许多正常投射的惯常形式；它是无目的的，纯粹自主地出现。后者是移情活动的一种主要构成成分。从总体上看，移情是内向投射的过程，因为它把客体带入与主体的密切联系中。为了建立这种联系，主体把某种内容——例如一种情感——从他自身分离出去；投入客体中，由此而使客体变得生气勃勃，以这种方式将客体吸入主体的范围。然而，投射的积极形式也是一种判断的行为，其目的在于将主体与客体分离开来。在这里，主观判断作为一种有效陈述从主体中分离出来，移入客体之中；由此，主体把自己与客体区分开来了。因此，投射是一种内倾过程，因为不同于内向投射，它并没有走向摄取和同化，而是走向了主体与客体的区分和分离。因而它在偏执妄想狂患者身上扮演了最主要的角色，通常以主体彻底的孤立而告终。

### 43a.心灵 (psyche)

参见“灵魂”条

## 44. 理性的 (rational)

The rational is the reasonable, that which accords with reason. I conceive reason as an *attitude* (q.v.) whose principle it is to conform thought, feeling, and action to objective values. Objective values are established by the everyday experience of external facts on the one hand, and of inner, psychological facts on the other. Such experiences, however, could not represent objective “values” if they were “valued” as such by the subject, for that would already amount to an act of reason. The rational attitude which permits us to declare objective values as valid at all is not the work of the individual subject, but the product of human history.

理性的就是符合情理的，即与理性相一致。我把理性理解为一种态度，其原则在于使思维、情感和行为与客观价值相符合。客观价值一方面建立在外在事实日常经验的基础上，另一方面则建基于内在心理事实的日常经验。然而，如果这些经验是主体“评价”为有价值的，那么它们并不能代表客观的“价值”，因为这已经是一种理性的活动了。使我们有权力宣称客观价值具有最终的有效性的理性态度并不是单个主体的创造，而是整个人类历史的产物。

Most objective values—and reason itself—are firmly established complexes of ideas handed down through the ages. Countless generations have laboured at their organization with the same necessity with which the living organism reacts to the average, constantly recurring environmental conditions, confronting them with corresponding functional complexes, as the eye, for instance, perfectly corresponds to the nature of light. One might, therefore, speak of a pre-existent, metaphysical, universal “Reason” were it not that the adapted reaction of the living organism to average environmental influences is the necessary condition of its existence—a thought already expressed by Schopenhauer. Human reason, accordingly, is nothing other than the expression of man’s adaptability to average occurrences, which have gradually become deposited in firmly established complexes of ideas that constitute our objective values. Thus the laws of reason are the laws that designate and govern the average, “correct,” adapted *attitude* (q.v.). Everything is “rational” that accords with these laws, everything that contravenes them is “irrational” (q.v.).

大多数客观价值——以及理性本身——乃是历代传承下来的根基稳固的观念集丛。无数代人辛勤劳作所努力组织起来的这些观念集丛，其必要性正与以下情形相一致：生命机体必须对环境中所通常不断发生的状况作出反应，用相应的功能情结来面对这些状况，例如像眼睛，它是如此完美地与光的性质相对应。如果生命机体适应于一般环境影响的反应不是它赖以存在的必要条件的话——这是叔本华所已经表达的观点，那么我们就可以因此而谈论所谓先天存在的、形而上学的、普遍性的“理性”了。由此可见，人类理性并非别的什么，不过是人对一般环境的适应所作的表达，它逐渐积淀于稳固建立起来的观念集丛中，构成我们的客观价值。所以，理性律是这样的规律，它指称并统辖那些普遍认为“正确的”的东西，即已经适应的态度。一切与这些规律相符合的便是“理性的”，一切与此相冲突的便是非理性的。

*Thinking* and *feeling* (qq.v.) are rational functions in so far as they are decisively influenced by *reflection*. They function most perfectly when they are in the fullest possible accord with the laws of reason. The irrational functions, *sensation* and *intuition* (qq.v.), are those whose aim is pure *perception*; for, as far as possible, they are forced to dispense with the rational (which presupposes the exclusion of everything that is outside reason) in order to attain the most complete perception of the general flux of events.

思维与情感是理性功能，因为它们受到反思的决定性影响。当它们极尽可能地与理性律相符合时，它们运作得最完美。而感觉和直觉则是非理性的功能，它们的目的是纯粹的知觉；为了获得对整个事件过程最完美的知觉，它们不得不尽可能地排除理性（因为理性以排除超出理智之外的一切为先决条件）。

## 45. 还原 (reductive)

REDUCTIVE means “leading back.” I use this term to denote a method of psychological interpretation which regards the unconscious product not as a *symbol* (q.v.) but *semiotically*, as a *sign* or *symptom* of an underlying process. Accordingly, the reductive method traces the unconscious product back to its elements, no matter whether these be reminiscences of events that actually took place, or elementary psychic processes. The reductive method is oriented backwards, in contrast to the *constructive* (q.v.) method, whether in the purely historical sense or in the figurative sense of tracing complex, differentiated factors back to something more general and more elementary. The interpretive methods of both Freud and Adler are reductive, since in both cases there is a reduction to the elementary processes of wishing or striving, which in the last resort are of an infantile or physiological nature. Hence the unconscious product necessarily acquires the character of an inauthentic expression to which the term “symbol” is not properly applicable. Reduction has a disintegrative effect on the real significance of the unconscious product, since this is either traced back to its historical antecedents and thereby annihilated, or integrated once again with the same elementary process from which it arose.

还原意指“返回”，我用这个术语表示这样一种心理解释的方法，即不是把无意识的产品看作一种象征，而是从症状学上将之视为一种潜在过程的符号或征兆。因此，还原的方法是将无意识的产品回溯到其元素，无论它们是对实际发生的事件的回忆，还是一些基本的心理过程。还原的方法是向后定向的，与建构的方法恰成对照，无论在纯粹历史的意义上还是在比喻的意义上，都在于将复杂的、已经分化的因素回溯到某种更普遍和更基本的东西上去。弗洛伊德和阿德勒的方法都是还原的，因为在他们两者中都存在一种对愿望或追求的基本过程的还原，最终，这些愿望和追求都具有婴儿期的或生理性质的特征。因此，无意识产品必然被认为具有一种非确切的表达方式的特征，而“象征”一词也不真正适合表达这一特征。还原法对无意识产品的真正含义有着拆解的作用，因为它不是追溯到其历史的前在物，从而使其意义荡然无存，就是根据其从此所生的同样的基本过程将它们重新组合起来。

## 46. 自身 (self)

As an empirical concept, the self designates the whole range of psychic phenomena in man. It expresses the unity of the personality as a whole. But in so far as the total personality, on account of its unconscious component, can be only in part conscious, the concept of the self is, in part, only *potentially* empirical and is to that extent a *postulate*. In other words, it encompasses both the experienceable and the inexperienceable (or the not yet experienced). It has these qualities in common with very many scientific concepts that are more names than ideas. In so far as psychic totality, consisting of both conscious and unconscious contents, is a postulate, it is a *transcendental*concept, for it presupposes the existence of unconscious factors on empirical grounds and thus characterizes an entity that can be described only in part but, for the other part, remains at present unknowable and illimitable.

作为一个经验的概念，自身意指“一个人心理现象的全部范围”。它表达了作为整体的人格的统一性。但是，就整体人格由于其无意识的组成成分它只能部分地是意识的而言，自身的概念也仅仅部分地可能是经验的，而其他方面却是预设的。换句话来说，它包涵可以经验到的和无法经验到的（或仍然未经验到的）。它所具有的这些性质是众多的科学概念所普遍具有的，它们的命名远比观念之类概念流行。就由意识和无意识所构成的心理整体是一种预设而言，它即是一个超验的概念，因为它预设了经验基础之上的无意识因素的存在，因而具有统一体的特征，它只能得到部分地描述，而其他的部分仍然呈现出未知的、不可计量的特点。

Just as conscious as well as unconscious phenomena are to be met with in practice, the self as psychic totality also has a conscious as well as an unconscious aspect. Empirically, the self appears in dreams, myths, and fairytales in the figure of the “supraordinate personality” (v. EGO), such as a king, hero, prophet, saviour, etc., or in the form of a totality symbol, such as the circle, square, *quadratura circuli*, cross, etc. When it represents a *complexio oppositorum*, a union of opposites, it can also appear as a united duality, in the form, for instance, of *tao* as the interplay of *yang* and *yin*, or of the hostile brothers, or of the hero and his adversary (arch-enemy, dragon), Faust and Mephistopheles, etc. Empirically, therefore, the self appears as a play of light and shadow, although conceived as a totality and unity in which the opposites are united. Since such a concept is irrepresentable—*tertium non datur*—it is transcendental on this account also. It would, logically considered, be a vain speculation were it not for the fact that it designates symbols of unity that are found to occur empirically.

正像在实践中我们总是遇到意识现象和无意识现象一样，作为心理整体的自身也具有意识方面与无意识方面。从经验上来看，自身以诸如国王、英雄、先知、拯救者等“超常人格”（见“自我”条）的形象出现在梦、神话和民间故事中，也以诸如圆环、方形物、方形圆（quadratura circuli）、十字等整体象征的形式出现。当它体现了一种复杂的对立（complexio oppositorum）和一种对立的统一时，它也能显现为二元对立的统一，出现在诸如阳与阴相互作用的道、敌对的兄弟、英雄与他的对手（主要敌人、龙）、浮士德与靡菲斯特等形式中。因此在经验上，自身表现为明与暗的交替，尽管是作为对立双方统一于其中的整体和统一体来领会的。既然这样一个概念是难以表现的——无事实根据的第三者（tertium non datur），那么，它也因此而是超验的。从逻辑思考上来看，它或许是一种空虚的沉思，倘若看不到它意味着统一的象征——通常从经验上才能看到——这一事实的话。

The self is not a philosophical idea, since it does not predicate its own existence, i.e., does not hypostatize itself. From the intellectual point of view it is only a working hypothesis. Its empirical symbols, on the other hand, very often possess a distinct *numinosity*, i.e., an *a priori* emotional value, as in the case of the mandala, “Deus est circulus …,” the Pythagorean tetraktys, the quaternity, etc. It thus proves to be an *archetypal idea* (v. *Idea; Image*), which differs from other ideas of the kind in that it occupies a central position befitting the significance of its content and its numinosity.

自身并不是一个哲学观念，因为它无法论证其自身的存在，即无法使自身实体化。从理性的观点来看，它只是一个正在运作的假设。另一方面，它经验性的象征通常具有明显的超自然性，即一种先天的情绪价值，如在曼陀罗中那样，“神是一个圆环……”还有毕达哥拉斯的四轮花（tetraktys）以及四位一体，等等。因此它被证明是一个原型观念（参见“观念”“意象”条），以某种形式明显与其他观念相区别，在此形式中，它占据了与其内容和超自然的意义相适应的核心位置。

## 47. 感觉 (sensation)

I regard sensation as one of the basic psychological *functions* (q.v.). Wundt likewise reckons it among the elementary psychic phenomena. Sensation is the psychological function that mediates the perception of a physical stimulus. It is, therefore, identical with perception. Sensation must be strictly distinguished from *feeling* (q.v.), since the latter is an entirely different process, although it may associate itself with sensation as “feeling-tone.” Sensation is related not only to external stimuli but to inner ones, i.e., to changes in the internal organic processes.

根据我的观点，感觉是基本心理功能之一，冯特也把感觉视为基本的心理现象。感觉是把对身体的刺激传达于知觉的心理功能。因此它与知觉相等同。必须把感觉与情感（feeling）严格区分开来，因为后者是一种完全不同的过程，尽管它可能作为“情感-色调”与感觉相联系。感觉不仅与外部刺激有关，而且也与内部刺激有关，即与内在器官感受过程中的变化有关。

Primarily, therefore, sensation is *sense perception*—perception mediated by the sense organs and “body-senses” (kinaesthetic, vasomotor sensation, etc.). It is, on the one hand, an element of ideation, since it conveys to the mind the perceptual image of the external object; and on the other hand, it is an element of feeling, since through the perception of bodily changes it gives feeling the character of an *affect* (q.v.). Because sensation conveys bodily changes to consciousness, it is also a representative of physiological impulses. It is not identical with them, being merely a perceptive function.

因此，感觉主要是感官的知觉——知觉通过感觉器官和“体感”（（body-senses），如肌肉运动知觉（kinaesthetic），血管舒缩感（vasomotor sensation），等等）来传达。一方面，它是观念作用的一个要素，因为它把知觉到的外在客体的意象传达给心灵；另一方面，它是一种情感的要素，因为通过对身体变化的知觉，它把感情（affect，参见该条）的特征赋予情感。由于感觉把身体变化传达给意识，它也表现了生理上的冲动。但它并不等同于生理冲动，仅仅只是一种知觉的功能。

A distinction must be made between sensuous or *concrete* (q.v.) sensation and *abstract* (q.v.) sensation. The first includes all the above-mentioned forms of sensation, whereas the second is a sensation that is abstracted or separated from the other psychic elements. Concrete sensation never appears in “pure” form, but is always mixed up with ideas, feelings, thoughts. Abstract sensation is a differentiated kind of perception, which might be termed “aesthetic” in so far as, obeying its own principle, it detaches itself from all contamination with the different elements in the perceived object and from all admixtures of thought and feeling, and thus attains a degree of purity beyond the reach of concrete sensation. The concrete sensation of a flower, on the other hand, conveys a perception not only of the flower as such, but also of the stem, leaves, habitat, and so on. It is also instantly mingled with feelings of pleasure or dislike which the sight of the flower evokes, or with simultaneous olfactory perceptions, or with thoughts about its botanical classification, etc. But abstract sensation immediately picks out the most salient sensuous attribute of the flower, its brilliant redness, for instance, and makes this the sole or at least the principal content of consciousness, entirely detached from all other admixtures. Abstract sensation is found chiefly among artists. Like every abstraction, it is a product of functional *differentiation* (q.v.), and there is nothing primitive about it. The primitive form of a function is always concrete, i.e., contaminated (v. *Archaism; Concretism*). Concrete sensation is a reactive phenomenon, while abstract sensation, like every abstraction, is always associated with the *will* (q.v.), i.e., with a sense of direction. The will that is directed to abstract sensation is an expression and application of the *aesthetic sensation attitude*.

必须将感官上的或具体的感觉与抽象的感觉区分开来。前者包括所有以上提到的感觉的形式，而后者则指一种从其他心理因素中抽象出来的或分离出来的感觉。具体感觉从不能以“纯粹的”形式出现，而总是与观念、情感和思维混合在一起。抽象的感觉是某种已经分化出来的知觉方式，就其按照它自己的原则，使自己从所有与被知觉到的客体的不同要素的混合中分离出来，从所有思维和情感的混合中分离出来，从而达到超出于具体感觉的某种纯粹程度而言，它可以称之为“审美的”。例如，对一朵花的具体感觉不仅传达了对花本身的知觉，而且传达了关于花的茎、叶、产地等的知觉。它也直接混合着看见花时所激起的喜爱或厌恶的情感，同时混合着关于花的气味知觉，以及所引起的花的生物学分类的想法，等等。但是，抽象感觉却直接挑选出花的最为突出的感官属性——例如它光彩夺目的红色——使其成为唯一的或至少是主要的意识内容，完全与所有其他的混合因素分离开来了。抽象感觉主要存在于艺术家中。像所有的抽象作用一样，它是功能分化的产物，并不存在任何原初的东西。功能的原初形式总是具体的，即相互混合的（参见“古代式”与“具体化”两条）。具体的感觉是一种反应的现象，而抽象的感觉则像所有的抽象作用一样，总是与意志，即一种定向感相联系。定向于抽象感觉的意志乃是审美感觉态度的表现及运用。

Sensation is strongly developed in children and primitives, since in both cases it predominates over thinking and feeling, though not necessarily over *intuition* (q.v.). I regard sensation as conscious, and intuition as unconscious, perception. For me sensation and intuition represent a pair of opposites, or two mutually compensating functions, like thinking and feeling. Thinking and feeling as independent functions are developed, both ontogenetically and phylogenetically, from sensation (and equally, of course, from intuition as the necessary counterpart of sensation). A person whose-whole *attitude* (q.v.) is oriented by sensation belongs to the *sensation type* (q.v.).

感觉在儿童和原初人那里获得了极有力的发展，因为他们都是感觉胜于思维和情感的，虽然并不一定会胜过直觉。我把感觉看作有意识的知觉，把直觉看作无意识的知觉。在我看来，感觉与直觉表现着对立的两方面，或两种互相补偿的功能，就像思维与情感一样。思维与情感作为独立的功能，从个体发生和种系发生上来看，都是从感觉发展而来的（当然，也同样地从作为感觉的必然对应物的直觉发展而来）。一个其全部态度定向于感觉的人属于感觉型。

Since sensation is an elementary phenomenon, it is given *a priori*, and, unlike thinking and feeling, is not subject to rational laws. I therefore call it an *irrational* (q.v.) function, although reason contrives to assimilate a great many sensations into a rational context. Normal sensations are proportionate, i.e., they correspond approximately to the intensity of the physical stimulus. Pathological sensations are disproportionate, i.e., either abnormally weak or abnormally strong. In the former case they are inhibited, in the latter exaggerated. The inhibition is due to the predominance of another function; the exaggeration is the result of an abnormal fusion with another function, for instance with undifferentiated thinking or feeling. It ceases as soon as the function with which sensation is fused is differentiated in its own right. The psychology of the neuroses affords instructive examples of this, since we often find a strong *sexualization*(Freud) of other functions, i.e., their fusion with sexual sensations.

既然感觉是一种基本现象，那么它就是先天给定的，不同于思维和情感，它并不服从于理性规律。因此我称其为非理性（参照该条）的功能，尽管理性努力把大部分感觉同化于理性系统中。正常的感觉是均衡的，即它们大致与身体刺激的强度相对应。病态的感觉则丧失了均衡，不是反常的微弱就是反常的强大。在前种状况中，它们受到抑制，在后种状况中，它们则被夸大。抑制是因为另一功能占据优势地位；夸大则是因为与其他功能不正常地相混合的结果，例如与未分化的思维或情感的混合。只要那种与感觉相混合的功能按照自己的要求得到了分化，感觉的夸大就中止了。心理症心理学（The Psychology of the neuroses）提供了一些这方面极具启发性的例证，因为我们常常发现一种强烈的对其他功能的性欲化（sexualization，弗洛伊德语），也就是这些功能与性的感觉混合在一起。

## 48. 灵魂 (soul)

I have been compelled, in my investigations into the structure of the unconscious, to make a conceptual distinction between *soul* and *psyche*. By psyche I understand the totality of all psychic processes, conscious as well as unconscious. By soul, on the other hand, I understand a clearly demarcated functional complex that can best be described as a “personality.” In order to make clear what I mean by this, I must introduce some further points of view. It is, in particular, the phenomena of somnambulism, double consciousness, split personality, etc., whose investigation we owe primarily to the French school, that have enabled us to accept the possibility of a plurality of personalities in one and the same individual.

在我对无意识结构的研究中，我不得不对灵魂（soul, personality, persona, anima）与心理（psyche）两者作出概念上的区分。我把心理理解为所有心理过程、意识和无意识的总和。而把灵魂理解为一种能被恰当地描述为“人格”的得到明确界定的功能集丛。为了更清楚地表达我的意思，我必须引进某些更确切的观点，尤其是梦游症、双重意识（double consciousness）和人格分裂等现象，对这些现象的研究应主要归功于法国学派，这些研究使我们认识到在同一个体中存在多重人格的可能性。

*Soul as a functional complex or “personality”*<br/>作为功能情绪或“人格”的灵魂

It is at once evident that such a plurality of personalities can never appear in a normal individual. But, as the above-mentioned phenomena show, the possibility of a dissociation of personality must exist, at least in the germ, within the range of the normal. And, as a matter of fact, any moderately acute psychological observer will be able to demonstrate, without much difficulty, traces of character-splitting in normal individuals. One has only to observe a man rather closely, under varying conditions, to see that a change from one milieu to another brings about a striking alteration of personality, and on each occasion a clearly defined character emerges that is noticeably different from the previous one. “Angel abroad, devil at home” is a formulation of the phenomenon of character-splitting derived from everyday experience. A particular milieu necessitates a particular *attitude* (q.v.). The longer this attitude lasts, and the more often it is required, the more habitual it becomes. Very many people from the educated classes have to move in two totally different milieus—the domestic circle and the world of affairs. These two totally different environments demand two totally different attitudes, which, depending on the degree of the ego’s *identification* (q.v.) with the attitude of the moment, produce a duplication of character. In accordance with social conditions and requirements, the social character is oriented on the one hand by the expectations and demands of society, and on the other by the social aims and aspirations of the individual. The domestic character is, as a rule, moulded by emotional demands and an easy-going acquiescence for the sake of comfort and convenience; whence it frequently happens that men who in public life are extremely energetic, spirited, obstinate, wilful and ruthless appear good-natured, mild, compliant, even weak, when at home and in the bosom of the family. Which is the true character, the real personality? This question is often impossible to answer.

很显然，这种多重人格从不可能出现在正常个体中。但是，像以上提及的现象所表明的，人格分裂的可能性是必然存在的，至少潜藏在正常个体中。事实上，任何稍微细心的心理观察者就可不太困难地证明，正常个体中具有性格分裂的痕迹。我们只要非常仔细地在不同的环境中观察某人，就会发现从一种环境到另一种环境的变化对他的人格所产生的明显变异，在每一种场合都会浮现出一种与先前场合截然不同的且轮廓鲜明的性格。“在外面是天使而在家里是魔鬼”这句谚语正是来自日常经验的对人格分裂现象的概括表现。特定的环境要求特定的态度。这种态度持续的时间越长，越需要频繁地出现，它就越是成为习惯性的态度。有教养阶层的大多数人都不得不活动于两种完全不同的环境——家庭的圈子与事业的世界。这两种截然不同的环境要求两种截然不同的态度，根据自我与当时态度的认同作用所达到的程度，产生出性格的双重性。由于社会的限制和要求，社会性格一方面定向于社会的期待和社会的需要，另一方面定向于个人的社会目标和抱负。通常，因为便利和舒适的缘故，家庭性格为感情的需要和闲散的追求所铸造；而在公共场合活动的人则完全是精力充沛的、大胆的、顽强的、意志坚定的，当那些铁石心肠的人在家中处于天伦之乐的气氛中时，就变得脾气温和、随和甚至软弱。那么，他们真实的性格究竟是哪一种？其真正的人格又是什么？这个问题常常是难以回答的。

These reflections show that even in normal individuals character-splitting is by no means an impossiblity. We are, therefore, fully justified in treating personality dissociation as a problem of normal psychology. In my view the answer to the above question should be that such a man has no real character at all: he is not *individual* (q.v.) but *collective*(q.v.), the plaything of circumstance and general expectations. Were he individual, he would have the same character despite the variation of attitude. He would not be identical with the attitude of the moment, and he neither would nor could prevent his *individuality* (q.v.) from expressing itself just as clearly in one state as in another. Naturally he is individual, like every living being, but unconsciously so. Because of his more or less complete identification with the attitude of the moment, he deceives others, and often himself, as to his real character. He puts on a *mask*, which he knows is in keeping with his conscious intentions, while it also meets the requirements and fits the opinions of society, first one motive and then the other gaining the upper hand.

这些思考表明，即使在正常个体中，性格-分裂绝不是没有可能的。因此，我们完全有理由将人格分裂视为一个正常心理学的问题。在我看来，以上问题的答案在于，这种人并不具有真正的性格：他并非个体的，而是属于集体性的，不过成为环境和普遍期望的玩物罢了。如果他是个体的，他就只会有同一种性格，而不管其态度怎样变化。他绝不会与当下的态度苟同，既不会也不可能阻碍他在种种不同的状况中将自己的个性表达出来。自然，像所有生命物的存在一样，他是个体的，但这只是一种无意识的存在。由于他或多或少地与当下态度处于同一中，他对他人隐藏了他的真实性格甚至欺骗了自己。他戴上了一个面具，并且知道这个面具与他的意识意图保持一致，同时，该面具也与社会的要求相契合，顺应了社会的舆论，使他的动机一个接一个地获得成功。

*Soul as persona*<br/>作为人格面具的灵魂

This mask, i.e., the *ad hoc* adopted attitude, I have called the *persona*, which was the name for the masks worn by actors in antiquity. The man who identifies with this mask I would call “personal” as opposed to “individual.”

这个面具，即这种特别（ad hoc）采纳的态度，我称为人格面具（persona），这一指称源自古代演员所戴的面具。与这种面具相一致的人我称为“人格的”，与“个体的”相对。

The two above-mentioned attitudes represent two collective personalities, which may be summed up quite simply under the name “personae.” I have already suggested that the real individuality is different from both. The persona is thus a functional complex that comes into existence for reasons of adaptation or personal convenience, but is by no means identical with the individuality. The persona is exclusively concerned with the relation to objects. The relation of the individual to the object must be sharply distinguished from the relation to the subject. By the “subject” I mean first of all those vague, dim stirrings, feelings, thoughts, and sensations which flow in on us not from any demonstrable continuity of conscious experience of the object, but well up like a disturbing, inhibiting, or at times helpful, influence from the dark inner depths, from the background and underground vaults of consciousness, and constitute, in their totality, our perception of the life of the unconscious. The subject, conceived as the “inner object,” *is* the unconscious. Just as there is a relation to the outer object, an outer attitude, there is a relation to the inner object, an inner attitude. It is readily understandable that this inner attitude, by reason of its extremely intimate and inaccessible nature, is far more difficult to discern than the outer attitude, which is immediately perceived by everyone. Nevertheless, it does not seem to me impossible to formulate it as a concept. All those allegedly accidental inhibitions, fancies, moods, vague feelings, and scraps of fantasy that hinder concentration and disturb the peace of mind even of the most normal man, and that are rationalized away as being due to bodily causes and suchlike, usually have their origin, not in the reasons consciously ascribed to them, but in perceptions of unconscious processes. Dreams naturally belong to this class of phenomena, and, as we all know, are often traced back to such external and superficial causes as indigestion, sleeping on one’s back, and so forth, in spite of the fact that these explanations can never stand up to searching criticism. The attitude of the individual in these matters is extremely varied. One man will not allow himself to be disturbed in the slightest by his inner processes—he can ignore them completely; another man is just as completely at their mercy—as soon as he wakes up some fantasy or other, or a disagreeable feeling, spoils his mood for the whole day; a vaguely unpleasant sensation puts the idea into his head that he is suffering from a secret disease, a dream fills him with gloomy forebodings, although ordinarily he is not superstitious. Others, again, have only periodic access to these unconscious stirrings, or only to a certain category of them. For one man they may never have reached consciousness at all as anything worth thinking about, for another they are a worrying problem he broods on daily. One man takes them as physiological, another attributes them to the behaviour of his neighbours, another finds in them a religious revelation.

上面提及的两种态度体现了两种集体人格，它们能被简要地概括为“人格面具”。我已经暗示，真正的个性与这两种人格截然不同。因此，人格面具是由于适应或个人便利的原因而存在的一种功能情结，它绝不与个性相等同。人格面具唯独涉及与客体的关系。必须把个体与外在客体的关系同其与主体的关系截然区分开来。所谓“主体”，我意指所有那些在我们内在之中流动着的模糊而幽暗的心绪搏动、情感、思维与感觉，它们并非源自任何可被证明的对客体的意识性经验，而是像一股骚乱的、令人感到压抑的，或有时又是有益的力量，从黑暗的内心深处，从意识的背后和底层迸涌出来，正是这些东西的总和，构成我们对无意识生命的知觉。被我理解为“内在客体”的主体即是无意识。正如存在一种对于外在客体的关系，即一种外在的态度一样，也存在着一种对于内在客体的关系，即一种内在的态度。十分明显，由于其极为私密而又难以接近的原因，这种内在态度远比外在态度难以辨识，因为外在态度通常立刻能被每一个人知觉到。但是，在我看来，要系统地阐释内在态度的概念似乎并非没有可能。所有这些称为偶然的抑制、奇想、情绪、模糊的情感和支离破碎的幻想之类的东西，在不时地骚扰与扰乱我们的注意力和心灵的平静，即使最正常的人也是如此，它们被合理地解释为属于身体上的或诸如此类的原因，通常，它们的起源并非理性所有意识地描述的那些原因，而是源于对无意识过程的知觉。梦自然可归于这些现象之中，像我们所知道的，梦往往被追溯到诸如消化不良、仰卧等外在的和表面的原因，尽管这些解释事实上从来就经不起深入的批评。在这些情形下，个体的态度绝对是多种多样的。某人或许不会允许自己极轻微地被内在的过程所干扰——他可能完全不去理睬它们；而另一个人却恰恰完全听从它们的摆布——一旦当他苏醒过来，某种幻想或令人讨厌的情感就会破坏他整天的情绪；他头脑中会满是模糊的不愉快的感觉，使他想起某种隐秘的病痛，一个梦会使他充满阴郁的预感，尽管他平时并不迷信。再就其他人而言，他们只是短暂地受到这些无意识的骚扰，或者仅仅短暂地接触到无意识的某些方面。对某人来说，它们从来就没有作为任何值得思考的东西在意识中出现过；而对另一个人来说，它们却是令他整日郁闷困惑的原因。某人将它们视为生理性的，另一个人则把它们归于他邻居的行为；第三个人则在其中找到了宗教的启示。

These entirely different ways of dealing with the stirrings of the unconscious are just as habitual as the attitudes to the outer object. The inner attitude, therefore, is correlated with just as definite a functional complex as the outer attitude. People who, it would seem, entirely overlook their inner psychic processes no more lack a typical inner attitude than the people who constantly overlook the outer object and the reality of facts lack a typical outer one. In all the latter cases, which are by no means uncommon, the persona is characterized by a lack of relatedness, at times even a blind inconsiderateness, that yields only to the harshest blows of fate. Not infrequently, it is just these people with a rigid persona who possess an attitude to the unconscious processes which is extremely susceptible and open to influence. Inwardly they are as weak, malleable, and “soft-centered” as they are inflexible and unapproachable outwardly. Their inner attitude, therefore, corresponds to a personality that is diametrically opposed to the outer personality. I know a man, for instance, who blindly and pitilessly destroyed the happiness of those nearest to him, and yet would interrupt important business journeys just to enjoy the beauty of a forest scene glimpsed from the carriage window. Cases of this kind are doubtless familiar to everyone, so I need not give further examples.

这些对待无意识骚扰的截然不同的方式就正像对待外在对象的态度一样成为了习惯。因此，内在的态度正如外在的态度一样，恰与某种特定的功能情结相关联。似乎可以说，那些完全忽视他们的内在心理过程的人并不缺少一种典型的内在态度，就正像那些一直忽视外在对象和事件现实性的人并不缺少一种典型的外在态度一样。在所有后者的情形中——这绝对地是普遍性的——人格面具具有与外在世界缺少联系的特征，有时甚至对此熟视无睹，仅仅在命运无情的打击下才会有所眷顾。往往正是这些有着严厉的人格面具的人，在态度上极其容易受无意识过程的感染和影响。尽管他们外表上是坚定的和难以接近的，但是只要一触及到他们的内心世界，就可以知道他们是软弱的和缺乏定见的。因此，他们的内在态度正与一种人格相应，而这一人格却与其外在人格截然对立。例如，我认识一个人，他盲目地毫不留情地毁灭了他最亲近的人的所有幸福，他只要欣赏到车窗外所瞥见的森林美景就会立刻中断重要的商务旅程。这类事例无疑为每个人所熟悉，我就无须再举更多的例子了。

*Soul as anima*<br/>作为阿尼玛（anima）的灵魂

We can, therefore, speak of an inner personality with as much justification as, on the grounds of daily experience, we speak of an outer personality. The inner personality is the way one behaves in relation to one’s inner psychic processes; it is the inner attitude, the characteristic face, that is turned towards the unconscious. I call the outer attitude, the outward face, the *persona*; the inner attitude, the inward face, I call the *anima*. To the degree that an attitude is habitual, it is a well-knit functional complex with which the ego can identify itself more or less. Common speech expresses this very graphically: when a man has an habitual attitude to certain situations, an habitual way of doing things, we say he is quite *another man* when doing this or that. This is a practical demonstration of the autonomy of the functional complex represented by the habitual attitude: it is as though another personality had taken possession of the individual, as though “another spirit had got into him.” The same autonomy that very often characterizes the outer attitude is also claimed by the inner attitude, the anima. It is one of the most difficult educational feats to change the persona, the outer attitude, and it is just as difficult to change the anima, since its structure is usually quite as well-knit as the persona’s. Just as the persona is an entity that often seems to constitute the whole character of a man, and may even accompany him unaltered throughout his entire life, the anima is a clearly defined entity with a character that, very often, is autonomous and immutable. It therefore lends itself very readily to characterization and description.

因此，我们完全有理由来讨论一种内在的人格，就正像我们根据日常经验可以合理地讨论一种外在的人格一样。内在人格是与某人的内在心理过程相联系的行为方式；它是转向无意识的内在态度或性格面貌。我称外在的态度或外在面貌为人格面具，而将内在的态度或内在面貌称为阿尼玛。1一种态度一旦达到成为习惯的程度，它便与功能情结牢固地连接在一起，自我就可能或多或少地与这种功能情结相等同了。日常语言对此做了生动的表达：当一个人对某些情境具有一种习惯性的态度，具有一种习惯性的处事方式时，当他这样或那样去做时，我们会说他完全成了另一个人。这是习惯性态度所体现的功能情结自主性的实际证明：就好像另一人格占有了这个个体，好像“另一种精神注进了他的血液”。经常被认为只有外在的态度才具有的自主性也同样为内在态度或阿尼玛（灵魂）所具有。教育事业最困难的任务之一就是改变外在态度或人格面具，而要改变阿尼玛（灵魂）与改变人格面具一样地困难，因为它的结构也像人格面具的结构一样焊接得十分紧密。正如人格面具似乎常常是构成一个人全部性格的统一体，甚至作为他终生无法改变的伴随物一样，阿尼玛（灵魂）也同样是一个带有他全部性格的明晰确定的统一体，通常是自主的和无法改变的。因此它非常易于得到刻画和描述。

As to the character of the anima, my experience confirms the rule that it is, by and large, *complementary* to the character of the persona. The anima usually contains all those common human qualities which the conscious attitude lacks. The tyrant tormented by bad dreams, gloomy forebodings, and inner fears is a typical figure. Outwardly ruthless, harsh, and unapproachable, he jumps inwardly at every shadow, is at the mercy of every mood, as though he were the feeblest and most impressionable of men. Thus his anima contains all those fallible human qualities his persona lacks. If the persona is intellectual, the anima will quite certainly be sentimental. The complementary character of the anima also affects the sexual character, as I have proved to myself beyond a doubt. A very feminine woman has a masculine soul, and a very masculine man has a feminine soul. This contrast is due to the fact that a man is not in all things wholly masculine, but also has certain feminine traits. The more masculine his outer attitude is, the more his feminine traits are obliterated: instead, they appear in his unconscious. This explains why it is just those very virile men who are most subject to characteristic weaknesses; their attitude to the unconscious has a womanish weakness and impressionability. Conversely, it is often just the most feminine women who, in their inner lives, display an intractability, an obstinacy, and a wilfulness that are to be found with comparable intensity only in a man’s outer attitude. These are masculine traits which, excluded from the womanly outer attitude, have become qualities of her soul.

关于阿尼玛（灵魂）的特征，我的经验证实了一种规律的存在，它与人格面具的特征基本上是互补性的。阿尼玛（灵魂）总是包含意识态度所缺乏的人性共有的品质。为恶梦、阴暗的预感和内心的恐怖所折磨的暴君便是典型的例子。他外表冷酷、苛刻和不可接近，但其内心深处，他捕风捉影疑神疑鬼，完全被一些幻觉所摆布，就好像一个耳根最软又最容易被左右的人一样。这样，他的阿尼玛（灵魂）就包含了所有那些他的人格面具所缺失的易受暗示影响的人的品质。倘若其人格面具是理性的，那么其阿尼玛（灵魂）就相当确定地是感情用事的。阿尼玛的这种互补特征也影响到其性别特征，我已毋庸置疑地证明了这一点。一个娇滴滴的女人却有一个男子气的灵魂，一个英俊的男人反倒有一个女子气的内心。这种矛盾可归于这样的事实，一个男人并非全部气质都是男性化的，而是也具有某种女性特征。他的外在态度越男性化，他的女性特征就越容易被涂抹掉；取而代之的是，它们只能出现在他的无意识中了。这就能说明为什么那么男子气的男人竟如此地易于导致性格软弱；他们对于无意识的态度有一种女性的柔弱和多愁善感。相反，常有这样的情形，一个典型的女性，在她的内心生活中，却有极其倔强、执拗和刚愎的性格；这些性格所具有的强烈程度往往只出现在男人的外在态度中。这些是男性的特征，由于为女性的外在态度所排斥而不得不变成了她的灵魂的品质。

If, therefore, we speak of the *anima* of a man, we must logically speak of the *animus* of a woman, if we are to give the soul of a woman its right name. Whereas logic and objectivity are usually the predominant features of a man’s outer attitude, or are at least regarded as ideals, in the case of a woman it is feeling. But in the soul it is the other way round: inwardly it is the man who feels, and the woman who reflects. Hence a man’s greater liability to total despair, while a woman can always find comfort and hope; accordingly a man is more likely to put an end to himself than a woman. However much a victim of social circumstances a woman may be, as a prostitute for instance, a man is no less a victim of impulses from the unconscious, taking the form of alcoholism and other vices.

因此，如果我们谈到男性的阿尼玛，就必然要谈到女性的阿尼姆斯（animus），假如我们想要给女性的灵魂一个正确的名称的话。逻辑和客观性通常在男性的外在态度中占据优势，至少被当作一种理想，而在女性那里则是情感占据优势。但在灵魂中这种关系恰恰相反：从内在方面来看，男子是感觉的，而女性却是思考的了。因此，男性很容易陷于完全绝望，而女性却总是能找到安慰和希望；所以，男性比女性更容易自行了断生命。然而，不管一个女人将会怎样卑躬屈膝地沦为社会环境的牺牲品，比如卖淫，男人也可能同样地以酒精中毒和其他恶行的方式沦为无意识冲动的牺牲品。

As to its common human qualities, the character of the anima can be deduced from that of the persona. Everything that should normally be in the outer attitude, but is conspicuously absent, will invariably be found in the inner attitude. This is a fundamental rule which my experience has borne out over and over again. But as regards its individual qualities, nothing can be deduced about them in this way. We can only be certain that when a man is identical with his persona, his individual qualities will be associated with the anima. This association frequently gives rise in dreams to the symbol of psychic pregnancy, a symbol that goes back to the *primordial image* (q.v.) of the hero’s birth. The child that is to be born signifies the individuality, which, though present, is not yet conscious. For in the same way as the persona, the instrument of adaptation to the environment, is strongly influenced by environmental conditions, the anima is shaped by the unconscious and its qualities. In a primitive milieu the persona necessarily takes on primitive features, and the anima similarly takes over the *archaic* (q.v.) features of the unconscious as well as its symbolic, prescient character. Hence the “pregnant,” “creative” qualities of the inner attitude.

就其共同的人性而言，阿尼玛的特征可以从人格面具的特征推断出来。所有在正常情况下应该出现在外部态度中然而在那里又明显找不到的东西，总是能在内部态度中找到。这是一条基本的规律，我的经验反复证明了这一点。但是，至于阿尼玛的个人品质，则完全无法从这一方式推演出来。我们仅仅能够确定，当一个人与他的人格面具相等同时，他的个人品质将与他的阿尼玛相联系。这种联系通常出现在梦中，表现为精神受孕的象征，该象征可追溯到英雄诞生的原初意象。如此降生的孩童即意指个性，虽然它已出现，但仍然不是有意识的。正如作为适应环境的工具的人格面具强有力地受到环境的影响一样，阿尼玛也同样为无意识及其本性所铸造。在原初环境中，人格面具必然呈现出原初的特征，而阿尼玛也就同样具有了无意识的古代式特征，并且带有其象征的、预示的特性。因此，其内在态度“孕育的”（pregnant）和“创造性的”品质就产生了。

*Identity* (q.v.) with the persona automatically leads to an unconscious identity with the anima because, when the ego is not differentiated from the persona, it can have no conscious relation to the unconscious processes. Consequently, it *is* these processes, it is identical with them. Anyone who is himself his outward role will infallibly succumb to the inner processes; he will either frustrate his outward role by absolute inner necessity or else reduce it to absurdity, by a process of *enantiodromia* (q.v.). He can no longer keep to his individual way, and his life runs into one deadlock after another. Moreover, the anima is inevitably projected upon a real object, with which he gets into a relation of almost total dependence. Every reaction displayed by this object has an immediate, inwardly enervating effect on the subject. Tragic ties are often formed in this way (v. *Soul-image*).

与人格面具的同一将自发地导致与阿尼玛的无意识的同一，因为，当自我没有与人格面具相区分时，它不可能意识到与无意识过程的联系。因此，它本身就是这些过程，与它们完全同一。任何其本身即就是他的外在角色的人将确切无疑地屈从于他的内在过程；他将通过绝对的内在需要去挫败他的外在角色，或者借助对立形态的过程使其陷于荒谬的境地。他可能不再依循他的个人道路，他的生命走入了一个接一个的死结。此外，他的阿尼玛（灵魂）不可避免地被投射到一个现实的对象中，陷入一种对此对象近乎完全依赖的关系。从此对象所产生出来的每一个反应，对主体都有一种直接的、使之内在衰弱的影响力。悲剧情结通常即是以这种方式（参见“灵魂-意象”条）形成的。

## 49. 灵魂-意象 (soul-image)，阿尼玛/阿尼姆斯 (Anima/Animus)

SOUL-IMAGE \[Anima / Animus\]. The soul-image is a specific *image* (q.v.) among those produced by the unconscious. Just as the *persona* (v. *Soul*), or outer attitude, is represented in dreams by images of definite persons who possess the outstanding qualities of the persona in especially marked form, so in a man the soul, i.e., anima, or inner attitude, is represented in the unconscious by definite persons with the corresponding qualities. Such an image is called a “soul-image.” Sometimes these images are of quite unknown or mythological figures. With men the anima is usually personified by the unconscious as a woman; with women the animus is personified as a man. In every case where the *individuality* (q.v.) is unconscious, and therefore associated with the soul, the soul-image has the character of the same sex. In all cases where there is an *identity* (q.v.) with the persona, and the soul accordingly is unconscious, the soul-image is transferred to a real person. This person is the object of intense love or equally intense hate (or fear). The influence of such a person is immediate and absolutely compelling, because it always provokes an affective response. The *affect* (q.v.) is due to the fact that a real, conscious adaptation to the person representing the soul-image is impossible. Because an objective relationship is non-existent and out of the question, the *libido* (q.v.) gets dammed up and explodes in an outburst of affect. Affects always occur where there is a failure of adaptation. Conscious adaptation to the person representing the soul-image is impossible precisely because the subject is unconscious of the soul. Were he conscious of it, it could be distinguished from the object, whose immediate effects might then be mitigated, since the potency of the object depends on the *projection* (q.v.) of the soul-image.

灵魂-意象在那些无意识所产生的意象中是一种特殊的意象。正像人格面具或外在态度在梦中由某些人的意象所体现一样，这些人以特别显著的形式拥有人格面具的外在性质，同样地，一个人的灵魂即阿尼玛或内部态度也在无意识中由某些具有相应性质的人所体现。这些意象被称为“灵魂-意象”。有时这些意象完全不为我们所知，或者是神话的人物。就男人来说，阿尼玛通常被无意识人格化为一个女性；而对女人来说，其阿尼姆斯则常被人格化为一位男性。在所有个性都是无意识的因而与灵魂相联系的情况下，灵魂-意象就具有了同一性别的特征。在所有存在与人格面具相同一并且灵魂因此是无意识的情况下，灵魂-意象就转变成了真实的人。这个人是强烈的爱或同等强烈的恨（或恐惧）的对象。该人的影响力是直接地、绝对强迫性的，因为它总是唤起人们感情上的反应。这种感情源于这样一个事实，真正有意识地适应代表灵魂-意象的那个人是不可能存在的。因为一种客观的关系无疑是不可能存在的，于是欲力受到了阻碍，只能以感情的爆发来宣泄。感情总是出现在适应失败的地方。有意识地去适应代表灵魂-意象的那个人之确实不可能，只是因为主体无法意识到他的灵魂。倘若他意识到了灵魂，他就同对象区别开来了，其对象的直接影响力就可能被消除了，因为对象的力量取决于灵魂-意象的投射。

For a man, a woman is best fitted to be the real bearer of his soul-image, because of the feminine quality of his soul; for a woman it will be a man. Wherever an impassioned, almost magical, relationship exists between the sexes, it is invariably a question of a projected soul-image. Since these relationships are very common, the soul must be unconscious just as frequently—that is, vast numbers of people must be quite unaware of the way they are related to their inner psychic processes. Because this unconsciousness is always coupled with complete identification with the persona, it follows that this identification must be very frequent too. And in actual fact very many people are wholly identified with their outer attitude and therefore have no conscious relation to their inner processes. Conversely, it may also happen that the soul-image is not projected but remains with the subject, and this results in an identification with the soul because the subject is then convinced that the way he relates to his inner processes is his real character. In that event the persona, being unconscious, will be projected on a person of the same sex, thus providing a foundation for many cases of open or latent homosexuality, and of father-transferences in men or mother-transferences in women. In such cases there is always a defective adaptation to external reality and a lack of relatedness, because identification with the soul produces an attitude predominantly oriented to the perception of inner processes, and the object is deprived of its determining power.

对男人来说，由于他灵魂中的女性性质，女人是他的灵魂-意象最适合的真正负载者；而对女人来说，这位负载者将是男人。无论在什么地方，只要两性之间存在着一种充溢激情的近乎魔力的关系，就必然存在投射灵魂-意象的问题。既然这种关系是非常普遍的，那么正如常所见到的那样，灵魂就必然是无意识的——即是说，绝大多数人必然完全没有意识到他们与内在心理过程保持联系的方式。因为这种无意识状态总是与对人格面具完全的认同联结在一起，使得这样的认同一再出现。事实确实如此，大多数人完全与他们的外在态度相等同，因而根本就没有意识到与他们的内在过程的联系。但相反的情形也可能发生，灵魂-意象并没有被投射，而是保留在主体内，这就会导致对灵魂的认同，因为主体深信他与自己内在过程的联系方式乃是他的真实性格。在这种情况下，作为无意识存在的人格面具将被投射在同一性别的人身上，这就为众多公开的或潜在的同性恋事例提供了基础，为许多男性中的父性-移情作用（father-transferences）或女性中的母性-移情作用（mother-transferences）事例提供了基础。在这些事例中，总是存在一种对外在现实有缺陷的适应和一种有缺陷的联系，因为对灵魂的认同作用产生出一种绝对定向于内在过程的知觉的态度，客体的决定性力量被剥夺了。

If the soul-image is projected, the result is an absolute affective tie to the object. If it is not projected, a relatively unadapted state develops, which Freud has described as *narcissism*. The projection of the soul-image offers a release from preoccupation with one’s inner processes so long as the behaviour of the object is in harmony with the soul-image. The subject is then in a position to live out his persona and develop it further. The object, however, will scarcely be able to meet the demands of the soul-image indefinitely, although there are many women who, by completely disregarding their own lives, succeed in representing their husband’s soul-image for a very long time. The biological feminine instinct assists them in this. A man may unconsciously do the same for his wife, though this will prompt him to deeds which finally exceed his capacities whether for good or evil. Here again the biological masculine instinct is a help.

一旦灵魂-意象得到投射，就会出现一种系于客体的绝对的影响力。倘若它未被投射，一种相对不适应的状态就将得到发展，弗洛伊德将之描述为自恋（narcissism）。只要对于对象的行为与灵魂-意象保持一致，灵魂-意象的投射就将使某人对内部过程的过度专注得到缓和。于是主体突破他的人格面具取得了生存中的一定的位置，有了进一步发展的能力。然而，客体几乎很少能够迎合极不明确的灵魂-意象的要求，尽管有许多女性通过完全忽视她们自己的生活，而能长期成功地体现她们的丈夫的灵魂-意象。在这点上，生物性的女性本能帮助了她们。一个男人为了他的妻子也可能无意识地做同样的事情，虽然这会怂恿他去干那些无论好坏最终都将超出他的能力的事情。这里同样借助于生物性的男性本能的帮助。

If the soul-image is not projected, a thoroughly morbid relation to the unconscious gradually develops. The subject is increasingly overwhelmed by unconscious contents, which his inadequate relation to the object makes him powerless to assimilate or put to any kind of use, so that the whole subject-object relation only deteriorates further. Naturally these two attitudes represent the two extremes between which the more normal attitudes lie. In a normal man the soul-image is not distinguished by any particular clarity, purity, or depth, but is apt to be rather blurred. In men with a good-natured and unaggressive persona, the soul-image has a rather malevolent character. A good literary example of this is the daemonic woman who is the companion of Zeus in Spitteler’s *Olympian Spring*. For an idealistic woman, a depraved man is often the bearer of the soul-image; hence the “saviour fantasy” so frequent in such cases. The same thing happens with men, when the prostitute is surrounded with the halo of a soul crying for succour.

如果灵魂-意象没有被投射，那么就会逐渐发展为一种完全病态的与无意识的联系。主体日益为无意识的内容所淹没，他与客体有缺陷的适应关系使他无力同化或以任何其他的方式使用这些无意识内容，这样主-客体之间的关系只能变得进一步的恶化。自然，这两种态度仅仅代表了两种极端，而正常的态度位于两个极端之间。正常人的灵魂-意象并不具有特别明晰、纯粹或深刻的特征，而恰恰是相当模糊的。在那些有着和蔼而不具侵略性的人格面具的人身上，其灵魂-意象通常具有相当狠毒的特征。斯比特勒的《奥林匹斯之春》中那个陪伴着宙斯的恶魔般的女人就是一个最佳的文学例证。对一个理想主义的女人来说，堕落的男人常常是她灵魂-意象的承载者；因而这种“救赎的幻想”时刻萦绕在她心头。同样的事情也常发生在男人身上，这时，妓女就被笼罩了一个疾呼救助的灵魂的光环。

## 50. 主观层面 (subjective level)

When I speak of interpreting a dream or fantasy on the subjective level, I mean that the persons or situations appearing in it refer to subjective factors entirely belonging to the subject’s own psyche. As we know, the psychic image of an object is never exactly like the object—at most there is a near resemblance. It is the product of sense perception and *apperception* (q.v.), and these are processes that are inherent in the psyche and are merely stimulated by the object. Although the evidence of our senses is found to coincide very largely with the qualities of the object, our apperception is conditioned by unpredictable subjective influences which render a correct knowledge of the object extraordinarily difficult. Moreover, such a complex psychic factor as a man’s character offers only a few *points d’appui* for pure sense perception. Knowledge of human character requires *empathy* (q.v.), reflection, *intuition* (q.v.). As a result of these complications, our final judgment is always of very doubtful value, so that the image we form of a human object is, to a very large extent, subjectively conditioned. In practical psychology, therefore, we would do well to make a rigorous distinction between the image or *imago* of a man and his real existence. Because of its extremely subjective origin, the *imago* is frequently more an image of a subjective functional complex than of the object itself. In the analytical treatment of unconscious products it is essential that the *imago* should not be assumed to be identical with the object; it is better to regard it as an image of the subjective relation to the object. That is what is meant by interpretation on the subjective level.

当我从主观层面来论述对梦或幻想的解释时，我意指这些梦或幻想中出现的人物和情境，所涉及的是纯属主体自己心理的主观因素。众所周知，对于客体的心理意象绝不完全等同于客体——它们至多存在某种接近的相似性。它是感官知觉和统觉的产物，而知觉和统觉则是内在于心理和纯粹来自客体刺激的过程。虽然我们的感觉事件在很大程度上被认为与客体的性质相一致，但是我们的统觉则受到难以预测的主观影响的限制，这使得对客体的正确认识变得极其困难。况且，作为人类性格的这种复杂的心理因素仅仅给纯粹的感官知觉提供了很少的几个支点（points dappui）。对人类性格的认识还需要移情、反思和直觉。由于这种种复杂因素。我们的最后判断总是具有非常可疑的价值，所以在很大程度上，我们对人的对象（客体）所形成的意象必然受到主观条件的限制。因此，在实用心理学领域，我们最好能将一个人的意象或成像（imago）与他的现实存在严格区分开来。通常，成像更多地属于一种主观功能集丛的意象，而不是关于客体本身的意象。在对无意识产物的分析治疗中，最基本的要求是不能假设成像与客体相等同；最好把它看作一种与客体的主观关系的意象。这就是所谓主观层面的解释的意义。

Interpretation of an unconscious product on the subjective level reveals the presence of subjective judgments and tendencies of which the object is made the vehicle. When, therefore, an object-imago appears in an unconscious product, it is not on that account the image of a real object; it is far more likely that we are dealing with a subjective functional complex (v. *Soul*, pars. 798ff.). Interpretation on the subjective level allows us to take a broader psychological view not only of dreams but also of literary works, in which the individual figures then appear as representatives of relatively autonomous functional complexes in the psyche of the author.

从主观层面对无意识产物的解释，揭示了主观判断及主观倾向的存在，客体被当作这种判断和倾向的载体。所以，当一个客体-成像出现在无意识产物中时，它不能被当作现实客体的意象，而更多地类似于我们所讨论过的主观功能的集丛或情结（参见“灵魂”条）。主观层面的解释使我们不仅对梦而且对文学作品都获得了一种更宽广的视野，这样在文学作品中个性的人物便表现为作者心理中相对自主的功能情结的代表。

## 51. 象征 (symbol)

The concept of a *symbol* should in my view be strictly distinguished from that of a *sign*. Symbolic and *semiotic* meanings are entirely different things. In his book on symbolism, Ferrero does not speak of symbols in the strict sense, but of signs. For instance, the old custom of handing over a piece of turf at the sale of a plot of land might be described as “symbolic” in the vulgar sense of the word, but actually it is purely semiotic in character. The piece of turf is a sign, or token, standing for the whole estate. The winged wheel worn by railway officials is not a *symbol* of the railway, but a *sign* that distinguishes the personnel of the railway system. A symbol always presupposes that the chosen expression is the best possible description or formulation of a relatively unknown fact, which is none the less known to exist or is postulated as existing. Thus, when the badge of a railway official is explained as a symbol, it amounts to saying that this man has something to do with an unknown system that cannot be differently or better expressed than by a winged wheel.

在我看来，象征的概念应该与符号（sign）的概念严格区开来分。象征的意义与符号的（semiotic）意义是完全不同的东西。在费雷罗（Ferrero）关于象征主义的著作中，他并没有从严格的意义上来讨论象征，而只是讨论了符号。例如，有一种在出卖一块土地时要交出一块草皮的旧风俗，这可以在该词模糊的意义上将其描绘为“象征的”，但实际上它纯粹具有符号的特征。这块草皮是一个符号或记号，代表整块土地。铁路官员佩戴的翼轮徽章并不是铁路的象征，而是用以区分铁路系统全体工作人员的符号。一个象征总是这样的预设，被选择的表达方式乃是对某一相对未知事实的最恰当的描述或阐释，这个事实仍然被认为存在着，或是假定它存在着。因此，当铁路官员的翼轮徽章被解释为象征时，这就无异是说这个人具有某种涉及到未知的系统的东西，除了用翼轮来表达外再也没有别的或更好的表达方式了。

Every view which interprets the symbolic expression as an analogue or an abbreviated designation for a *known*thing is *semiotic*. A view which interprets the symbolic expression as the best possible formulation of a relatively *unknown* thing, which for that reason cannot be more clearly or characteristically represented, is *symbolic*. A view which interprets the symbolic expression as an intentional paraphrase or transmogrification of a known thing is *allegoric*. The interpretation of the cross as a symbol of divine love is *semiotic*, because “divine love” describes the fact to be expressed better and more aptly than a cross, which can have many other meanings. On the other hand, an interpretation of the cross is *symbolic* when it puts the cross beyond all conceivable explanations, regarding it as expressing an as yet unknown and incomprehensible fact of a mystical or transcendent, i.e., psychological, nature, which simply finds itself most appropriately represented in the cross.

任何把象征表达理解为一种对已知事物做类比的或缩略的意指的观点都只能是符号的。而把象征表达理解为对一个相对未知的事物做最恰当的阐释，因而难以对之作出更清晰更具特征的表达的观点是象征的。那种把象征表达理解为一种对已知事物的有意改写或使之变形的观点是比喻的（allegoric）。把十字架理解为一种圣爱（Divine Love）的象征是符号的解释，因为“圣爱”描述了比十字架更好和更贴切地表达的事实，它可能包含许多其他的意义。相反，当其把十字架置放到超出于所有可能想象得到的解释之外，视为对仍然未知的难以理解的神秘事实或超验事实——即心理本质——的表达时，这种对十字架的解释就是象征的了，它最恰当地直接找到了体现在十字架中的意义。

So long as a symbol is a living thing, it is an expression for something that cannot be characterized in any other or better way. The symbol is alive only so long as it is pregnant with meaning. But once its meaning has been born out of it, once that expression is found which formulates the thing sought, expected, or divined even better than the hitherto accepted symbol, then the symbol is *dead*, i.e., it possesses only an historical significance. We may still go on speaking of it as a symbol, on the tacit assumption that we are speaking of it as it was before the better expression was born out of it. The way in which St. Paul and the earlier speculative mystics speak of the cross shows that for them it was still a living symbol which expressed the inexpressible in unsurpassable form. For every esoteric interpretation the symbol is dead, because esotericism has already given it (at least ostensibly) a better expression, whereupon it becomes merely a conventional sign for associations that are more completely and better known elsewhere. Only from the exoteric standpoint is the symbol a living thing.

就象征作为一种有生命力的东西来说，它是一种对某物无法用任何其他的或更好的方法来刻画的表现方式。只有当象征孕育着（pregnant with）意义时，它才是富于生命的。但是，一旦其意义被和盘托出（born out of it），一旦这样的表达形式被找到，它甚至比迄今为止可接受的象征能更好地系统地阐释那些寻求、期待或预见的东西，那么，象征就死去了，而仅仅具有历史的意义。我们或许仍然可以作为一种象征来谈论它，但那只是基于一种心照不宣的假设，即我们是在能穷尽它的意义的更好的表现形式尚未产生之前来谈论它的。圣保罗（St.Paul）和早期神秘思辨论者用以谈论十字架的方法表明，在他们看来，十字架仍然是一种有生命力的象征，它以无法超越的形式表达了难以表达的东西。对于任何秘教的（esoteric）解释来说，象征都是死去了的，因为秘教主义已经赋予了象征（至少表面上如此）一种更好的表达方式，于是象征纯粹成了一种约定俗成的用于联想符号，而这些联想在其他地方早已为人们所烂熟于心了。只有从显教（exoteric）的观点来看，象征才是有生命的。

An expression that stands for a known thing remains a mere sign and is never a symbol. It is, therefore, quite impossible to create a living symbol, i.e., one that is pregnant with meaning, from known associations. For what is thus produced never contains more than was put into it. Every psychic product, if it is the best possible expression at the moment for a fact as yet unknown or only relatively known, may be regarded as a symbol, provided that we accept the expression as standing for something that is only divined and not yet clearly conscious. Since every scientific theory contains an hypothesis, and is therefore an anticipatory description of something still essentially unknown, it is a symbol. Furthermore, every psychological expression is a symbol if we assume that it states or signifies something more and other than itself which eludes our present knowledge. This assumption is absolutely tenable wherever a consciousness exists which is attuned to the deeper meaning of things. It is untenable only when this same consciousness has itself devised an expression which states exactly what it is intended to state—a mathematical term, for instance. But for another consciousness this limitation does not exist. It can take the mathematical term as a symbol for an unknown psychic fact which the term was not intended to express but is concealed within it—a fact which is demonstrably not known to the man who devised the semiotic expression and which therefore could not have been the object of any conscious use.

一个代表已知事物的表达仍然只是符号而绝不是象征。所以，要想从已知的联想中创造出有生命力的、亦即孕育着意义的象征是完全不可能的。因为这样创造出来的东西绝不包含超出于放进去的东西。任何心理产物只要在当时是对一种仍然未知的或仅仅相对已知的事实的最具可能性的表达时，便可视之为一种象征，它规定着我们所接受的这种表达，代表着那些仅仅作为预测但仍未清晰意识到的东西。既然所有科学理论都包含一种假设，因而是对某种基本上仍属未知的事物的预期性描述，那么科学理论便也是象征。更进一步说，每一种心理表述都是象征，倘若我们假设它所陈述或意指的东西更多于或超出了其本身，因而也超越了我们现有的知识的话。在任何存在着意识与事物的深层意义相协调的地方，这种假设就绝对是可能的。就这同一个意识而言，只有当它本身构想出一种能够准确陈述它所想要陈述的东西的表达形式——例如一个数学术语——时，那么这种假设才是不可能的。但是，对另一种意识来说，这种限制并不存在。它可以把这个数学术语当作一个适应于未知的心理事实的象征，数学术语并未有意地用来表达心理事实，而是将其隐含其中——因为心理事实显然不为构想出这个表述符号（数学术语）的人所知，因此它也不能成为任何意识所能运用的对象。

Whether a thing is a symbol or not depends chiefly on the *attitude* (q.v.) of the observing consciousness; for instance, on whether it regards a given fact not merely as such but also as an expression for something unknown. Hence it is quite possible for a man to establish a fact which does not appear in the least symbolic to himself, but is profoundly so to another consciousness. The converse is also true. There are undoubtedly products whose symbolic character does not depend merely on the attitude of the observing consciousness, but manifests itself spontaneously in the symbolic effect they have on the observer. Such products are so constituted that they would lack any kind of meaning were not a symbolic one conceded to them. Taken as a bare fact, a triangle with an eye enclosed in it is so meaningless that it is impossible for the observer to regard it as a merely accidental piece of foolery. Such a figure immediately conjures up a symbolic interpretation. This effect is reinforced by the widespread incidence of the same figure in identical form, or by the particular care that went into its production, which is an expression of the special value placed upon it.

一个事物是否成为一种象征主要取决于进行观察的意识的态度；例如，取决于它是否并不仅仅把某一既定事实看作既定事实，而是也将之视为对某种未知事物的表达。因此完全可能的是，一个人创造了一个在他看来毫无象征意义的事实，而这个事实的象征意义在另一个人看来却是如此的深刻。相反的情形也可能出现。毫无疑问，存在一些这样的产品，它们的象征特征并不仅仅取决于从事观察的意识的态度，而且也会从它们对观察者所施加的象征性影响中自发地显示出来。这些产品被如此地构成，以致除了赋予它们的象征的意义之外，它们就别无任何的意义了。举一个浅显的事实，一个内有一只眼睛的三角形，它是如此的没有意义，以致对于观察者来说甚至都不可能将它视为一种纯粹偶然的胡乱涂鸦。但是，这个图形可能立刻唤起一种象征的解释。这种自发的效应由于同一个图形以同样的形式反复出现而得到强化，或者因为将特别的关注投入了它的创造中而得到强化，这样，它成了对赋予它的特殊价值的表达。

Symbols that do not work in this way on the observer are either extinct, i.e., have been superseded by a better formulation, or are products whose symbolic nature depends entirely on the attitude of the observing consciousness. The attitude that takes a given phenomenon as symbolic may be called, for short, the *symbolic attitude*. It is only partially justified by the actual behaviour of things; for the rest, it is the outcome of a definite view of the world which *assigns meaning* to events, whether great or small, and attaches to this meaning a greater value than to bare facts. This view of things stands opposed to another view which lays the accent on sheer facts and subordinates meaning to them. For the latter attitude there can be no symbols whatever when the symbolism depends exclusively on the mode of observation. But even for such an attitude symbols do exist—those, namely, that prompt the observer to conjecture a hidden meaning. A bull-headed god can certainly be explained as a man’s body with a bull’s head on it. But this explanation can hardly hold its own against the symbolic explanation, because the symbolism is too arresting to be overlooked. A symbol that forcibly obtrudes its symbolic nature on us need not be a *living*symbol. It may have a merely historical or philosophical significance, and simply arouses intellectual or aesthetic interest. A symbol really lives only when it is the best and highest expression for something divined but not yet known to the observer. It then compels his unconscious participation and has a life-giving and life-enhancing effect. As Faust says: “How differently this new sign works upon me!”

不能以这种方式对观察者起作用的象征即是死去了的象征，也就是说，它不是已经被更好的阐释方式所取代，就是成为了其象征的性质完全取决于观察意识的态度的产物。将特定的现象视为象征性的这种态度可简要地称为象征的态度（symbolical attitude）。它只能部分地为事物的实际行为所证实；而其余的部分，则是某种特定的世界观的产物，世界观将意义赋予各种大小事件，这些附加的意义具有超越事实本身的价值。这种关于事物的观点与另一种观点形成对立，它只看重纯粹的事实，使意义屈从于事实。就这后一种态度而言，只要象征的性质完全依赖于观察的方式，就绝对不可能有象征存在。但即便是这样一种态度，象征还是存在的——即指那些激发观察者去预设一种潜在的意义的象征。一个牛首神的意象当然可被解释为一个长着牛首的人的身躯。但这种解释本身几乎完全无法抗拒象征的解释，因为象征的方式太具有魅力了，以致完全不能被忽视。一个需要竭力把象征的性质强加给我们的象征不是有生命力的象征。它或许具有一种纯粹历史的或哲学的意义，只能唤起理智的或审美的趣味。只有当象征成为最好的和最高的表达形式，用来表达某些可预测的但又仍然不为观察者所知的东西时，它才是真正有生命力的象征。这样，它诱发了无意识的参与，具有了生命-赋予和生命-提升的效应。正如浮士德所说：“这个新的标志对我产生的影响是多么的不同啊！”

The living symbol formulates an essential unconscious factor, and the more widespread this factor is, the more general is the effect of the symbol, for it touches a corresponding chord in every psyche. Since, for a given epoch, it is the best possible expression for what is still unknown, it must be the product of the most complex and differentiated minds of that age. But in order to have such an effect at all, it must embrace what is common to a large group of men. This can never be what is most differentiated, the highest attainable, for only a very few attain to that or understand it. The common factor must be something that is still so primitive that its ubiquity cannot be doubted. Only when the symbol embraces that and expresses it in the highest possible form is it of general efficacy. Herein lies the potency of the living, social symbol and its redeeming power.

有生命力的象征合理地配置了基本的无意识因素，这种因素越是分布广泛，其象征的作用也就越是普遍；因为它触动了所有心理中每一根与之相应的琴弦。就每一个回响而言，既然它是对那些仍然未知的事物的最具可能性的表达方式，那么它就必然是那个时代最复杂最具差异性的心灵的产品。但是，为了最终达到这样的效果，它必然囊括广大人群所共同具有的东西。它就绝不可能是最大分化程度的东西和最高的获得物，因为只有极少数的人能获得它或理解它。普遍的因素必然是某种仍然如此原初的以致毫无疑问地无所不在的东西。只有当象征囊括了它并以最大可能性的形式表达了它时，它才具有普遍的功效。有生命力的、社会性象征的威力及其救赎的力量正在于此。

All that I have said about the social symbol applies equally to the individual symbol. There are individual psychic products whose symbolic character is so obvious that they at once compel a symbolic interpretation. For the individual they have the same functional significance that the social symbol has for a larger human group. These products never have an exclusively conscious or an exclusively unconscious source, but arise from the equal collaboration of both. Purely unconscious products are no more convincingly symbolic *per se* than purely conscious ones; it is the symbolic attitude of the observing consciousness that endows them both with the character of a symbol. But they can be conceived equally well as causally determined facts, in much the same way as one might regard the red exanthema of scarlet fever as a “symbol” of the disease. In that case it is perfectly correct to speak of a “symptom” and not of a “symbol.” In my view Freud is quite justified when, from his standpoint, he speaks of *symptomatic* rather than symbolic actions, since for him these phenomena are not symbolic in the sense here defined, but are symptomatic signs of a definite and generally known underlying process. There are, of course, neurotics who regard their unconscious products, which are mostly morbid symptoms, as symbols of supreme importance. Generally, however, this is not what happens. On the contrary, the neurotic of today is only too prone to regard a product that may actually be full of significance as a mere “symptom.”

我曾论述过的有关社会性象征的一切同样也适用于个体象征。有些个体心理产品，其象征特征是如此的明显以致它们会立即引发象征的阐释。它们对个体所具有的功能意义，就像社会象征对于一个较大的社会团体所具有的功能意义一样。这些产品绝非唯一具有意识的根源或无意识的根源，而是源自两者的协调合作。纯粹的无意识产品本质上（per se）并不比纯粹的意识产品具有更多令人信服的象征性力量；将象征特征赋予它们两者的是进行观察的意识的象征性态度。但是，它们可能被同样恰当地当作一个因果性决定的事实，正如以同样的方式人们可以把猩红热的红疹当作疾病的“象征”。但在此情形下，与其说是一种“象征”不如说是一种“症状”要更准确一些。在我看来，弗洛伊德根据他的观点，当他论及作为症状的行为而不是作为象征的行为时，他是相当正确的。因为在他看来，这些现象并不是这里所界定的意义上的象征，而是特定的和为人所熟知的潜在过程的症状性符号。当然，有一些心理症患者，他们把主要是病态症状的无意识产品视之为绝对重要的象征。然而一般说来，情况并不是这样。相反，今天的心理症患者太易于把实际上可能充满意义的产品视之为“症状”了。

The fact that there are two distinct and mutually contradictory views eagerly advocated on either side concerning the meaning or meaninglessness of things shows that processes obviously exist which express no particular meaning, being in fact mere consequences, or symptoms; and that there are other processes which bear within them a hidden meaning, processes which are not merely derived from something but which seek to become something, and are therefore symbols. It is left to our discretion and our critical judgment to decide whether the thing we are dealing with is a symptom or a symbol.

存在两种明显对立而又相互矛盾的观点，它们各执一边地激烈争辩事物的有无意义，这一事实表明，明显存在着这样的过程，它们并不表达任何特别的意义，而仅仅作为结果或症状出现；并且也存在另外一些其中包含着潜在意义的过程，它们不仅源于某些东西，而且寻求变成某种东西，因而它们是象征。要决定我们正在观察的东西是症状还是象征，得靠我们的辨别力和批判的判断力。

The symbol is always a product of an extremely complex nature, since data from every psychic function have gone into its making. It is, therefore, neither *rational* nor *irrational* (qq.v.). It certainly has a side that accords with reason, but it has another side that does not; for it is composed not only of rational but also of irrational data supplied by pure inner and outer perception. The profundity and pregnant significance of the symbol appeal just as strongly to *thinking* as to *feeling* (qq.v.), while its peculiar plastic imagery, when shaped into sensuous form, stimulates *sensation* as much as *intuition* (qq.v.). The living symbol cannot come to birth in a dull or poorly developed mind, for such a mind will be content with the already existing symbols offered by established tradition. Only the passionate yearning of a highly developed mind, for which the traditional symbol is no longer the unified expression of the rational and the irrational, of the highest and the lowest, can create a new symbol.

象征总是一种最终具有复合性质的产物，因为来自各种心理功能的材料都汇入了它的构成中。因此它既不是理性的也不是非理性的。它确实具有合乎理性的一面，但也具有不合乎理性的另一面；因为它不仅由理性材料所构成，而且也由纯粹内在的和外在的知觉所提供的非理性的材料所构成。正像象征的深厚意蕴及其孕育的意义诉求于强有力的思维和强有力的情感一样，它的特殊的可塑性意象——当其在感官知觉的形式中塑形时——也会激发感觉和激发直觉。有生命力的象征不可能诞生在呆滞的或低度发展的心灵里，因为这样的心灵满足于固定的传统所提供的已经存在的象征。只有那种热切渴望高度发展的心灵才能创造新的象征，因为对于它们来说，传统的象征已经不再具有那种将理性的和非理性的、最高的和最低的东西统一起来的表达形式了。

But precisely because the new symbol is born of man’s highest spiritual aspirations and must at the same time spring from the deepest roots of his being, it cannot be a onesided product of the most highly differentiated mental functions but must derive equally from the lowest and most primitive levels of the psyche. For this collaboration of opposing states to be possible at all, they must first face one another in the fullest conscious opposition. This necessarily entails a violent disunion with oneself, to the point where thesis and antithesis negate one another, while the ego is forced to acknowledge its absolute participation in both. If there is a subordination of one part, the symbol will be predominantly the product of the other part, and, to that extent, less a symbol than a symptom—a symptom of the suppressed antithesis. To the extent, however, that a symbol is merely a symptom, it also lacks a redeeming effect, since it fails to express the full right of all parts of the psyche to exist, being a constant reminder of the suppressed antithesis even though consciousness may not take this fact into account. But when there is full parity of the opposites, attested by the ego’s absolute participation in both, this necessarily leads to a suspension of the *will* (q.v.), for the will can no longer operate when every motive has an equally strong countermotive. Since life cannot tolerate a standstill, a damming up of vital energy results, and this would lead to an insupportable condition did not the tension of opposites produce a new, uniting function that transcends them. This function arises quite naturally from the regression of *libido*(q.v.) caused by the blockage. All progress having been rendered temporarily impossible by the total division of the will, the libido streams backwards, as it were, to its source. In other words, the neutralization and inactivity of consciousness bring about an activity of the unconscious, where all the differentiated functions have their common, archaic root, and where all contents exist in a state of promiscuity of which the primitive mentality still shows numerous vestiges.

但是，更确切地说，由于新的象征诞生于人的最高度的精神亢奋中，同时也必定诞生于人的最深层的存在根基中，所以它不可能是具有最高分化程度的心理功能的片面性产物，而必然同样地产生于最低下的和最原初的心理层面。就这种对立状况的联合最终是可能的而言，它们必然首先与最强烈的意识对立面彼此相对。这必然在一个人的内心里出现一场激烈的交战，达到正面与反面相互否定的程度，同时自我也被迫认识到它将绝对站到那一边。倘若一方被降伏的情形出现，那么象征将决定性地成为另一方的产物，处于这种情况下，它很少是象征而成为了症状——被压抑的一方的症状。然而，就象征在某种程度上纯粹作为一种症状而言，它也就缺乏救赎的作用，因为它无法充分表达所有心理部分存在的权力，而仅仅成为了一种被压抑的一方的持续的暗示，尽管意识可能完全没有看到这个事实。但是，一旦出现对立双方处于势均力敌的状况，并且为自我确切无疑地加入双方而证实了这种情形时，这就必然导致意志的难以决断，因为当每一种动机都伴随着同样有力的反-动机时，意志就不再可能发挥作用了。既然生命不能容忍这种停滞的现象，那么生命能量的阻积就会发生，倘若对立双方的紧张无法产生出一种新的能协调的功能，以超越对立双方的话，就将导致一种难以承受的状况。因为阻积的原因，这种新的功能相当自然地从欲力的回归中产生出来。由于意志的完全分裂，使得任何的前行暂时都没有可能，欲力就只好向后流动，或许一直回流到它的发源地。换句话说，意识的中立和不活跃引发了无意识的活跃，在那里，所有已分化的功能都具有它们共同的古代的根源，在那里，所有的内容都存在于混杂的状态中，原初精神仍表明它们大量地残留于其中。

From the activity of the unconscious there now emerges a new content, constellated by thesis and antithesis in equal measure and standing in a *compensatory*(q.v.) relation to both. It thus forms the middle ground on which the opposites can be united. If, for instance, we conceive the opposition to be sensuality versus spirituality, then the mediatory content born out of the unconscious provides a welcome means of expression for the spiritual thesis, because of its rich spiritual associations, and also for the sensual antithesis, because of its sensuous imagery. The ego, however, torn between thesis and antithesis, finds in the middle ground its own counterpart, its sole and unique means of expression, and it eagerly seizes on this in order to be delivered from its division. The energy created by the tension of opposites therefore flows into the mediatory product and protects it from the conflict which immediately breaks out again, for both the opposites are striving to get the new product on their side. Spirituality wants to make something spiritual out of it, and sensuality something sensual; the one wants to turn it into science or art, the other into sensual experience. The appropriation or dissolution of the mediatory product by either side is successful only if the ego is not completely divided but inclines more to one side or the other. But if one side succeeds in winning over and dissolving the mediatory product, the ego goes along with it, whereupon an identification of the ego with the most favoured function (v. *Inferior Function*) ensues. Consequently, the process of division will be repeated later on a higher plane.

由于无意识的活跃，现在就浮现出一种新的内容，其中正面和反面同等程度地聚集起来，相互处于补偿性联系中。因此这就形成了一个中间地带，在这个地带里对立双方可能得到和解。例如，如果我们设想这种对立是肉欲性对精神性，那么产生于无意识的调解的内容就会提供出适应于精神性正面的可随意受用的表达形式——凭借其丰富的精神性联想；同时也会提供出适应于肉欲性反面的可随意受用的表达形式——凭借其官能的想象。无论如何，处于正面和反面之间被扯裂的自我，在这个中间地带找到了它的对应物，找到了它唯一的表达方式，为了避免分裂，它迫不及待地抓住了这一表达方式。这样，对立的紧张所产生的能量就流入了用以调解的产物中，使它避免了冲突再次直接的爆发，因为对立双方都努力把新的产物拉向自己这一边。精神想从它这里获得某些精神性的东西，而肉欲则想获得某种肉感的东西；前者希望将它转化为科学和艺术，后者则希望将它转化为感官经验。只要自我尚未完全分裂而较为倾向于其中一方，这种用以调解的产物才能成功地被这一方所占用或者消解。但是，如果其中一方成功地赢得和消解了调解的产品，那么自我也将站到这一方去，于是自我对优势功能（参见“劣势功能”条）的认同作用就发生了。这将导致后来更高层次上的分裂过程的再度出现。

If, however, as a result of the stability of the ego, neither side succeeds in dissolving the mediatory product, this is sufficient demonstration that it is superior to both. The stability of the ego and the superiority of the mediatory product to both thesis and antithesis are to my mind correlates, each conditioning the other. Sometimes it seems as though the stability of the inborn *individuality* (q.v.) were the decisive factor, sometimes as though the mediatory product possessed a superior power that determines the ego’s absolute stability. In reality it may be that the stability of the one and the superior power of the other are two sides of the same coin.

然而，如果结果是自我坚定不变（并不投入任何一方），使任何一方都无法成功地消解用以调解的产物，那么这就充分证明了调解的产物比双方都更具优势。自我的稳固不变和调解的产物对对立双方的正面和反面所具有的优势，在我看来是互相关联和互为条件的。有时似乎天生的个性的稳固是决定性因素，而有时又好像调解的产物具有一种决定自我的绝对稳固性的优势力量。然而实际的情形可能是，个性的稳固和调解产物的优势力量是一体两面的。

If the mediatory product remains intact, it forms the raw material for a process not of dissolution but of construction, in which thesis and antithesis both play their part. In this way it becomes a new content that governs the whole attitude, putting an end to the division and forcing the energy of the opposites into a common channel. The standstill is overcome and life can flow on with renewed power towards new goals.

如果调解的产物仍然保持完整（即未被消解），那么它就会成为用于建构过程而并非用于消解过程的原始材料，正面和反面都在其中发挥各自的作用。在此过程中，它变成了一种统辖整体态度、结束分裂、迫使对立的能量进入共同的管道的新内容。生命的停滞被克服了，生命带着更生的力量朝向新的目标开始流动起来。

I have called this process in its totality the *transcendent function*, “function” being here understood not as a basic function but as a complex function made up of other functions, and “transcendent” not as denoting a metaphysical quality but merely the fact that this function facilitates a transition from one attitude to another. The raw material shaped by thesis and antithesis, and in the shaping of which the opposites are united, is the living symbol. Its profundity of meaning is inherent in the raw material itself, the very stuff of the psyche, transcending time and dissolution; and its configuration by the opposites ensures its sovereign power over all the psychic functions.

我从整体上把这个过程称为超越功能（transcendent function），这里我并不是指基本功能，而是把它当作由其他功能所组建的复合功能。“超越”并不意指任何形而上学的性质，而仅仅意指这样的事实，这种功能具有从一种态度过渡到另一种态度的能力。由正面和反面所形构的、并且在形构的过程中使对立双方得以和解的原始材料，正是有生命力的象征。其意义的深厚乃是内在于原始材料本身中的，乃是心理的真正本质，超越了时间与消解；由对立双方所产生的形构赋予了其超越所有心理功能的最高权力。

Indications of the process of symbol-formation are to be found in the scanty records of the conflicts experienced by the founders of religion during their initiation period, e.g., the struggle between Jesus and Satan, Buddha and Mara, Luther and the devil, Zwingli and his previous worldly life; or the regeneration of Faust through the pact with the devil. In *Zarathustra* we find an excellent example of the suppressed antithesis in the “Ugliest Man.”

象征形成过程的迹象，可以在宗教创立者活动的早期他们所体验到的内心冲突的零散纪录中去找到，例如，耶稣与撒旦、佛陀与玛拉（Mara），路德和恶魔、兹温格利与他先前的尘世生活之间的冲突；或者见于与魔鬼签订契约的浮士德的复活中。在《查拉图斯特拉如是说》中，我们在“最丑陋的人”身上发现了被压抑的反面的最佳例证。

## 52. 综合 (synthetic)

参见“建构”条。

## 53. 思维 (thinking)

This I regard as one of the four basic psychological *functions* (q.v.). Thinking is the psychological function which, following its own laws, brings the contents of ideation into conceptual connection with one another. It is an *apperceptive* (q.v.) activity, and as such may be divided into *active* and *passive* thinking. Active thinking is an act of the *will* (q.v.), passive thinking is a mere occurrence. In the former case, I submit the contents of ideation to a voluntary act of judgment; in the latter, conceptual connections establish themselves of their own accord, and judgments are formed that may even contradict my intention. They are not consonant with my aim and therefore, for me, lack any sense of direction, although I may afterwards recognize their directedness through an act of active apperception. Active thinking, accordingly, would correspond to my concept of *directed thinking*. Passive thinking was inadequately described in my previous work as “fantasy thinking.” Today I would call it *intuitive* thinking.

我把思维当作四种基本心理功能之一。思维是一种遵循它自身的规律的心理功能，用某种方式使观念的内容进入概念的联系中。它是一种统觉活动，由此，它可以被区分为主动的和被动的思维。主动思维是一种意志的行为，而被动思维是一种偶发现象。在前一种情况下，我服从于观念内容的自发的判断行为；在后一种情况下，概念的联系已根据其自身的规则建立起来了，判断的形成甚至与我的意图相矛盾。它们并不与我的目的相一致，所以在我看来，它们缺乏任何的方向感，尽管通过主动的统觉活动我可能后来认识到了这一点。因此，主动思维与我的定向思维的概念相一致。被动思维在我先前的著作中被不恰当地描述为“幻想的思维”。现在我称之为直觉的思维。

To my mind, a mere stringing together of ideas, such as is described by certain psychologists as *associative thinking*, is not thinking at all, but mere ideation. The term “thinking” should, in my view, be confined to the linking up of ideas by means of a concept, in other words, to an act of judgment, no matter whether this act is intentional or not.

在我看来，简单地把各种观念串连起来，诸如那种某些心理学家所描述的联想思维，它们毕竟不是思维，而只是观念作用。按照我的观点，“思维”这个术语被界定为通过概念把观念联结起来，亦即被界定为判断的行为，而无论该行为是否是意向性的。

The capacity for directed thinking I call *intellect*; the capacity for passive or undirected thinking I call *intellectual intuition*. Further, I call directed thinking a *rational* (q.v.) function, because it arranges the contents of ideation under concepts in accordance with a rational norm of which I am conscious. Undirected thinking is in my view an *irrational* (q.v.) function, because it arranges and judges the contents of ideation by norms of which I am not conscious and therefore cannot recognize as being in accord with reason. Subsequently I may be able to recognize that the intuitive act of judgment accorded with reason, although it came about in a way that appears to me irrational.

我把用于定向思维的能力称为理智的，而把用于被动的或非定向思维的能力称为理智的直觉。进一步说，我称定向思维为理性的功能，因为它用来处置观念作用内容的那些概念，与我所能意识到的理性规律是一致的。相反，在我看来，非定向思维是非理性的功能，因为它用来处置和判断观念作用内容的那些规则，是我所无法意识到的，因而也无法认识到它们是否与理性相一致。当然，我或许能够认识到判断的直觉行为也与理性相一致，虽然它是以一种在我看来非理性的方式出现的。

Thinking that is governed by *feeling* (q.v.) I do not regard as intuitive thinking, but as a thinking dependent on feeling; it does not follow its own logical principle but is subordinated to the principle of feeling. In such thinking the laws of logic are only ostensibly present; in reality they are suspended in favour of the aims of feeling.

我并不把被情感所控制的思维看作直觉的思维，而是看作依赖于情感的思维，它不遵从它自己的逻辑原则，而是从属于情感的原则。在这种思维中，逻辑律只是从表面上呈现出来；实际上为了迎合情感的目的它们被悬搁起来了。

### 53a.思想 (thought)

Thought is the specific content or material of the thinking function, discriminated by *thinking*(q.v.).

思想是思维功能的特殊内容或特殊材料，从思维可以得到辨析。

## 54. 超越功能 (transcendent funchtion)

参见“象征”条。

## 55. 类型 (type)

A type is a specimen or example which reproduces in a characteristic way the character of a species or class. In the narrower sense used in this particular work, a type is a characteristic specimen of a general *attitude* (q.v.) occurring in many individual forms. From a great number of existing or possible attitudes I have singled out four; those, namely, that are primarily oriented by the four basic psychological *functions* (q.v.): *thinking, feeling, sensation, intuition* (qq.v.). When any of these attitudes is *habitual*, thus setting a definite stamp on the character of an *individual* (q.v.), I speak of a psychological type. These *function-types*, which one can call the thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuitive types, may be divided into two classes according to the quality of the basic function, i.e., into the *rational* and the *irrational* (qq.v.). The thinking and feeling types belong to the former class, the sensation and intuitive types to the latter. A further division into two classes is permitted by the predominant trend of the movement of *libido* (q.v.), namely *introversion* and *extraversion* (qq.v.). All the basic types can belong equally well to one or the other of these classes, according to the predominance of the introverted or extraverted attitude. A thinking type may belong either to the introverted or to the extraverted class, and the same holds good for the other types. The distinction between rational and irrational types is simply another point of view and has nothing to do with introversion and extraversion.

类型是一种样式或范本，它以一种典型的方式再现某一个种类或类别的性格。在本书所使用的狭义中，类型是指出现在许多个体形式中的一般态度的典型模式。从大量存在的或可能存在的态度中，我挑选出四种态度，即主要定向于四种基本心理功能——思维、情感、直觉、感觉（参见诸条）——的态度。只要这些态度中的任何一种成为习惯性的，并因此而赋予个体性格以明确的印记，我就可以称其为心理类型。这些人们称作思维型、情感型、直觉型和感觉型的功能-类型，可根据基本功能的性质而分为两大类别，即理性的（参见诸条）和非理性的（参见诸条）。思维型和情感型属于前者，感觉型和直觉型属于后者。还可以进一步根据欲力（参见诸条）运动的优势倾向区分为内倾（参见诸条）和外倾（参见诸条）两类。根据内倾态度或外倾态度所具有的优势，所有基本类型都可归属于这两类中的任何一类。思维型既可以属于内倾型，又可以属于外倾型，这同样适用于其他的类型。理性和非理性类型的区分是另一方面的问题，它们与内倾和外倾没有关系。

In my previous contributions to typology I did not differentiate the thinking and feeling types from the introverted and extraverted types, but identified the thinking type with the introverted, and the feeling type with the extraverted. But a more thorough investigation of the material has shown me that we must treat the introverted and extraverted types as categories over and above the function-types. This differentiation, moreover, fully accords with experience, since, for example, there are undoubtedly two kinds of feeling types, the attitude of the one being oriented more by his feeling-experience \[= introverted feeling type\], the other more by the object \[= extraverted feeling type\].

在我先前关于类型理论的文稿中，我没有把思维型和情感型与内倾型和外倾型区分开来，而是把思维型与内倾型、情感型与外倾型等同起来了。但对资料更为深入的研究向我表明，我们必须把内倾型和外倾型当作高于功能类型的范畴。况且，这种区分与经验完全一致，例如，毫无疑问地存在两种情感类型，一种的态度更多地为他的情感-经验所定向（=内倾情感型），而另一种则更多地定向于客体（=外倾情感型）。

## 56. 无意识 (unconscious)

The concept of the *unconscious* is for me an *exclusively psychological* concept, and not a philosophical concept of a metaphysical nature. In my view the unconscious is a psychological borderline concept, which covers all psychic contents or processes that are not conscious, i.e., not related to the *ego* (q.v.) in any perceptible way. My justification for speaking of the existence of unconscious processes at all is derived simply and solely from experience, and in particular from psychopathological experience, where we have undoubted proof that, in a case of hysterical amnesia, for example, the ego knows nothing of the existence of numerous psychic complexes, and the next moment a simple hypnotic procedure is sufficient to bring the lost contents back to memory.

无意识概念对我来说是一个纯粹心理学的概念，而不是具有形而上学本质的哲学概念。根据我的观点，无意识是一个心理学的分界概念，它包括所有非意识的、亦即在任何可知觉的方式上与自我不相关的心理内容或心理过程。我有充分的理由证明无意识过程的存在，这种理由纯粹而唯一地来自经验，尤其来自于心理病理学的经验，在那里，我们能毫无疑问地证实，例如，在歇斯底里健忘症（hysterical amnesia）病例中，自我对大量心理情结的存在毫无所知，然而在另一时刻，一个简单的催眠步骤就足以使被遗忘的内容完全再现出来。

Thousands of such experiences justify us in speaking of the existence of unconscious psychic contents. As to the actual state an unconscious content is in when not attached to consciousness, this is something that eludes all possibility of cognition. It is therefore quite pointless to hazard conjectures about it. Conjectures linking up the unconscious state with cerebration and physiological processes belong equally to the realm of fantasy. It is also impossible to specify the range of the unconscious, i.e., what contents it embraces. Only experience can decide such questions.

数以千计的经验向我们证实了无意识心理内容的存在。就具体状况而言，当无意识内容与意识没有联系的时候，它就丧失了所有认识的可能性。所以，贸然地对它进行猜测完全是无意义的。通过大脑作用和心理过程将无意识状态联系起来的猜测同样属于幻想的领域。它也不可能详细说明无意识的范围，即无意识包含些什么内容。只有经验能够决定这些问题。

We know from experience that conscious contents can become unconscious through loss of their energic value. This is the normal process of “forgetting.” That these contents do not simply get lost below the threshold of consciousness we know from the experience that occasionally, under suitable conditions, they can emerge from their submersion decades later, for instance in dreams, or under hypnosis, or in the form of cryptomnesia, or through the revival of associations with the forgotten content. We also know that conscious contents can fall below the threshold of consciousness through “intentional forgetting,” or what Freud calls the *repression* of a painful content, with no appreciable loss of value. A similar effect is produced by a dissociation of the personality, i.e., the disintegration of consciousness as the result of a violent *affect* (q.v.) or nervous shock, or through the collapse of the personality in schizophrenia (Bleuler).

我们凭经验知道，意识内容通过其能量价值的丧失能够变成无意识的。这是正常的“遗忘”过程。那些并未简单地消失而是进入了意识的阈下的内容，我们也可从经验获知，有时在适当的条件下，它们能在沉潜数十年之后重新浮现出来，例如在梦中，或在催眠状态下，或以潜在记忆的形式，或通过复活对已遗忘的内容的联想而重新浮现出来。我们还知道，意识内容可能通过“有意的忘却”而沉入意识的阈限之下，这就是弗洛伊德称之为对痛苦内容的压抑的东西，它们的能量价值并没有太大的损失。类似的情形产生于人格的分裂即意识的崩溃，这乃是激烈的感情或神经震惊的结果，或者是精神分裂中由于人格解体所产生的结果（布留勒尔）。

We know from experience, too, that sense perceptions which, either because of their slight intensity or because of the deflection of attention, do not reach conscious *apperception* (q.v.), none the less become psychic contents through unconscious apperception, which again may be demonstrated by hypnosis, for example. The same thing may happen with certain judgments or other associations which remain unconscious because of their low energy charge or because of the deflection of attention. Finally, experience also teaches that there are unconscious psychic associations—mythological *images* (q.v.), for instance—which have never been the object of consciousness and must therefore be wholly the product of unconscious activity.

同样，我们从经验中知道，有些感官知觉因为其轻微的强度或因为注意的偏离而不能获得意识的统觉，但仍然可以通过无意识统觉而成为心理内容，例如催眠术就可再次证实这一点。对于某些由于其能量太小，或由于注意力的偏离而仍然遗留在无意识中的判断或其他的联想来说，同样的情形也会发生。最后，经验还告诉我们，有些无意识的心理联想——例如神话意象——它们从不能成为意识的对象，因而必然完全是无意识活动的产品。

To this extent, then, experience furnishes *points d’appui* for the assumption of unconscious contents. But it can tell us nothing about what might *possibly* be an unconscious content. It is idle to speculate about this, because the range of what *could* be an unconscious content is simply illimitable. What is the lowest limit of subliminal sense perception? Is there any way of measuring the scope and subtlety of unconscious associations? When is a forgotten content totally obliterated? To these questions there is no answer.

这样，在某种程度上，经验为我们关于无意识内容存在的假设提供了一个支点。但它不可能告诉我们某种无意识内容可能是什么。对此作出揣测是徒劳的，因为某种无意识内容可能是什么的范围简直是无限的广阔。阈下感官知觉的最低限度是什么呢？存在何种可测量无意识联想的广度和深度的方式呢？遗忘的内容何时能被完全消除呢？这些问题都还有待于回答。

Our experience so far of the nature of unconscious contents permits us, however, to make one general classification. We can distinguish a *personal unconscious*, comprising all the acquisitions of personal life, everything forgotten, repressed, subliminally perceived, thought, felt. But, in addition to these personal unconscious contents, there are other contents which do not originate in personal acquisitions but in the inherited possibility of psychic functioning in general, i.e., in the inherited structure of the brain. These are the mythological associations, the motifs and images that can spring up anew anytime anywhere, independently of historical tradition or migration. I call these contents the *collective unconscious*. Just as conscious contents are engaged in a definite activity, so too are the unconscious contents, as experience confirms. And just as conscious psychic activity creates certain products, so unconscious psychic activity produces dreams, *fantasies*(q.v.), etc. It is idle to speculate on how great a share consciousness has in dreams. A dream presents itself to us: we do not consciously create it. Conscious reproduction, or even the perception of it, certainly alters the dream in many ways, without, however, doing away with the basic fact of the unconscious source of creative activity.

无论如何，迄今为止我们对无意识内容的性质的经验只允许我们作出某种一般的分类。我们能区分出个体无意识，它包括所有个体生命的获得物——所有被遗忘的、被压抑的、下意识领悟到的、想到的和感受到的一切。除了这些个体无意识内容之外，还存在另一种无意识内容，它不是源于个人获得物，而是源于遗传的一般心理功能的可能性，即源于遗传的大脑结构。这就是神话联想、神话主题和神话意象，它们无需依赖于历史传统或移植就可能重新萌生于任何时代和任何地点。我把这些内容叫作集体无意识。正像意识内容从事于某种既定的活动一样，无意识内容——经验告诉我们——也从事着同样的活动。正像意识的心理活动创造出某种产品一样，无意识心理活动也创造出诸如梦、幻想之类的产品。要推测在梦中具有多少意识的成分那是徒劳的。梦呈现于我们：我们无法有意识地去创造它。有意识的再现甚或是对梦的知觉，都必定在很大程度上改变了梦，但也无论如何没有改变创造活动的无意识根源这一基本事实。

The functional relation of the unconscious processes to consciousness may be described as *compensatory* (q.v.), since experience shows that they bring to the surface the subliminal material that is constellated by the conscious situation, i.e., all those contents which could not be missing from the picture if everything were conscious. The compensatory function of the unconscious becomes more obvious the more one-sided the conscious *attitude* (q.v.) is; pathology furnishes numerous examples of this.

无意识过程与意识的功能联系可以描述为补偿性的，因为经验表明，它们使那些在意识状况下聚集起来的阈下材料浮现出来，即，使所有并未消失于心理图景中的内容都浮现出来，如果一切是意识的话。无意识的补偿性功能越是变得明显，意识的态度就越是片面化；病理学提供了大量这方面的例证。

## 57. 意志 (will)

I regard the will as the amount of psychic energy at the disposal of consciousness. Volition would, accordingly, be an energic process that is released by conscious motivation. A psychic process, therefore, that is conditioned by unconscious motivation I would not include under the concept of the will. The will is a psychological phenomenon that owes its existence to culture and moral education, but is largely lacking in the primitive mentality.

我把意志看作处于意识支配下相当数量的心理能量。据此概念，意志力是一个为意识动机所释放的能量的过程。所以，我没有把无意识动机所形成的心理过程包括在意志的概念里，意志是一种缘于文化和道德教育而存在的心理现象，而在原初心灵中是相当缺乏的。
