# EPILOGUE (结语)

In our age, which has seen the fruits of the French Revolution—“Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité”—growing into a broad social movement whose aim is not merely to raise or lower political rights to the same general level, but, more hopefully, to abolish unhappiness altogether by means of external regulations and egalitarian reforms—in such an age it is indeed a thankless task to speak of the complete inequality of the elements composing a nation. Although it is certainly a fine thing that every man should stand equal before the law, that every man should have his political vote, and that no man, through hereditary social position and privilege, should have unjust advantage over his brother, it is distinctly less fine when the idea of equality is extended to other walks of life. A man must have a very clouded vision, or view human society from a very misty distance, to cherish the notion that the uniform regulation of life would automatically ensure a uniform distribution of happiness. He must be pretty far gone in delusion if he imagines that equality of income, or equal opportunities for all, would have approximately the same value for everyone. But, if he were a legislator, what would he do about all those people whose greatest opportunities lie not without, but within? If he were just, he would have to give at least twice as much money to the one man as to the other, since to the one it means much, to the other little. No social legislation will ever be able to overcome the psychological differences between men, this most necessary factor for generating the vital energy of a human society. It may serve a useful purpose, therefore, to speak of the heterogeneity of men. These differences involve such different requirements for happiness that no legislation, however perfect, could afford them even approximate satisfaction. No outward form of life could be devised, however equitable and just it might appear, that would not involve injustice for one or the other human type. That, in spite of this, every kind of enthusiast—political, social, philosophical, or religious—is busily endeavouring to find those uniform external conditions which would bring with them greater opportunities for the happiness of all seems to me connected with a general attitude to life too exclusively oriented by the outer world.

我们这个时代，目睹了法国大革命所实现的“自由、平等、博爱”扩展成为一场更广泛的社会运动，其目标不仅把政治权利降低——也可以说是提高——到同样普遍的程度，而且更多地希望通过外部管理和平等主义的改革能够完全消除不幸——在这样的一个时代里，谈论一个国家的基本组成成分的完全不平等确实是一件费力不讨好的事情。法律面前人人平等，人人都有自己的政治选举权，无人能凭世袭的社会地位和特权欺压他的兄弟，尽管这一切都是美好的，但是，一旦当平等的概念延伸到其生命的领域时，一切就不再那么美好了。只有一个视野被完全遮蔽或从非常遥远的距离来看待人类社会的人，才会抱持这样的观点，认为对生命的齐一管制可以自然地确保幸福的平等分配。如果他真的认为收入的同等、机会的均衡对每一个人来说都具有同样的价值的话，那么他必定已经深陷欺妄之中了。但是，倘若他是一位立法者，他怎么对待所有那些其最大的机遇并非外在于生命而是内在于生命中的人呢？要如何对待那些生命的最大可能性不是外在而是内在的人呢？倘若他是公正的，他不得不给某人至少超出于另一个人两倍的金钱，因为对这个人来说他创造的更多，而另一个人则创造的较少。没有任何社会的立法能够克服人与人之间的心理差异，它是为人类社会提供生命能量的最必需的要素。因此，研究人类的这种异质性能服务于一种非常有价值的目的。这些差异包括诸如对幸福的不同要求，即使尽善尽美的立法也绝不可能大致满足这些要求。任何对生命形式的外在的设计，无论它显得多么的平等和公正，都不可能公正地对待人类不同的类型。尽管如此，各种热心家——政治的、社会的、哲学的和宗教的——仍然忙碌于努力寻找那些能为人类带来更大幸福机会的统一的外在条件，在我看来，所有这一切皆与唯一地定向于外部世界的生命的一般态度相关。

It is not possible to do more than touch on this far-reaching question here, since such considerations lie outside the scope of this book. We are here concerned only with the psychological problem, and the existence of different typical attitudes is a problem of the first order, not only for psychology but for all departments of science and life in which man’s psychology plays a decisive role. It is, for instance, obvious to anyone of ordinary intelligence that every philosophy that is not just a history of philosophy depends on a personal psychological premise. This premise may be of a purely individual nature, and indeed is generally regarded as such if any psychological criticism is made at all. The matter is then considered settled. But this is to overlook the fact that what one regards as an individual prejudice is by no means so under all circumstances, since the standpoint of a particular philosopher often has a considerable following. It is acceptable to his followers not because they echo him without thinking, but because it is something they can fully understand and appreciate. Such an understanding would be impossible if the philosopher’s standpoint were determined only individually, for it is quite certain in that case that he would be neither fully understood nor even tolerated. The peculiarity of the standpoint which is understood and acknowledged by his followers must therefore correspond to a *typical* personal attitude, which in the same or a similar form has many representatives in a society. As a rule, the partisans of either side attack each other purely externally, always seeking out the chinks in their opponent’s armour. Squabbles of this kind are usually fruitless. It would be of considerably greater value if the dispute were transferred to the psychological realm, from which it arose in the first place. The shift of position would soon show a diversity of psychological attitudes, each with its own right to existence, and each contributing to the setting up of incompatible theories. So long as one tries to settle the dispute by external compromises, one merely satisfies the modest demands of shallow minds that have never yet been enkindled by the passion of a principle. A real understanding can, in my view, be reached only when the diversity of psychological premises is accepted.

这里，我不可能更深地触及这个深远的问题，因为这种思考已超出了本书的范围。我在这里仅仅涉及到心理的问题，而不同类型态度的存在是一个首要问题，这不仅对于心理学，对于凡是人类心理在其中扮演了决定性角色的各个科学分支和生活的领域莫不如此。例如，一个对普通智慧来说最明白不过的事实是，哲学不单是哲学史，它也依赖于个体心理这个前提条件。这一前提条件可能是纯粹的个人天性，它也确实被普遍认为是如此，如果要作出最终的心理评价的话。由于它总是被当作理所当然的事，所以我们就忽视了这样的事实，某人视为个人偏见的东西绝非在任何情况下都是如此，因为一位独特的哲学家的观点常常有一大批的追随者。他的观点之所以为这些人所接受，并不是因为他们不假思索地附和他，而是因为他们完全能够理解和赏识他的观点。如果哲学家的观点仅仅属于他自己，那么这种理解就是完全不可能的，因为相当明显，在这种情况下，他不仅不能被理解，甚至会令人难以忍受。因此，为追随者们所理解和赏识的这种观点的独特性，必定与某种类型的态度相一致，它在社会中可以找到许多相同的或类似的代表。通常，每一方的支持者仅仅从外部攻击另一方，总想从对手的论点中找出其弱点来。这种争辩往往毫无结果。倘若将争辩移植到心理学的领域，就会具有更大的意义，因为问题首先肇源于此。观点的转换将很快显示出：存在种种不同的心理态度，其中每一种都有存在的权利，每一种特质都设立了各种互不相容的理论。只要人们试图从外部调和来解决争端，那么人们就只能满足于那些肤浅的心灵的要求，而从未能被原则的热情之火所点燃。在我看来，要达到彼此的真正理解，只有当作为心理前提条件的异质性被接受时方有可能。

It is a fact, which is constantly and overwhelmingly apparent in my practical work, that people are virtually incapable of understanding and accepting any point of view other than their own. In small things a general superficiality of outlook, combined with a none too common forbearance and tolerance and an equally rare goodwill, may help to build a bridge over the chasm which lack of understanding opens between man and man. But in more important matters, and especially those concerned with ideals, an understanding seems, as a rule, to be beyond the bounds of possibility. Certainly strife and misunderstanding will always be among the props of the tragicomedy of human existence, but it is none the less undeniable that the advance of civilization has led from the law of the jungle to the establishment of courts of justice and standards of right and wrong which are above the contending parties. It is my conviction that a basis for the settlement of conflicting views would be found in the recognition of different types of attitude—a recognition not only of the existence of such types, but also of the fact that every man is so imprisoned in his type that he is simply incapable of fully understanding another standpoint. Failing a recognition of this exacting demand, a violation of the other standpoint is practically inevitable. But just as the contending parties in a court of law refrain from direct violence and submit their claims to the justice of the law and the impartiality of the judge, so each type, conscious of his own partiality, should refrain from heaping abuse, suspicion, and indignity upon his opponent.

实际上，人们除了他自己之外，对任何别人的观点都几乎很难理解和接受，这一事实不断地大量出现在我的实际研究中。在一些不起眼的小事中，一种相当表层的展望，与一种并不经常出现的迁就和忍让以及一种相当少见的亲善相结合，都有助于在人与人之间所明显缺失的理解的鸿沟上架起一座桥梁。但是，在重大的事件中，尤其那些涉及理想的事件，理解似乎往往变得完全没有可能。确实，冲突和误解总是出现在人类存在的悲-喜剧中，但仍然不可否认，人类文明的发展，早已由丛林法则（law of the jungle）走向了超越论争各方之上的法庭和是非标准的建立。我深信平息相冲突的观点的基础，能在对于不同的态度类型的认识中发现——不仅要认识这些类型的存在，而且要认识到每个人都是如此地受制于他自己的类型，以致几乎无法再去完全理解别人的观点。倘若无法认识到这一确切的需要，那么对他人观点的侵犯就必然不可避免。但是，正如争执的各方在法庭中必须禁止直接的暴力，而向公正的法律和无偏袒的法官陈述自己的主张一样，每一个意识到自己类型的偏见的人，也同样必须禁止将肆意的谩骂、猜疑和侮辱强加于对方。

In considering the problem of typical attitudes, and in presenting them in outline, I have endeavoured to direct the eye of my readers to this picture of the many possible ways of viewing life, in the hope that I may have contributed my small share to the knowledge of the almost infinite variations and gradations of individual psychology. No one, I trust, will draw the conclusion from my description of types that I believe the four or eight types here presented to be the only ones that exist. This would be a serious misconception, for I have no doubt whatever that these attitudes could also be considered and classified from other points of view. Indeed, there are indications of such possibilities in this book, as for instance Jordan’s classification in terms of activity. But whatever the criterion for a classification of types may be, a comparison of the various forms of habitual attitudes will result in an equal number of psychological types.

通过对于类型态度问题的思考和概要的描述，我渴望引导读者去审视这幅观察生命的多种可能性的图画，希望我能为认识几乎难以确定的个体心理的多样性及其多层性贡献自己一份微薄的力量。我相信没有一个人将从我对类型的描述中得出这样的结论，认为我在这里所呈现的四种或八种类型是唯一可能存在的类型。那将是一个严重的误解，因为我一点也不怀疑这几种态度也可以从其他的观点来考虑和分类。事实上，本书已经指出了这种可能性，例如乔丹根据好动与否所作的分类。但是，无论用于类型分类的标准是什么，对各种不同习惯性态度形成的比较将导致同等数量的心理类型的诞生。

However easy it may be to regard the existing attitudes from other viewpoints than the one here adopted, it would be difficult to adduce evidence against the existence of psychological types. I have no doubt at all that my opponents will be at some pains to strike the question of types off the scientific agenda, since the type problem must, to say the least of it, be a very unwelcome obstacle for every theory of complex psychic processes that lays claim to general validity. Every theory of complex psychic processes presupposes a uniform human psychology, just as scientific theories in general presuppose that nature is fundamentally one and the same. But in the case of psychology there is the peculiar condition that, in the making of its theories, the psychic process is not merely an object but at the same time the subject. Now if one assumes that the subject is the same in all individual cases, it can also be assumed that the subjective process of theory-making, too, is the same everywhere. That this is not so, however, is demonstrated most impressively by the existence of the most diverse theories about the nature of complex psychic processes. Naturally, every new theory is ready to assume that all other theories were wrong, usually for the sole reason that its author has a different subjective view from his predecessors. He does not realize that the psychology he sees is *his* psychology, and on top of that is the psychology of his type. He therefore supposes that there can be only one true explanation of the psychic process he is investigating, namely the one that agrees with his type. All other views—I might almost say all seven other views—which, in their way, are just as true as his, are for him mere aberrations. In the interests of the validity of his own theory, therefore, he will feel a lively but very understandable distaste for any view that establishes the existence of different types of human psychology, since his own view would then lose, shall we say, seven-eighths of its truth. For, besides his own theory, he would have to regard seven other theories of the same process as equally true, or, if that is saying too much, at least grant a second theory a value equal to his own.

无论如何，从其他的观点而不是从这里所采用的观点来思考存在的态度是比较容易的，但要提出证据来反对心理类型的存在却很困难。我毫不怀疑，我的论敌会竭尽全力将类型问题剔出科学的研究范围，因为对于每一种自称具有普遍有效性的复杂的心理过程理论来说，类型问题必定或至少是一个极为不受欢迎的障碍。正如一般的科学理论预设自然基本上是同一的一样，各种关于复杂心理过程的理论也预设了人类心理的一致性。但是，心理学领域有它的特殊状况，即在形成-理论时，心理过程并不仅仅是客体，而且同时也是主体。因此，如果人们假设主体在所有个案中都是同一的，那么也就设定了形成-理论的主观过程无论哪里都是同一的。然而事实并非如此，形形色色、千差万别的关于复杂心理过程本质的理论的存在最为生动地证实了这一点。自然，一种新的理论总是最终设想其他理论是错误的，这通常只是由于作者有一个不同于他的前辈的主观观点的缘故。他并没有认识到，他所看见的心理只是他自己的心理，充其量只是他所属类型的心理。所以他会推断，对于他所观察到的心理过程仅仅存在一种真实的解释，即那种符合他所属类型的解释。所有其他的观点——我几乎可以说所有其他的七种观点——就他们的类型而言，虽在也一样的真实，但在他看来却纯属谬误。所以，为了维护他自己理论的有效性，他对任何关于人类心理不同类型存在理论的建立感到一种强烈的、但却是可以理解的反感，因为他的观点可以说将会因此丧失八分之七的真理价值。因为除了他自己的理论，他还必须把另外七种关于同一过程的理论看作是同等真实的，或者，如果要说得更充分些的话，至少把它们当作与他的理论具有同等价值的第二种理论。

I am quite convinced that a natural process which is very largely independent of human psychology, and can therefore be viewed only as an object, can have but one true explanation. But I am equally convinced that the explanation of a complex psychic process which cannot be objectively registered by any apparatus must necessarily be only the one which that subjective process itself produces. In other words, the author of the concept can produce only just such a concept as corresponds to the psychic process he is endeavouring to explain; but it will correspond only when the process to be explained coincides with the process occurring in the author himself. If neither the process to be explained, nor any analogy of it, were to be found in the author, he would be confronted with a complete enigma, whose explanation he would have to leave to the man who himself experienced the process. If I have a vision, for instance, no objectively registering apparatus will enable me to discover how it originated; I can explain its origin only as I myself understand it. But in this “as I myself understand it” lies the partiality, for at best my explanation will start from the way the visionary process presents itself to me. By what right do I assume that the visionary process presents itself in the same or a similar way to everyone?

我固然相信，一种在很大程度上独立于人的心理因此而只能被看作客体的自然过程只可能具有一种真正的解释。但我也同样地坚信，对一种无法为任何器械所客观记录的复杂心理过程的解释，必定是进行解释的那个主观过程的产物。换句话说，概念的制造者只能产生与他努力从事解释的心理过程相应的概念；但是，只有当被解释的过程与发生在概念制造者本身中的过程相一致时，才可能有这种相应产生。倘若被解释的过程在概念制造者本人那里并不存在，又无任何相类似的过程出现，那么他将面临一个十足的哑谜，他只能将他的解释留给一个亲身经历这一过程的人去做。例如，如果我产生了一个幻觉，没有任何客观记录的器械能使我发现它是怎样出现的；那么，只有当我自己理解了它时我才能解释它的起因。但是，在这一“当我自己理解了它时”之中便存在着偏见，因为我最多只能就幻觉过程呈现于我本人的方式来做出解释。我有什么权利假设幻觉过程会以完全相同的或近似的方式呈现于每一人呢？

With some show of reason, one will adduce the uniformity of human psychology at all times and places as an argument in favour of this generalization of a subjective judgment. I myself am so profoundly convinced of the uniformity of the psyche that I have even summed it up in the concept of the collective unconscious, as a universal and homogeneous substratum whose uniformity is such that one finds the same myth and fairytale motifs in all corners of the earth, with the result that an uneducated American Negro dreams of motifs from Greek mythology and a Swiss clerk re-experiences in his psychosis the vision of an Egyptian Gnostic. But this fundamental homogeneity is offset by an equally great heterogeneity of the conscious psyche. What immeasurable distances lie between the consciousness of a primitive, a Periclean Athenian, and a modern European! What a difference even between the consciousness of a learned professor and that of his spousel What, in any case, would our world be like if there existed a uniformity of minds? No, the notion of a uniformity of the conscious psyche is an academic chimera, doubtless simplifying the task of a university lecturer when facing his pupils, but collapsing into nothing in the face of reality. Quite apart from the differences among individuals whose innermost natures are separated by stellar distances, the types, as classes of individuals, are themselves to a very large extent different from one another, and it is to the existence of these types that we must ascribe the differences of views in general.

基于某种理由，人们提出所有时空下人类心理的同一性来作为支撑这种主观判断的普遍性的论据。我本人对人类心理的同一性也如此地坚信不疑，以致甚至将其归结为集体无意识的概念，归结为一种普遍的和同质的基质，其同一性是如此的一再见于世界各地同样的神话主题和民间故事的主题中，因此，一个未受教育的美国黑人会梦见来自希腊神话的主题，一个瑞士的店员处于精神病状态下会重新体验埃及诺斯替教徒的幻觉。但是，这种基本的同质性却为一种同样巨大的意识心理的异质性所抵消。在原初人、培里克里斯时代的雅典人的意识与现代欧洲人的意识之间存在多么巨大的差别！学识渊博的教授与他的配偶之间的意识又是多么明显的不同！总之，倘若存在着心灵的同一性的话，那么我们今天的世界将会怎样呢？然而情况绝非如此，意识心灵的同一性这个概念纯属学院派的妄想，毫无疑问，这使大学讲师面对学生时他的讲授变得十分简单，但在现实面前却实在是不堪一击。除了个体最内在的本性之间存在何啻天壤之别的巨大差异外，作为个体类别的类型本身又在很大程度上彼此相去甚远，而我们所描述的一般观点的差异正是源于这些类型的存在。

In order to discover the uniformity of the human psyche, I have to descend into the very foundations of consciousness. Only there do I find that in which all are alike. If I build my theory on what is common to all, I explain the psyche in terms of its foundation and origin. But that does nothing to explain its historical and individual differentiation. With such a theory I ignore the peculiarities of the conscious psyche. I actually deny the whole other side of the psyche, its differentiation from the original germinal state. I reduce man to his phylogenetic prototype, or I dissolve him into his elementary processes; and when I try to reconstruct him again, in the former case an ape will emerge, and in the latter a welter of elementary processes engaged in aimless and meaningless reciprocal activity.

为了发现人类心理的同一性，我必须深入到意识的根基中去。只有在那里我才发现所有的心理现象都是相似的。如果我把理论建立在所有人的共同性上，那么我就必须根据心理的根基和源始来进行解释。但是，这样做时仅仅解释了其历史的和个体的差异。由此理论，我忽视了意识心理的特殊性。我实际上否定了全部心理的另一面，即它从原初胚胎状态以来的分化。我不是把人还原到种系发生的原型（phylogenetic prototype），就是把人分解成他的基本过程；当我试图将他进行重构时，在前一种情况下将出现一个类人猿，而在后一种情况下，则将出现一大堆既无目的又无意义地忙碌于相互活动的基本过程。

No doubt an explanation of the psyche on the basis of its uniformity is not only possible but fully justified. But if I want to project a picture of the psyche in its totality, I must bear in mind the diversity of psyches, since the conscious individual psyche belongs just as much to a general picture of psychology as does its unconscious foundation. In my construction of theories, therefore, I can, with as much right, proceed from the fact of differentiated psyches, and consider the same process from the standpoint of differentiation which I considered before from the standpoint of uniformity. This naturally leads me to a view diametrically opposed to the former one. Everything which in that view was left out of the picture as an individual variant now becomes important as a starting-point for further differentiations; and everything which previously had a special value on account of its uniformity now appears valueless, because merely collective. From this angle I shall always be intent on where a thing is going to, not where it comes from; whereas from the former angle I never bothered about the goal but only about the origin. I can, therefore, explain the same psychic process with two contradictory and mutually exclusive theories, neither of which I can declare to be wrong, since the rightness of one is proved by the uniformity of the psyche, and the rightness of the other by its diversity.

毫无疑问，建立在同一性基础上的心理解释不但是可能的，而且是完全正当的。但如果我想投射出心理图像的全貌来，那么我必须记住心理差异这个事实，因为意识的个体心理既具有一般的心理图像，也具有它的无意识基础的图像。因此在我的理论建构中，我完全有理由从不同的心理这个事实出发来思考同一个过程，这个过程我先前是从同一性的角度加以考虑的，而现在则从不同的个体心理的角度来看待。这自然把我引向了与前述看法根本相反的观点。在前述观点中所有被当作个性的变异而出脱于整体图像的东西，在这里都作为适应于进一步分化的起点而变得十分重要；在前述观点中所有根据其同一性而被赋予特殊价值的东西，现在都显得毫无价值了，因为它们仅仅是集体的。从此角度，我将一直关注事物将向何处发展，而并非它从何而来；但从前述观点的角度来看，我绝不会去考虑它的目的，而只会考虑它的起源。因此，我能通过两种相矛盾的和相互排斥的理论来解释同一个心理过程，我并不宣称两者中的任何一种是错误的，因为其一种的正确性为心理的同一性所证明，而另一种的正确性则为心理的多样性所证实。

This brings us to the great difficulty which the reading of my earlier book only aggravated, both for the scientific public and for the layman, with the result that many otherwise competent heads were thrown into confusion. There I made an attempt to present both views with the help of case material. But since reality neither consists of theories nor follows them, the two views, which we are bound to think of as divided, are united within it. Each is a product of the past and carries a future meaning, and of neither can it be said with certainty whether it is an end or a beginning. Everything that is alive in the psyche shimmers in rainbow hues. For anyone who thinks there is only one true explanation of a psychic process, this vitality of psychic contents, which necessitates two contradictory theories, is a matter for despair, especially if he is enamoured of simple and uncomplicated truths, incapable maybe of thinking both at the same time.

这对阅读过我的早期著作（《转变的象征》）的一般大众和科学界的人来说造成了极大的困难，以致使许多能独立思考的人都深感困惑。因为在那里，我企图借助于个案材料来同时描述这两种观点。但既然现实既不由理论所构成又不依循于理论，那么这两种我们必定认为是相互背离的观点，其实在现实中是相一致的。它们都是过去的产物，并且携带着未来的意义，其任何一种都不能被确定地认为是终点还是始点。所有心理中有生命的东西无不像彩虹般闪烁着各种色调。对任何认为心理过程只存在一种真实的解释的人来说，如此充满活力的心理内容——它们需要两种相互矛盾的理论——是令人绝望的事实，尤其当他欣赏简单而不复杂的真理时，他是完全无法同时思考这两种观点的。

On the other hand, I am not convinced that, with these two ways of looking at the psyche—the reductive and constructive as I have called them—the possibilities of explanation are exhausted. I believe that other equally “true” explanations of the psychic process can still be put forward, just as many in fact as there are types. Moreover, these explanations will agree as well or as ill with one another as the types themselves in their personal relations. Should, therefore, the existence of typical differences of human psyches be granted—and I confess I see no reason why it should not be granted—the scientific theorist is confronted with the disagreeable dilemma of either allowing several contradictory theories of the same process to exist side by side, or of making an attempt, foredoomed at the outset, to found a sect which claims for itself the only correct method and the only true theory. Not only does the former possibility encounter the extraordinary difficulty of an inwardly contradictory “double-think” operation, it also contravenes one of the first principles of intellectual morality: *principia explicandi non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem*. But in the case of psychological theories the necessity of a plurality of explanations is given from the start, since, in contrast to any other scientific theory, the object of psychological explanation is consubstantial with the subject: one psychological process has to explain another. This serious difficulty has already driven thoughtful persons to remarkable subterfuges, such as the assumption of an “objective intellect” standing outside the psychic process and capable of contemplating the subordinate psyche objectively, or the similar assumption that the intellect is a faculty which can stand outside itself and contemplate itself. All these expedients are supposed to create a sort of extra-terrestrial Archimedean point by means of which the intellect can lift itself off its own hinges. I understand very well the profound human need for convenient solutions, but I do not see why truth should bow to this need. I can also understand that, aesthetically, it would be far more satisfactory if, instead of the paradox of mutually contradictory explanations, we could reduce the psychic process to the simplest possible instinctive foundation and leave it at that, or if we could credit it with a metaphysical goal of redemption and find peace in that hope.

另一方面，我并不相信，凭借这两种思考心理的方法——我称之为还原的和建构的方法——其解释的可能性就已完全穷尽了。相反，我认为仍然能够提出其他的对心理过程同样“真实”的解释来，事实上，有多少种类型就会有多少种解释。而且，这些解释彼此之间可能保持一致也可能相互格，正如不同类型在其个人关系上的情形。因此，人类心理中类型差异的存在应该得到承认——坦率地说，我看不出有什么理由不承认它的存在——科学理论家面临这样使人难堪的困境：要么允许多种关于同一心理过程的相互矛盾的理论同时存在，要么就得去努力建立——从一开始就命定如此——一个自称具有唯一正确的方法和唯一真理的宗派。前一种可能性不仅明显遇到了内在矛盾的“双重-思考”（即同时保持相互矛盾的见解）的困境，而且也违反了心智伦理的第一原则：解释原则的增加不能超过所必需的数目。然而，在心理学理论的情形中，对解释的多样性的需要从一开始就是既定的，因为与任何其他的自然科学理论相比较，心理学解释的对象与主体具有同样的性质：必得以一种心理过程去解释另一种心理过程。这一艰难的困境已经驱使一些思想者走向明显的诡辩，诸如假设一种超出心理过程之外而能客观地沉思其所属心理的“客观理性”的存在，或者同样地假设，理性具有一种能够站在自身之外来沉思自身的能力。所有这些预设的权宜之计都在于创造一个阿基米德式的地球以外的杠杆支点，理性借此支点能把自己举到自身之外去。我非常理解具有深度的人们需要方便的解决之道，但是我却不能明白为什么真理必须屈从于这种需要。我也能够理解，如果我们放弃那些吊诡而相互矛盾的解释，把心理过程尽可能地还原为最简单的本能基础，让它停留在哪里，或者赋予它以救赎的形而上学的目的，使它在这种希望中找到宁静，那么从审美的角度来看，这要更令人满意一些。

Whatever we strive to fathom with our intellect will end in paradox and relativity, if it be honest work and not *a petitio principii* in the interests of convenience. That an intellectual understanding of the psychic process must end in paradox and relativity is simply unavoidable, if only for the reason that the intellect is but one of many psychic functions which is intended by nature to serve man in constructing of his images of the objective world. We should not pretend to understand the world only by the intellect; we apprehend it just as much by feeling. Therefore the judgment of the intellect is, at best, only a half-truth, and must, if it is honest, also admit its inadequacy.

无论我们竭尽全力地用我们的理性去探索什么，如果这确是一件诚实的工作而并非服务于便利的预期理由（petitio principii）的话，那么都将会以吊诡和相对性告终。对心理过程的理性理解必然终结于吊诡和相对性，这简直是无法避免的事，因为理性只是众多心理功能中的一种，它们究其实质在于帮助人类去建构其关于客观世界的意象。我们不可能佯装仅仅通过理性就理解了世界；我们同样必须通过情感去感悟世界。因此，理性判断最好也不过是真理的一半，倘若它是真实的，也会承认自己的不足。

To deny the existence of types is of little avail in the face of the facts. In view of their existence, therefore, every theory of psychic processes has to submit to being evaluated in its turn as itself a psychic process, as the expression of a specific type of human psychology with its own justification. Only from these typical self-representations of the psyche can the materials be collected which will co-operate to form a higher synthesis.

面对类型存在的事实，要否认它们几乎是不可能的。因此，考虑到它们的存在，每一种关于心理过程的理论都必须将其当作一种心理过程，或者当作一种具有自身合理性的对于人类心理的特殊类型的表达方式而依次给予具有一定价值的评价。只有从这些心理类型的自发-呈现中，才能聚集起相关的材料，它们的相互运作将形成一种更高的综合。

## 译后记

译完全书的最后一个单词，我感到一种全所未有的轻松，就像心头搬去了一块沉重的石头似的。我终于可以说，我不会愧对读者了，也不会愧对天才的思想家荣格先生了。回想起来，这是一本翻译了二十年的书，80年代末，那是一个思想解放且充溢激情的年代，不像现在似的我们的头脑中除了“金钱”便别无他物。我从学校图书馆找到这本荣格的《心理类型》，便与几个研究生学友近乎拼命地翻译起来。译文自然存在种种缺陷，但偏有华岳文艺社的任平兄颇加青睐，将之付梓出版了，还纳入名为“世界文化艺术译丛”的丛书，可以想见当时译者的野心和编者的魄力。但出书之后，心中总感十分不安，总觉得这件事情没有做完也未做好，心里沉甸甸的。至90年代中期，不料台湾的桂冠图书公司要求出版拙译的繁体字版。当然我仍然感到喜出望外。或许桂冠公司觉得译本颇有缺陷，即请臧声远、余伯泉、刘宏信三位心理学教授做了全面的校阅，确实给拙译增色不少。余伯泉先生还与我有很好的交流。但该译本主要限于海外发行，广大内地读者很难见到。直到今年，北京“爱知堂”的崔正山先生几经周折找到了我，说与上海三联书店携手再次出版该书。我便只得捡拾起二十年前的旧译，也以桂冠版作为借鉴开始重译，发现两个版本仍然问题不少，连贯起来难以卒读，加之台湾学界名词术语及表述方式的差异，都使我觉得有完全重译该书的必要。这样我几乎逐字逐句地重新翻译了荣格的这部经典名作，其间因劳累过度还大病了两场，终于将一个全新的版本推出来了。虽然历尽艰辛，但仍然觉得十分惬意，了却了二十年来的一桩心事。

译毕之余，深感世界学术名著汉译的艰难。荣格的这部代表作涉及到西方哲学、文学、宗教等领域的主要代表人物及著作，诸如康德、席勒、歌德、尼采等思想大师，翻译中我也参见比照了关于他们作品的汉译本，其中不乏名家名译，但是问题仍然不少，有些甚至难以卒读，使读者无法接近。因此要想真正理解这些思想大师，我们或许仍然需要一个广泛的重译运动。我们要深悉西方文化，首先要能理解西方文化，而理解西方文化很大程度上必须借助译本。这是一项无法回避的任务，我们必须沉下心来付出艰辛的努力。就对荣格的接受而言，从该书附录的有关他的20卷全集目录可以看到，他的著述是多么的丰富，而我们的汉译才寥寥几种，两者相较太不相称了，且他的主要作品都没有译介过来。这样怎么可能谈得上了解荣格呢？时下流行的不过对他的一些名词术语的搬用而已，甚至有生吞活剥之感。因此余伯泉先生曾十分感慨地说，“荣格作品还远未过时，甚至都未曾真正进入中文世界”。这在我是颇有同感的。这也可以见出《心理类型》出版的价值与意义，但愿能起到筚路蓝缕的作用。

关于本书在荣格思想中的地位和意义，我已在“译序”中论及，虽然是二十年前所写，但还是大致体现了该书的大致情况，台湾桂冠本也保留了此译序，可见仍然具有一定的参考作用，尽管其局限明显可见。现在在我看来，译序中对荣格在西方甚至世界思想史中的地位尚未明确肯定。这使我想起具有世纪转折意义的另一位思想家海德格尔，他与荣格同属一个时代。他的划时代名作《存在与时间》出版于1927年，而荣格的《心理类型》出版于1921年，这并非纯属巧合，而是一种世界性的思想潮流所致。就其倾向而言，他们都超越形而上学而向前回溯，海德格尔回溯到了古希腊的苏格拉底以前的哲学，在那里找到了他存在的根基，而荣格则回溯到基督教以前的异教——诺斯替教——和古希腊神话，并由此而进入古印度的婆罗门教及中国的道教，在那里找到了人类心理未分化、未片面化以前的存在状况。这样的回溯使他们具有了共同的思想倾向，他们都以康德、叔本华、尼采作为其思想先驱，而与占据统治地位的形而上学形成尖锐对立，且意在从整体上颠覆它。海德格尔的“存在”究其实质是对个体原本的生存状况的展示，他称之为“此在”的在世生存，从而消解了历来的思维模式主-客体之间的对置；荣格的出发点则是“类型”，类型是着眼于个体生存的心理模式，虽然他主要阐释了八种心理类型，但他一再强调真实的状况要远为复杂得多。这无异是说个体的心理存在状况是极为千差万别的。因此，两位思想家都不约而同地将他们的思想确立在个体及其存在方式上。由此海德格尔筹建了他的生存论结构，并又重复引入时间性线索将此在的生存论结构落到实处，构建起此在的整体生存框架。荣格则对个体心理的多样性做了充分的展示，将其归结为内倾和外倾两种生存态度，这很类似于海氏的此在之“在世”，外倾相应于海氏的“世界化”或“世界性”，而内倾则相应于作为此在基本现身情态的“畏”或回归自身的“良知”“决心”，他称之为本真的生存。因此在这个意义上，荣格的“客体”应该理解为“世界”（虽然在这里他仍然更多地受制于主-客体对置的思维框架）。这样我们看到，荣格从此所展示的八种心理功能类型是对海德格尔此在存在状况从心理层面的进一步揭示或补充。由于时间性和历史性概念的引入，此在生存并非是孤立的，而是建基于时间性-历史性中的，也就是说是承续曾在朝向将来的，这样他不得不确立了“先行的”先验概念，即此在必得“先行视见”“先行具有”“先行掌握”地去生存。这是对康德先验概念的继承，也将之落在了生存的实处。荣格同样如此，由个体心理的多样性他必然走向其多样性的根源，即集体性，而集体性总是一个时间-历史的过程，因而具有古老的或古代的特征。这就使荣格的思路从个体心理类型-个体无意识走向了个体心理的时间-历史过程，即集体无意识。这才是荣格思想最核心的部分或基质。

在这一点上荣格远远超越了海德格尔，使海氏的“三先”落到了坚实的心理层面，落到了集体无意识的深广内涵中。正是在这里，荣格能将西方宗教史——尤其是前基督教史——异教史以至古老神话、传奇故事连接起来，因而能够将东方古老宗教及其相关学说连接起来，从而涉及到与之密切关联的诗与文学，因为诗与文学是其最恰当的载体。这正与后期的海德格尔对诗的皈依——尤其是荷尔德林的诗歌——殊途同归，因为他们所要追寻的是此在生存的意义，这意义在荣格看来必在于对集体无意识的探寻，在海德格尔则是对精神的家园的皈依。在荣格的集体无意识中所展示的远非是人类文化知之甚少的一系列神秘领域的拓展，且更是对人的生命存在自远古至今的一种寻根问底，似乎远比海氏的追问要深邃得多。于是荣格从“自身”问及了个体生命存在的母体的“灵魂”，男性的“阿尼玛”和女性的“阿尼姆斯”，问及了作为其镜像的“灵魂意象”，也就是灵魂具体化或其所投射的人格化身。它们都无一例外地存在于梦、幻觉（灵视）、诗、文学、神话、民间传说、宗教经典甚至哲学文献中，以一种独特的方式出现，这就是荣格所称道的“象征”。

荣格赋予了象征一词丰富的含义，象征是唯一表达灵魂或灵魂意象的形象，也是其唯一的方式，其实质是无意识的非理性的，理性的思维所难以达及的，是人类最佳的生命存在状况，失去象征的生存是片面的病态的生存，因而现代人必须找寻和再度拥有它。而象征的表达方式只能是直觉的感觉的综合，其中也包含思维与情感，诸如柏拉图、黑格尔理式或理念之类观念不过是对其所作的理性程式化表述罢了。这就是象征的意义，它潜在于集体无意识或原型中，要想获得它全赖于阐释，阐释必须依赖于人类四种基本功能的综合运用，理性的逻辑的思维无济于事，只能粗暴地对待它，或者将它推入人性分裂的深渊。这里荣格一定程度上否定了西方占据统治地位的形而上学，引导了非理性主义的历史潮流，但也肯定了理性思维与情感的合理性，因为无论怎样，象征必须上升到意识的层面才具有生命的可能性，而这必须借助理性才行。这正是荣格“和解象征”的意义，人类心理究其实质在于内倾与外倾两种态度的分裂与冲突，象征是其对立的唯一的调解者。正是在这里，荣格给予了“阐释”——或者说“解释”“理解”——以深刻的含义，它们并非是认识论意义上的，而是对象征意义的获取，是以提高和增进生命的意义与目的为前提的，是人对自古以来的存在状况的洞见，很类似于海德格尔的存在之思，由“畏”而导致的生存“决断”，即“良知”的获取和向死而在的生存把握。这样，后来的伽达默尔继此而滋生出来的对人的生存境遇的诠释学理解就自然应运而生了。

荣格把对象征的阐释归结为建构的方法，它一方面要消解意识与无意识的内在对立，另一方面则要建构起新的生存模式，寻求人的生命力——欲力——流向未来的和谐度和可能性。因此建构的方法以引导生命朝向未来为目的，为唯一的定向。这也正与海氏此在的生存以将来的到时为根本取向的思想相吻合。在这里，荣格否定了弗洛伊德、阿德勒的还原的思维方式，认为它是对科学的因果律的接受，将事物的本质还原到其所由发生的根源上去，就弗洛伊德对梦的解释而言，即追因溯果地追问到梦所由而生的生理学原因。这种还原的结果最终只能获得人的一些基本本能，充其量也只能获得一架心理骷髅或一个类人猿，这对人的活生生存在有何意义呢？尤其对现代文明人的存在有何意义呢？因此我们对个体无意识的探寻，对远古遗传至今的集体无意识原型的探寻，其意在于回复到现今，并且朝向未来，探测其预言的意义，使生命具有更深邃更丰富的力量，从而建构起真正的人性来，这也就是对席勒的最完满的人性的最终解答。这正是荣格赋予“象征”的全部内涵，也是他浩瀚的理论寻索的最终目的所在。

以上文字可视为我阅读或重译《心理类型》的感受，也是对二十年前的译序的一点补充。细心的读者必然从这部荣格的代表作中所获更多，我不过是一个最先的阅读者罢了。
